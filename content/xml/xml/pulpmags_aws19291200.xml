Such early experimenters as Lilienthal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chanute--as well as Wright Brothers--all used</seg><seg type="columnLine">gliders without motors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Gliders are of several different types, the early</seg><seg type="columnLine">gliders having been double- and triple-winged;</seg><seg type="columnLine">whereas the modem gliders of to-day are of the monoplane</seg><seg type="columnLine">variety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the present time, glider flying threatens to become the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sport of the air and is coming rapidly to the forefront in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">country. During the period after the war, the Germans have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done marvelous work in glider flying and, recently, a young</seg><seg type="columnLine">German stayed aloft over eighteen hours in one of these gliders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">relying simply upon the updrafts of the air to keep him aloft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This may sound incredible: but it is an accomplished fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shows us what may become possible in the future.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Roughly speaking, the modern glider takes advantage of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward currents of air, particularly as they occur around hilly</seg><seg type="columnLine">country. This is considered true glider flying; but there is still</seg><seg type="columnLine">another method whereby a glider can be towed by means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cither a motorboat, an automobile, or a regular motored airplane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The automobile towing and motorboat pulling methods are,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, not considered good form by glider experts, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">prefer to soar like birds free of all entanglements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, our work in glider flying is as yet a crude begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning, and no one knows its possibilities. Sooner or later, it may</seg><seg type="columnLine">develop into a commercial means of transport in a manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we do not even suspect to-day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For instance, the Germans have recently made a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiments which were highly successful. Two gliders were</seg><seg type="columnLine">towed by means of long ropes by one engine-propelled airplane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus they have made a real train, similar to our locomotive-and-</seg><seg type="columnLine">car combination. They argue that, with little additional energy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is possible to lift up three airplanes, two of which are engine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, and transport either passengers or freight through the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">at an exceedingly low cost. This seems plausible because the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest part of the weight of an airplane is the engine, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">this is absent in a towed glider. The extra weight, usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken up by the engine, can be used in the glider for freight</seg><seg type="columnLine">or passengers. When the towed glider nears its destination, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot of the glider cuts loose from the tow line and glides down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to earth. This landing, the Germans point out, is very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">easier to accomplish in a glider than in a motored plane;</seg><seg type="columnLine">because the angle of glide is much less on a glider--it can cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">a greater horizontal distance while descending.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All sorts of possibilities, aside from the sporting clement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">open to us in the field of gliders. We may be sure, for instance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the future air liners will carry "lifeboats" in the form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gliders. Other possibilities are gliders with a sort of auxiliary</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine; without propellers, but using rocket propulsion through</seg><seg type="columnLine">compressed air or some other means. The auxiliary power</seg><seg type="columnLine">system would be used only to maintain altitude. For instance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a glider, if it were released from an altitude of one or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles, could glide down in a flat angle, thereby covering a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance of thirty or forty miles in such a glide. No power of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any kind would be needed, except to lift the glider up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">required height. It may be even possible to go back to the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot-air-balloon system to raise the glider to the necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">height. Ordinary straw or woqd burned underneath the balloon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like contrivance would furnish all the buoyancy for a temporary</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper or silk balloon to lift up the glider.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the other hand, there is a tremendous possibility in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">country for gliders, purely as for sport. While no such spec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacular flights have been made in this country as in Germany,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time is rapidly nearing when America will be on a par with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Germany in glider construction and operation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And let 110 one think that it is an expensive sport. Good</seg><seg type="columnLine">gliders that can carry one man can be built anywhere from</seg><seg type="columnLine">$50.00 up, and they can be flown practically anywhere where</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are hills or where there arc prevalent winds with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">velocity of fifteen to twenty miles an hour. Nor is the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">sport dangerous; for the planes are very light. Even a crash</seg><seg type="columnLine">is of little consequence; and there seems to be no record of</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone having been killed flying a modern glider.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Glider flying is certainly one of the greatest and most</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhilarating sports as yet devised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">485</seg><seg type="columnLine">And now the remaining planes, unmindful of the awful power flashing from their adversary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged straight at him. But before they were fairly under way, one of them began to wobble;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then it dropped in a tail spin to the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">486</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BLUE DEMON</seg><seg type="columnLine">By the Author of "The Air Terror'*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Y	plane was a complete success.

Jealously guard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the salient features of its construction, and swear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing every air official and pilot to secrecy, the govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment sought to maintain its monopoly of the invention.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Although I wast still horribly crippled in body by</seg><seg type="columnLine">my fall in the hour of victory, I could endure the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardships of my new life in the knowledge that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped save my country. Only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud shadowed my happiness, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was the disappearance of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">old friend, Lon Grand, the man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made my success possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our late enemies had resumed dip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lomatic intercourse with us, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole world was again at peace. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, with the stunning suddenness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a thunderclap from a blue sky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came new rumblings of disturbance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our security.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My good friend, Colonel Brandon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been promoted to the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand of the First Corps of our air</seg><seg type="columnLine">squadrons, was lost at sea with every</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship of his fleet, which comprised</seg><seg type="columnLine">three hundred of the largest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftest aircraft in the service!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first tidings of the disaster</seg><seg type="columnLine">came by radio to the Air Depart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment at Washington.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was only silence--profound and mysterious. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">vain the radio operators throughout the country tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pick up further details. Every ship on the sea and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air, within a radius of five hundred miles, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">besieged by frantic appeals for definite news of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tragedy.

The mystery deepened. Many</seg><seg type="columnLine">theories were advanced, only to be rejected as unten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able.

Yet that seeming impossi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility had happened.

It seems that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been cruising at a high altitude at noon the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vious day. Their position was a hundred miles east-</seg><seg type="columnLine">north-east of Strawberry Point, and through their</seg><seg type="columnLine">glasses they saw Colonel Brandon's ships circle out over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea and begin their maneuvers.

They swept both sea and</seg><seg type="columnLine">air with their glasses; there were no boats in sight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the air above the fleet was free from planes. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few, low-hanging clouds were visible, and above them</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky was blue and unflecked by a single object. But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while they continued to gaze in amazement, plane after</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane pitched about, rolled over, then dived down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">its doom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nearly all were down and had been swallowed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea when the watchers' own plane developed motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble, and they had to glide down. Being without</seg><seg type="columnLine">a radio transmitter, they were unable to report at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mysterious catastrophe; and only after many hours'</seg><seg type="columnLine">work on the motor were they enabled to limp into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boston.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whole nation was stunned. Out of a peaceful</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky had come sudden death to more than two thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, and destruction to the stanchest air fleet in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. Every ship was constructed throughout of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal, and was supposedly capable of keeping afloat</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a rough sea for hours. Yet all had been destroyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a few minutes, and not even a scrap of wreckage</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been left to tell the tale. Uncle Sam's newest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">best-equipped air squadron, which our military experts</seg><seg type="columnLine">had declared invincible, had been annihilated within an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour of our coast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it seemed that nothing could be done about it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No aircraft had been seen above or below the fleet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before its destruction began. Neither had there been</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible a warship or a submarine near to husband other</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes; and, even though there had been such an agency</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent on the destruction of our planes, how could it have</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplished its purpose so swiftly and completely?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nor could the government, through all its diplomats</seg><seg type="columnLine">and agents, located in every capitol on earth, obtain</seg><seg type="columnLine">any inkling as to the cause of the disaster. Other gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernments and the foreign press were very sympathetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and courteous; but all other nations were as much in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark as and mystified as we. It was as though an</seg><seg type="columnLine">avenging angel from on high had suddenly appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smitten the planes. Soundings were made at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point where the fleet was reported to have gone down;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the depth was too great for the work of divers, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing was salvaged to aid in the solution of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a few weeks the wrath and the excitement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our nation began to cool; and, as the weeks merged</seg><seg type="columnLine">into months the prominence of the affair faded as life</seg><seg type="columnLine">resumed its normal course. The tragic loss of the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">squadrons was recorded among the archives of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world's unsolved riddles. Folks now began to doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the story of the Boston aviators. Meanwhile the gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernment was still secretly probing the mystery while it</seg><seg type="columnLine">set diligently to work to repair the loss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was then that the whole country was shocked by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sudden repetition of the dire tragedy--but this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was late in the afternoon in mid-November; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky was overcast and the earth below was drenched by</seg><seg type="columnLine">fog banks swept along by a cold, raw wind. The Sixth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Air Squadron, comprising more than one hundred fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing planes, while returning to the home port at Annapo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lis from maneuvers in the west, was feeling its way</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the fog above the Blue Ridge Mountains. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly radio messages leaped out of the air with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direful intelligence that it had been attacked without</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning by an unseen foe; that the planes, suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown out of control, were pitching about wildly and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">crashing into the hills. And then, as in the case of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colonel Brandon's ill-fated command, communication</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the fleet abruptly ceased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Air Department at oncc ordered all available</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes to the rescue. Since I happened to be in An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">napolis on a motor trip I swung out of the automobile</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my crutches (on which I was now able to move a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short distance) and made my way over to the flagship</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fleet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Want to come with us, Mr. Clare?" inquired Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mander Benson genially.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded and he helped me into the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were all too much excited to talk as we shot up</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the banks of fog and then darted westward</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the Blue Ridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although our speed was great, darkness had fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the time we reached the vicinity of the disaster.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The dreary blackness of the night was intensified by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold rain that swept down from the north. Beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moan of the storm, the slither of the rain across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wings, and the subdued murmur of the motors there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no other sound. But the fog had lifted and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot our searchlights into the gloom in search of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foe. Nothing but the flare-illumined hills was visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then fearfully we set the beams of our lights earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, hoping against hope and dreading the revelations</seg><seg type="columnLine">we knew were in store for us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon we located the crumpled wreckage of the squad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ron, strewn over the rocks and scattered about over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushes and among the trees of the forest. Some planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were impaled on tree-tops, some had crashed against</seg><seg type="columnLine">hillsides; and others lay deep and almost Concealed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom of wooded gulleys.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg><seg type="columnLine">What the Planes Revealed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS we dropped down, seeking a spot on which to</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, it was apparent that every plane had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed. As before, the work, of the unseen</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiends had been thorough. But here, at least, they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left a clue. Here no sea had destroyed the evidence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here we had something tangible to work upon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We finally landed on a flat space, near one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed planes. The officers, with Commander Benson</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the lead, sprang from the cabin and rushed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreck. On my crutches I hobbled after them as fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I could with the assistance of two of the crew. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, standing there huddled together in the rain, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared dumbfounded and speechless at the ghastly sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">our flashlights revealed. With one glance we saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the bodies of the plane's crew were in the cabin;</seg><seg type="columnLine">none had had a chance to jump. Two of the pilots</seg><seg type="columnLine">still sat in their seats, their stiffened hands gripping the</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls, their staring eyes wide and terrified as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">death had come unexpectedly. The remainder of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew sat in their places or sprawled on the floor. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most appalling thing about them was their color;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skin of each was a pale, yellowish blue! We pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the sleeves of one and opened his shirt front. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole body was blue! But we could find no wounds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">abrasions or burns of any kind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We saw that all had been killed instantly by some</seg><seg type="columnLine">subtle and powerful force. Nor did the planes them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves show any marks of battle: what damage they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">received came as a result of the crash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Commander Benson sighed and looked around with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bewildered stare. I saw that he, like the rest of us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was completely mystified.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God!" he breathed at last. "This is awful! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BLUE DEMON	489</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the color of the corpses! I never saw anything so hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible. To think that the boys had no chance--never</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chance!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon the mountain slopes and through the valleys</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could now see the bobbing lights of other searching</seg><seg type="columnLine">parties. Some were near us and hoarsely called out</seg><seg type="columnLine">their reports and discoveries. All coincided with our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I almost believe that we are dealing with the devil</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself," said Commander Benson grimly: "These</seg><seg type="columnLine">men have been killed by some electromagnetic agency,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am sure. Yet we find no burns or marks upon their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies, nor do we find signs of fire upon the planes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the eyewitnesses of Colonel Brandon's destruction</seg><seg type="columnLine">affirm that they distinctly saw fire enveloping at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the planes, as it plunged to the sea. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what they saw might have been the flashes of sunlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the metal parts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Despite that fact, we may have here a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">method of destruction," I suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is possible," agreed Captain Collins: "Here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as in the case of the Brandon tragedy, our known facts</seg><seg type="columnLine">are meager. We are at peace with the whole world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For months there has been not even a diplomatic quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rel. And here we can find no trace of an enemy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where, then, can we look for a solution to this dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery?" The captain paused and looked at us with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a startled air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Commander Benson stared and scratched his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have one thing to work on, Commander, I said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You will recall that only military planes have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacked. And it is only our planes that were de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed ; and it is a significant fact that they were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most powerful in the world, so far as we know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By George, I believe you j(re right, Clare," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Commander Benson : "Our enemy, whoever he is and</seg><seg type="columnLine">however he accomplishes his dastardly work, has a mili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary reason for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And it strikes me that he has covered his tracks</seg><seg type="columnLine">well," said Captain Collins, dryly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nof by a damned sight," snapped Commander Ben-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, glaring about him savagely: "We'll get this blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">demon of the skies or sell our lives in the attempt."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Amen," we all agreed solemnly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Dearth of Clues</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UNFORTUNATELY, there was nothing we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do that night to salvage the planes or to succor</seg><seg type="columnLine">their unfortunate crews; for all were dead, all tinted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by that horrible blue color, all with that expression of</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise and wonder on their faces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We sought shelter from the storm in an airport</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the mountains and sleepiessly awaited the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the dawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day broke bright and clear, and after a hasty</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast we returned to our sad task. The bodies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brave airmen who had sacrificed their lives to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown foe, without opportunity to strike a blow in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their defence, were gathered together reverently and</seg><seg type="columnLine">conveyed to Washington. During all this work we</seg><seg type="columnLine">made but one more important discovery--nearly every</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane had been smashed beyond repair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Diligent inquiry among the residents of the sparsely-</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled region failed to bring us any clues. No one</seg><seg type="columnLine">had either heard or seen any strange planes in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">vicinity--only the regular mail planes had passed. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">one had heard any sounds of battle or commotion in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skies. Nor had any strangers been seen upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roads for many weeks. Those abroad on the roads in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the vicinity of the tragedy on the night of the storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen or heard nothing unusual.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We kept up our inquiries for days, and patrolled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air for miles around, but without result. And finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were forced to go home; sadder, but no wiser.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The national wonder and excitement following this</seg><seg type="columnLine">tragedy was even greater than the aftermath of Colonel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brandon's end. As usual in such cases, the public</seg><seg type="columnLine">blamed the government for not discovering and pun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishing the miscreants. Mass meetings were held in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every important city, and red-faced orators called loudly</seg><seg type="columnLine">for action against the weaklings in our administration.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Resolutions condemning everything and everybody in</seg><seg type="columnLine">general were offered and adopted by the score. Action!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Action! was the cry. The censure of the Air Depart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment was unreasonable in the extreme. The public</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildly demanded an investigation, and the removal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">punishment of certain high officials, whether guilty or</seg><seg type="columnLine">innocent. With the blood scent in their nostrils they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were looking for some prey. It was pertinently asserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, probably, the secrets covering our military planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been betrayed to a foreign power; and that men</seg><seg type="columnLine">high in the councils of state, in collusion with said</seg><seg type="columnLine">government, had entered into a conspiracy to destroy</seg><seg type="columnLine">our chief arm of defence. Incredible and preposterous</seg><seg type="columnLine">though as this accusation was, it found thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">adherents among the thoughtless; thus embarrassing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the administration and hindering any sane solution of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the problem.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While public opinion was still at white heat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">official Washington seemed on the verge of collapse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nation was terrified by the news that our unseen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown enemy had again struck. This time the vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tims were small groups of planes and single units far</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed from help; but the results were the same.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our men had been sent to their death without warning</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a chance to defend themselves. In no instance did</seg><seg type="columnLine">these planes have an opportunity to use their radio.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The same sickly blue tint was found on the victims'</seg><seg type="columnLine">skins. Although, in a few instances, the planes had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been seen to go into a spin and fall, no one had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">what struck them down. All declared that this awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">power, whatever it was, was invisible and the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly thing the world had ever known. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no clue, no explanation, no chance to apprehend the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible destroyer. We were further astounded by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">news that the agents of this monster had struck in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">score of places within the short space of an hour; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">always the victim had been a military plane!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The nation all but went mad. For days both business</seg><seg type="columnLine">and industry were virtually suspended; men and women</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout the country stood about in groups discuss-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in accents of awe and terror the visitations of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">power. It was apparent to the most obtuse that, unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">this damnable thing were speedily curbed and rendered</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmless, our country would soon lie prone and help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less under the heel of a conqueror. Yet what was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be done? How were we to grapple with a foe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be heard or seen, the only evidences of whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence were the grisly reminders of its visits? But</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were somewhat comforted by the fact that the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilized world sympathized with us. Every power,</seg><seg type="columnLine">large and small, sent condolences and lavish offers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">aid. But these gracious sentiments, reassuring as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, did not help us to solve the mystery. The situ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation was acute--the future pregnant with horror and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disaster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In sheer desperation the Air Department finally sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me. Why it did so, God only knows, for I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged as deeply in the morass of fear and uncer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">490	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tainty as any nephew of Uncle Sam. However, I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">gladly; though I was somewhat ill at ease as I entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the council room and gazed upon the grim, gray faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the nation's leaders grouped about the long table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have known Commander Benson for years, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to state now here that no braver man ever sat at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the controls of a plane; but when he came forward to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet me, and took my hand, there were tears in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">honest blue eyes, and for a moment he could not speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Clare, for God's sake help us," he finally said</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarsely: "We are at the end of our rope and unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">something is done mighty quick our country will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the rocks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How can I help?" I asked humbly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hardly know," he replied with a gesture of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spair: "But we have hoped that, as the inventor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane, you might be able to suggest something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One of the inventors," I corrected sharply: "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget that there was another associated with me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We then went over to the table where Commander</seg><seg type="columnLine">Benson introduced me--really a superfluous proceed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, as I was known to nearly every man there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We earnestly desire your opinion, Mr. Clare," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Air Secretary, "with regard to this nameless scourge</seg><seg type="columnLine">that has swooped down upon us. We think that you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, may be able to show us a way out. Please</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak frankly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">My Plan</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I GAZED about the room. The heavy shades on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows were down and the doors were closed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Have no fear," said the Secretary divining my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts: "We speak behind closed doors, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire building is under guard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gentlemen, I deeply appreciate this confidence," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "though I fear that there is little I can do to un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravel the net of perplexing circumstances that sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounds us. However, I have arrived at certain con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusions which I have hitherto thought best to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">to myself, but which I now frankly make known for</seg><seg type="columnLine">what they may be worth. Allow me to say, then, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seems to me that we are still psychologically at war</seg><seg type="columnLine">with those powers with whom we made a formal peace</seg><seg type="columnLine">several years ago. Our victory over them, as you know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was due to the superiority of our planes. This bitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact still rankles in the hearts of our erstwhile foes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ostensibly at peace with us, I believe they have secretly</seg><seg type="columnLine">invented some devilish engine of destruction and en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaged in this underhanded campaign to destroy our</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief arm of defence. When this is accomplished, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">will come out into the open, declare war and have us</seg><seg type="columnLine">at their mercy. It is clear to me that they must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a base somewhere in the old world, also one here in</seg><seg type="columnLine">America. I would advise that a close watch be kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">on all the capitals in the East."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our secret service men have been working in those</seg><seg type="columnLine">countries since the loss of Colonel Brandon's fleet,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the Secretary: "but they have found nothing."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"As the attacks have all been made on our military</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes,'' I resumed, "I think it would l&gt;e wise to remove</seg><seg type="columnLine">all such planes from active service, so far as possible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and confine them within their hangars and home fields</seg><seg type="columnLine">until we can locate and grapple with this menace which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Commander Benson has aptly named the 'blue demon.'</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, since this destroyer, whatever it is, comes out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skies we must look for it there, we must battle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcome it there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am convinced that this unknown enemy of ours</seg><seg type="columnLine">is using an electromagnetic force," I went on: "It may</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from a great distance, or it may be directed at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">comparatively close range. But it lias occurred to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we might insulate against it. Of course we do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not understand the nature of this ray--if ray it is--</seg><seg type="columnLine">for, although invisible, it leaves a blue stain which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would indicate that some sort of chemical action forms</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of its characteristics. Yet, I believe that we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">insulate against it. Our secret air patrol should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly augmented; but I would suggest that all planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sent into the air in single units widely scattered."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Clare, I think your idea of insulating the planes a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty good one," spoke up Commander Benson:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Somewhere in the air this deadly thing lurks. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">what, in God's name, are we to look for? No one has</seg><seg type="columnLine">reported any suspicious-looking aircraft loitering about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and who among us is astute enough to recognize this</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue monster should we meet him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course no one had an answer to these perplexing</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions. Indeed, it seemed an absurd and impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">task, to hunt for and fight an invisible foe. That we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to thank an old enemy for these hellish crimes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there could be no doubt. But what enemy? We could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not charge any nation with such dastardly conduct in</seg><seg type="columnLine">times of peace; such an accusation would be equivalent</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a declaration of war. Yet all realized that some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing must be done, and that soon. The temper of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people demanded drastic action of some sort. War</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all its carnage and heartache was preferable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this supine submission to the frightful attacks of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown foe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For several minutes a poignant silence hung over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room; the very atmosphere of the place was eloquent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the uncertainty we felt. All realized that the life</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a mighty nation was at stake; and the thought came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me that here among those grim and silent men about</seg><seg type="columnLine">that table must be found a savior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last General Marshall rose in his place. His face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pale and seamed, his lips set; but his eyes, deny-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the years of his snow-white hair, blazed with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ardor of youth. General Marshall had been a pioneer</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the early days of the air defence; he had sounded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tocsin of warning and the call for an adequate air</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet until he had won his point against immense odds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now his advice was eagerly sought and followed, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">by those who once had been his bitterest opponents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Secretary," he !&gt;egan in clear, firm tones, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">recommend that Mr. Clare's--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused abruptly and stood staring wide-eyed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loud speaker in the center of the table as the Air</seg><seg type="columnLine">Department's code signal rasped out on the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Secretary," came the announcer's hoarse voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the government airdrome at Annapolis: "I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the duty to report that three more battle planes have</seg><seg type="columnLine">just crashed on this field; and our hangars are in</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We stared at one another in helpless dismay. Slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as in a daze, every man got to his feet and waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathlessly for the next words. This was the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunning blow that had yet been struck. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">boldly attacking our planes in their home ports! They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were burning our hangars before our very eyes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed that we were helpless to do anything to thwart</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. We gazed in awe at the loud speaker, but no</seg><seg type="columnLine">further words came. In some manner the announcer</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been cut off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I recommend that Mr. Clare's proposal be adooted."</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued General Marshall at last, his cool, collected</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice tending to relieve the tension: "I further recom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mend that he be placed in charge of our air scouts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">empowered to act at his own discretion and in his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">way: that all red tape pertaining to his duties be slashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BLUE DEMON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">at once, and that he be given every possible aid in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">execution of his plans."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg><seg type="columnLine">After the Demon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT once a loud clamor arose. The enemy was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">our doors again, we must get a fleet under way</seg><seg type="columnLine">' immediately and hunt down this destroyer; there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no time to lose in experiments--and so on. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the midst of this hue and cry General Marshall held</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his hand for silence. At last, in deference to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">years and experience, the commotion ceased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gentlemen," resumed the general, "I beg you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">curb your impatience. To assemble and send out an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other fleet against this masked invader would be sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">madness. Our inability to cope with him openly has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been demonstrated to our sorrow. We are dealing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new form of enemy, unseen, deadly and without</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercy. As Mr. Clare has suggested, our best hope is</seg><seg type="columnLine">to render our planes immune to his thrusts--if we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">do so--for only in this way may we learn the secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his power and destroy it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Clare, how long do you think it would take to</seg><seg type="columnLine">insulate a fleet of--say--a dozen scouting planes?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked the Secretary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps two weeks," I replied: "But I take pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure in informing you that already I have one plane in</seg><seg type="columnLine">readiness." They all turned in their chairs to stare at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me incredulously. "I have anticipated the need of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a plane," I went on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you are ready to take the air in it?" gasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Secretary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am, with your permission."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Good 1" exclaimed the Secretary, his face brighten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing: "How do you propose to work?" he added quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hardly know," I confessed: "Our task is un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">precedented and we fight blindly. Circumstances must</seg><seg type="columnLine">largely guide our action. We know not where to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">for this monster. But I propose to go into the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">after it, to stay in the air, refueling from supply planes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until I either run down and destroy this infernal power</seg><seg type="columnLine">or am destroyed by it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A murmur of applause followed, but I was far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling as brave as my words. This indefinable, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen terror had worked on my nerves, too, and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in very truth fearful of the ultimate outcome. To lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">our envied position as leader of the world's air powers</seg><seg type="columnLine">was humiliating enough; but to have these children of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my brain destroyed without being able to strike a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow in their defence was maddening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Commander Benson sprang to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I urge that Mr. Clare's services be accepted at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once," he said crisnly, "and that he be dispatched on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his errand without delay."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You shall have a free hand," said the Secretary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking my hand. "Pray take your insulated plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">and go at once; and may God speed you!

I said, swinging toward the door</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">491</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on my crutches. With our hangars burning and our</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole air fleet menaced with destruction, I knew there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no time to lose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We took to the air that very night and began an</seg><seg type="columnLine">aimless ramble through the skies. I say aimless; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">such it was, so far as destination and a campaign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">action were concerned. We realized that one lone plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">against an invisible antagonist of whose size, power</seg><seg type="columnLine">and location we had but vague conceptions, stood but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a meager chance of success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The weather was cold but beautiful. Not a cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted across the star-studded sky. There was scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">any breeze and the air was clear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To our surprise the weather continued fair for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next three weeks, and we enjoyed it to the best of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability considering the constant strain we were under.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was one of those calm, clear Decembers we some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times have along the Atlantic coast. Day and night we</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailed the sky, sometimes far inland, at others far at</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea, changing our course and altitude frequently. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing occurred to stir our blood or mar our voyage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All was as serene and peaceful as a country church-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard. The demon had not been heard from again. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">people began to lose their fear, and we to feel like fools</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a wild-goose chase. But the government did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">relax its vigilance. By this time more than a score of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new, insulated planes were on scouting duty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, one day, as we flew high over the ocean, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather suddenly changed. Clouds began to gather</seg><seg type="columnLine">and roll up from the east. The wind freshened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought with it a chill. In less than an hour, we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the clouds, and so we dropped to a warmer</seg><seg type="columnLine">stratum of air. The cloud banks mounted rapidly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we thought that the whole heavens would soon be</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanketed; though the sky to the west was still clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We turned landward, not wishing to be caught in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a storm. But, as we sped on, I looked back at the roll-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing clouds and studied them idly. Then my attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">was suddenly attracted to four curiously-formed clouds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">detached from the main mass and drifting slowly north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward. These cloud formations, perhaps a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards in circumference, were white and irregular in</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape with long, feathery streamers and columns pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">truding and floating from the edges and curling about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main body. And, as I looked, I fancied that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were spots on the surface that billowed, rose and fell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffed up and subsided like the slow exhaust from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam pipe. And, in the center of each cloud, was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of snow-white vapor such as one often sees scurry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over the water in the lap of a gale. Through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">binoculars the clouds seemed to be composed of fog</seg><seg type="columnLine">particles rather than rain-laden vapor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Funny-looking clouds," remarked Captain Price,</seg><seg type="columnLine">observing my intense interest. I handed the glasses to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damn curious," he said, calling Captain Collins'</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention: "The barometer remains stationary and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can see no cause for this peculiar condensation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Their motion is contrary to the drift of the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds," remarked Collins. "It is strange that, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are getting the wind from due east, that those clouds</seg><seg type="columnLine">so near us and at the same altitude are moving north."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So saying, he turned the plane about. Without ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioning his motive we continued to stare as we flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to within a quarter of a mile of the clouds; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused in a hover to watch their motions. To our sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise, we saw that they were no longer drifting. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">erratic air current had released them and they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">now motionless. Their surface no longer heaved and</seg><seg type="columnLine">492	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsated as though with life. Only the long ribbons</seg><seg type="columnLine">of exquisite cloud tracery, as delicately fashioned as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most intricate lace, still swayed and waved around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edges as though blown about by the wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are just ordinary clouds, after all," said Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain Price in disgust, "I thought we were about to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover some new meteorological marvel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">What Came from the Clouds</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I DON'T know what made me gaze up into the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">just at that time--so remarkable are the coincidences</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life--but I saw a dark object descending swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">from thousands of feet above us. Down it came with</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible speed; and then, to my surprise, I saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a large plane similar to our own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One of our boys has spotted us," I said, calling my</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion's attention to the plane. But, to our amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, this new arrival seemed not to have seen us, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not wish to make our acquaintance; for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came on down straight as a stone. At last he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a hovering rest about two hundred yards from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange-appearing clouds, which now seemed to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and merge with the dark background of vapor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly something blinding flashed above the new-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comer's plane, scintillated and flamed out like a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror in the sunlight, while spirals of blue fire ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">along his wings and seemed to leap from them.

Look!" cried Price.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following his startled gaze, we saw a large, white</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane below the edge of the clouds go hurtling down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He dropped out of that cloud," said Collins in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">low voice of awe. "And where's the cloud ?" he added</seg><seg type="columnLine">in bewilderment. "I'll swear it was there but a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was right. There were but three of the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds left, and they seemed about to be absorbed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark masses behind them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They have drifted into the other clouds," I ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lieutenant shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There goes another I" cried Captain Price, grabbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">my arm in his excitement, just as I again saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">appalling flash of fire on the stranger's plane. But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even before the stricken plane struck the waves, I ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served that another white cloud had completely dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared. Before we had a chance to recover from</seg><seg type="columnLine">our amazement, or to discuss the startling occurrence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we saw a third plane dart from the cloud bank out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">control.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At him!" I shouted wildly. "It is the 'blue demon,'</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he is killing our friends. We will be next."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before the words were out of my mouth, my pilots</seg><seg type="columnLine">were driving the plane forward at terrific speed. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">last we were to come to grips with the ruthless beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the air that had eluded us so long. The remainder</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our air forces would be saved and the darkest mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery that had ever stained our military record would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be solved. But, as we rushed on, we were greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarmed and puzzled by the tactics of our strange enemy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For several moments he retreated; then paused as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">in doubt, while his plane was bathed in a dazzling</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheen of fire. Then, as we stared agape, he shot away</seg><seg type="columnLine">with bewildering swiftness and melted into the clouds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He has beaten us!" gasped Captain Price. "Damn</seg><seg type="columnLine">him 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chagrined and humiliated, we stopped in the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the clouds. We could not see ten yards into that</seg><seg type="columnLine">black, rolling mass. •AVe hesitated to penetrate its folds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">However, we were given scant time to consider our</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem. A cry of alarm from Lieutenant Collins drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">my attention. Several hundred feet above us, and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right about a hundred yards away, we saw another</seg><seg type="columnLine">large, white plane, like the ones already sent down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerge from the clouds and dart toward us like a shot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We gazed apprehensively--probably the same thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the mind of each--was this newcomer friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">or foe? And then I saw that the fourth white cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">had disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Because of the sudden chill in the air we had closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin. Every window, door and port was shut;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but we watched the oncoming plane through the heavy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">plate glass windows wondering whether to meet it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spirit of friendship, to retreat or to give battle. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a biplane, but of a pattern radically different from</seg><seg type="columnLine">any we had ever seen. Its fuselage was extra large and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung low, and it carried two motors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Lord!" suddenly exclaimed Collins. "Look,</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything is turning blue!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We stared aghast. The air outside was swiftly as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suming that deathly, terrifying hue that was associated</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the "blue demon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep the cabin closed," I cried. "If that blue stuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets in we are doomed. And--and--boys, the insula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion works!" I added triumphantly. "Let's ram him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So we turned and darted toward the plane that by</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time had reached our own level. I say darted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which should be the right word, for our motors and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other machinery were functioning splendidly; but to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our amazement and consternation, we were barely mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing! Some great repellent force, like the blast of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gale, was holding us in check. In vain we tried to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crease our speed, knowing that without it our foe held</seg><seg type="columnLine">the advantage. Yet he was not firing at us. We saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sign of life about the plane. The weapon he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">using against us was the swift and silent one of elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricity. But there was no flash or fire about the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">white bird to indicate it--it was apparent only by that</seg><seg type="columnLine">indistinct blue haze and the powerful agent that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">retarding our flight. There seemed to be nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do but to turn back and retreat. Yet I knew by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stem, grim faces of my pilots that such a thing had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not entered their minds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They motioned me to the controls and aimed the for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward machine-gun as we slowly forged ahead. At first</seg><seg type="columnLine">our shots made no impression, neither did the foe re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treat. But at last in the midst of the fierce rattle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shots we saw the white plane quiver, bank suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then go into a nose dive. We had scored a hit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, after a drop of several hundred feet, she flattened</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and darted south like a bullet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After him!" shouted Price.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then we bent every energy to the chase. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gratified that the force that had checked us had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been removed and that, although the blue haze still sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded our plane, we had recovered ourmormal speed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And our foe was mortal--we had wounded him--we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had repelled his terrible ray, and he was running from</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. However, it took us but a few minutes to discover</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we had an adversary worthy of our steel, so far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed was concerned. Save in our own planes I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never witnessed such rapid flight. Mile after mile the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white plane held her own despite our most strenuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts. She flew due south, maintaining one level</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not deviating a hair's breadth from her course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll bet they are making for South America," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Price. "I have seen many places along the Orinoco</seg><seg type="columnLine">where an airplane base might be safely hidden. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherever she leads we will follow," he added savagely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BLUE DEMON	493</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Amen," said Collins. "We will follow him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat him to a frazzle, because our insulation renders</seg><seg type="columnLine">us immune to his devilish ray."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Men of the East</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT our ambition to discover and destroy his base</seg><seg type="columnLine">was doomed to disappointment. Before two hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed, the wind suddenly increased, assumed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proportions of a gale, shrieked about our ship, buffeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and straining it in every fiber. Soon the whole heav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ens were black with storm-tossed clouds across which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lightning ran in vivid tongues of fire. The rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell in torrents and, as a deep twilight settled about us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea was blotted out in the mist, and ahead we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see nothing but a gray wall of swirling rain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Loudly cursing the weather, Price looked at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think we had better land," I said in answer to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">question in his eyes. ''We've lost track of the plane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyhow, and it is not likely that we can pick it up again</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this storm."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps the scoundrels will go above it," suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant Collins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If they were not damaged they might," I said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But, now that we are off their trail, I think they will</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the opportunity to land on some desolate spot to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make temporary repairs. We have made a good start</seg><seg type="columnLine">today--we have met the 'blue demon' in actual combat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all but beaten him. Let us console ourselves with</seg><seg type="columnLine">these facts. We will go toward shore, lay up for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night and perhaps to-morrow we may have better luck."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accordingly we turned west, and in a half hour, fly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing low, we saw a flat, sandy island beneath us. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">this we landed and made things snug for the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The storm continued for several hours, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn broke clear. The wind had veered to the south,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now dying away, was breaking up the clouds above</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tossing sea. Patches of blue sky showed at inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vals and through a rift in the clouds we sailed up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sunshine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shall we go back home, or continue south for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spell in the hope that we may sight our quarry?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's keep on for another day at least," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Price.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I agree to that," said Collins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As that was my notion also, we accordingly set our</seg><seg type="columnLine">course south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The clouds were breaking up rapidly. We sailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">high above them, flying leisurely and keeping a sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookout for the white plane. Suddenly, through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">break in the vapor, we saw it just above the sea. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed was much more leisurely than that of the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will drop down and rip him open," said Price</seg><seg type="columnLine">joyously: "We've got him this time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Remembering the deadly blue ray, we closed every</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening of the cabin as we began our dive. But we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not to have an easy victory. Hardly had we left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shelter of the clouds when he saw us, and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the island we had just left. Once more that thin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue liaze surrounded us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep your damned rays to yourself," sneered Col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lins. "They don't bother us any."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was true--we felt no discomfort--and this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ray, or whatever it was, seemed to have lost its</seg><seg type="columnLine">potency. It had not the power to seriously check our</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Something mighty serious has happened to those</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds," said Collins gleefully. "They've lost their pep</seg><seg type="columnLine">and are sure our meat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the great white plane put on a sudden burst of</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, and at the same time our engine began to miss.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We lost speed and the plane's nose dropped. We came</seg><seg type="columnLine">up quickly, however, and once more got above our</seg><seg type="columnLine">adversary and sprayed him with bullets from our ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine guns. Again he out-maneuvered us and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed. Captain Price cursed roundly as the beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">white creature zoomed up out of reach. We saw their</seg><seg type="columnLine">game--they would get above us and once more elude</seg><seg type="columnLine">us among the clouds. But tfiey were too slow. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the tremendous force at our command we came up</seg><seg type="columnLine">under them, tore into their fuselage and broke a wing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, as we drew swiftly back, the white plane, like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crippled bird, lurched drunkenly, then plunged, a whirl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing streak of white, to the ground. It landed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clump of palmettos and burst into flame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a fever of haste and anxiety we landed near and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried toward the burning plane, fearing that the fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">would rob us of the fruits of our victory. I reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plane, by extraordinary effort, just behind my pilots.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fire was roaring around the motors; evidently some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gas pipes had burst in the crash. The cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">was badly shattered, and protruding half way through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a broken window hung the body of a dark-skinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. My companions pulled him from the wreckage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried him aside and laid him under a palmetto. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a handsome man with raven-black hair and jet</seg><seg type="columnLine">black eyes; his features were finely molded and regu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar, his hands small but muscular with tapering fingers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his build athletic. A purple turban, its scarf awry, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some high-caste oriental, or I'm a goat," exclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Price.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We stared at one another. Who could be our myster-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ious opponents ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the cabin of the wreck, we found the body of an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other oriental, garbed like his comrade, but of shorter</seg><seg type="columnLine">stature. A careful search revealed no sign of any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">being about the craft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All efforts to extinguish the fire with sand were</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless. We could only stand back and watch it bum</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself out; which it did when the petrol tanks were</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When at last the metal parts had cooled sufficiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be handled we went about among them and exam- |</seg><seg type="columnLine">ined them with care and awe. Despite the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the motors and the other machinery were blackened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and warped, their rods, valves and dials broken and</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted by the intense heat, they presented an intricate</seg><seg type="columnLine">maze of delicate and wonderful mechanical construc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. We poked about among the mass, but the fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">had destroyed the great secrets which we sought. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not explain the functions of the ruined batteries</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tanks, those queer-looking motors and pumps. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not rearrange the severed wires. We could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">reconstruct the melted mirrors,- reflectors and trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formers. Nor did a diligent search of the unburned</seg><seg type="columnLine">portion of the plane reward us with a single document</seg><seg type="columnLine">to help us in our problem; in fact there were no papers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any kind, no records or plans. Who were these men</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the east ? And by whom were they sent ? Only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scant wardrobe and a little bedding were all that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">found in the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The damned assassins have covered their tracks</seg><seg type="columnLine">well," snapped Price disgustedly. "Our victory is</seg><seg type="columnLine">barren."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In a degree, that is true," I acknowledged ruefully,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"for this plane, as we witnessed in the skirmish yes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terday, is but one of many--maybe thousands--hiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">away somewhere awaiting a favorable time to strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">494	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">us. But of course we have made a little progress against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enemy; and we have uncovered two rays of hope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our planes are more than a match for them in battle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it is evident that they are fighting among them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My companions stared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The fight we saw yesterday seems to prove that,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I went on: "The plane that got away from us in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds is a distorted copy of our own."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is so," agreed Price. "Evidently the two fac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions arc jealous of each other. But, added to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">other problems we have discovered another--compli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cations with some foreign power."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That will work itself out in time, I believe. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">now we must set out for home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Foe Invades Washington</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE got home without further adventures. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">report to the Air Department was held secret;</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a word leaking out to the public.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For several days all was quiet. The weather was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair, business was good, and once more the people be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved that the worst was over. Then, one day, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">midst of a storm, the enemy again struck. It happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Washington above the Capitol itself. Six mili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary planes which had not yet been insulated, winging</seg><seg type="columnLine">their way home to Fort Myer, were suddenly attacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">and destroyed. Their wrecks were strung along in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">zigzag line extending from the Washington Monument</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the Lincoln Memorial. Every man aboard them</seg><seg type="columnLine">was killed; and every body tore that grisly blue mark</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mysterious slayer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The National Defence Council, assailed on all sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a righteously indigant and suspicious public, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smarting under another bitter reminder of its impo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tency to stop the slaughter of its planes, assembled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">extraordinary session. The atmosphere of the chamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one of gloom and despair. My pilots and I were</seg><seg type="columnLine">called in to recite the incidents of our battle with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The theory of Captain Price, that this awful thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">may have a base in South America, I think a sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">one," said Commander Benson. "I believe that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be well to send planes to scout in that region.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Besides, I believe that our secret service should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubled in every capital in the world. Although we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have just witnessed another example of the demon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cunning and power, we feel that we are making some</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress toward its annihilation. Mr. Clare and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilots have demonstrated that the insulated planes are</seg><seg type="columnLine">invulnerable to its attacks, and no plane so insulated has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been destroyed. However, I feel that our progress</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the solution of this mighty problem is slow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, unless we can hasten it, the price we will pay for</seg><seg type="columnLine">our delay will stagger humanity. Therefore, I earnestly</seg><seg type="columnLine">recommend that every available factory in the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">be run night and day for the construction and insula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of military planes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Commander Benson's recommendations were adopted</seg><seg type="columnLine">without one dissenting voice. And then I asked for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">privilege of conducting another night patrol off Boston;</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was in obedience to a hunch rather than to any</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite analyses. Not knowing when or where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">demon would strike next, one patrol district would</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem as likely to produce results as another. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the startling sequence of events proved that sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hunch may be right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We took the air night after night, and nothing hap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to us for a week; but in the meantime over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land we continued to lose planes--sometimes singly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other times whole flights. And then, one Sunday</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, our luck turned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The weather was magnificent. The full moon rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">high, flooding the sea with silver as we swung out</seg><seg type="columnLine">over it. The sky was clear, with only a few billowy</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds to freckle its velvety, star-strewn dome. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds, which drifted lazily along in a light breeze, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered and irregular in size; but off to the right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a few miles from shore, was a group of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">foggy clouds, their ^vhite, fluffy banks and ridges stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing clear and bright in the soft light. There were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">others near them. They were of about the same size</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shape; and, as we passed, I watched them curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously and counted them. There were seven.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We went on. For some time no one had spoken--</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtless every one was under the mystic spell of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mellow night. Then I noticed Price staring fixedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the rear. Suddenly he rubbed his eyes and seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">the binoculars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look there, boys," he exclaimed a moment later.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I just counted those clouds when we passed--there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were seven--and now there are but four! And--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">--for the love of God, look! In their place are three</seg><seg type="columnLine">white planes--the planes of the blue demon--and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are being attacked."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unable to believe our eyes, we stared like fools.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Above the three white planes had suddenly appeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though projected from empty space, the great craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had escaped us before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ".There's our baby again," exclaimed Collins glee-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully. "We've got him this time, or I'm a lubber."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he swiftly turned the plane back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now, as we approached them, we saw that amaz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing blue fire blaze and flash and circle about the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it bore down on the white fleet. Then, one after</seg><seg type="columnLine">another, the remaining four clouds vanished suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving in their places four more white planes!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We stared at one another speechless with amazement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were now seven white planes, each the exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">counterpart of the one we had forced down on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandy island. They had moved unseen within a mantle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of clouds--and one of the great mysteries about our</seg><seg type="columnLine">foe was solved. Under cover of their cloud screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had approached their victims and struck them</seg><seg type="columnLine">down by means of some infernal power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What dumbheads we all are!" I exclaimed in dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gust "Why didn't some fool among us discover that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we lost no planes during clear weather--that clouds</seg><seg type="columnLine">were always about ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what about that fellow that seems to be all</seg><seg type="columnLine">afire?" asked Price, "is he friend or foe? Foe, I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking, for he ran from us. Probably he is the leader.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And yet--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain paused for want of words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We came to a hovering stop less than five hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards from the white planes. Two of them suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rtose-dived to the sea. Then, as the remaining five</seg><seg type="columnLine">zoomed and dipped and banked in their mad efforts to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape the same fate, their aggressor gained altitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a swift, upward surge. He quickly wheeled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left and brought all five white planes upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter. Again his plane blazed with blue and green</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yellow fire; and three more of the white planes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose cloud curtain had been mysteriously dissolved,</seg><seg type="columnLine">went lurching down and were swallowed by the waves!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now we were surprised to see the two remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes, unmindful of the awful power flashing from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their adversary, charge straight at him. But, before</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BLUE DEMON	495</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they were fairly under way one of them began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wobble; then it dove straight into the air, only to drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in a moment in a tail-spin to the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It now became a death struggle between the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maining white plane and its terrible antagonist. Still</seg><seg type="columnLine">hovering there inactive, not knowing who was friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">or foe, if either, and expecting to be attacked by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">victor, we stared silently at the remarkable battle. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">some strange manner the white plane, although now</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the aggressor's attack, managed to parry</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fiery thrusts and to return again and again to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack. For the first time we noticed a pale, blue ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">dart intermittently from the cabin of the white plane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then we suddenly realized that its great foe had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard hit; no longer the fire flashed from its wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fuselage. It began to retreat at an upward angle</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the thrusts of its enemy. Three times it re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and attempted to ram the white plane, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">always eluded it. But we could see that the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane also was badly crippled. Its movements had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become slower and they lacked their usual skill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the big plane drew away from its white foe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It rose higher and higher with a slow, unsteady motion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while we followed at a distance, and the white plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept climbing and circling after it a hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">below it. Then, to our utter amazement, we saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man emerge from the cabin of the upper plane, walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">out upon a wing and pause there, staring down at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy. A blue smoke was issuing from the fuselage</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him, and the Whole plane was trembling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying as if about to fall. The man was without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">parachute, and we wondered what he had in mind as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he continued to gaze down at the circling plane. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter did not finish him off as he stood there, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair and open target, we could not imagine. But likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">its pilots were hard pressed to keep the plane in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">An Astounding Discovery</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE white plane still circled closer in its narrow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing orbit, passing directly under the man on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wing. Suddenly we saw him gather himself for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God, he is going to jump!" I cried aghast. "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">is going to leap to the other plane!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then as we stared in dumb and silent awe he sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the air. Straight down he plunged, and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gauged the plane's motion well, for he alighted squarely</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his feet in the center of its wing. He swung him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self down to the cabin and entered by an open door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A few hoarse cries reached us, mingled with the clank</seg><seg type="columnLine">of metal striking metal, then all was silence. But in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment the plane staggered into a nose dive. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand feet it dove as we followed after, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that it was surely about to crash into the sea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet, after a moment, it flattened out and turned toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sudden mighty rush of air now thrust us aside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the great plane which had just been abandoned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">careening madly from side to side, rushed past us</seg><seg type="columnLine">and buried itself in the ocean. Intent on watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white plane, we had forgotten it momentarily and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">near being crushed by it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile, the crippled white plane, paying no at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention to us, was painfully making its way toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, with crazy, uncertain glides. It was evident that</seg><seg type="columnLine">its navigator was nearly spent and was seeking a haven</seg><seg type="columnLine">of refuge on land. At last he reached the shore, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">grazing the top of the cliffs, and came to a crushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop in a stony field a quarter of a mile inland.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">As soon as possible, we landed by the side of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wrecked plane and rushed forward. The first human</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures we saw were two turbaned orientals, dressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the two we had vanquished. One glance and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that both were dead. Each had a smile of devilish</seg><seg type="columnLine">defiance on his dark face, a smile of haughtiness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disdain, and their wide-open staring eyes held no shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fear. Hurriedly we looked for their intrepid con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">queror. Then we saw him lying on his face, wedged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in between the pilot's seat .and the instrument board</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he doubtless had fallen when the plane struck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blood was flowing freely from a wound on his head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he was breathing. Collins and Price pulled him</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and laid him on the ground beside the cabin. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then as I bent over him my senses reeled drunkenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for a moment I doubted the evidence of my eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For I was gazing at the rugged, honest face of Lon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grand!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good God, boys!" I gasped. "This is my long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost friend ! This is Lon Grand!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stared at me incredulously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He was fighting our battles," said Price at last,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and to think that just a short time ago we were try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to send him down to Davy Jones!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must get him to a hospital at once," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever-ready and resourceful Collins as he knelt to bind</seg><seg type="columnLine">his handkerchief about Lon's bleeding head. "Price,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he continued, placing his hands beneath Lon's shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders, "you take his feet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We soon had Lon aboard our plane, then as the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cited natives of the locality ran up, we shot into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air and headed for Portsmouth, the site of the nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospital. On the way we radioed to the Air Depart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment to secure the wrecked plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It took heroic work to save Lon's life; although he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no severe wounds or injuries save that on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. For weeks he lay in a coma; but at last science</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tender nursing prevailed and he came out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows--came from under the mental cloud that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed him so long. Calm reason without a glint</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fear, doubt or uncertainty, now glowed in his splen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">did eyes. Doubtless the blow he had received in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">last mad fight had proved his mental salvation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Day after day and often far into the night I had sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his bedside praying that his life be spared. I left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the work of the air patrol to others. But it was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">without particular interest, for the attacks of the "blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">demon" had entirely ceased. But so frail was Lon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold on life, and so fearful were the doctors that any</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden excitement might again unbalance his mind, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was another month before I was allowed to reveal</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself to him and ask him to tell his story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is but a simple tale, Clare," he said modestly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gazed fondly into my eyes. I sat by his wheel-chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding his hand in a warm clasp. "I am sorry that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have been unable to tell it to you sooner for now it</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be too late unless--" He paused and looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me with a whimsical smile. "Unless your insulated</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane has turned the trick," he finished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have turned the trick yourself, Lon," I said</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmly. "You alone saved us, but we are just dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know how you have wrought this miracle. We have</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost no more planes since that last heroic battle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours. I reckon the 'blue demon' is sleeping."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The blue demon," repeated Lon reflectively: "Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the name is appropriate enough. But I can't under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand why they have let up in their attacks. Still, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">are many other things about this strange enemy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ours that I can't understand. One thing I do not posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively know--its identity. Think of it--I who have</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived among the conspirators, supped and slept with</seg><seg type="columnLine">496	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">them--cannot with certainty name their nation. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">I leave the enigma for each man to form his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To go back to the beginning," resumed Lon after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pause, "we all know how the invention of your plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely vanquished our enemies from the east.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beaten and humiliated, it was natural for them to at'</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt to learn the secret of its construction. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ironclad discipline of our government's air forces pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vented this. You know, old pal, how I wandered away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from you in the clutch of one of my queer spells before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the war was over. This time my aberration must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">lasted for weeks and months. I can recall only hazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimmerings of my life and actions for some time. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not know just what happened to me, but I must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been drugged and kidnapped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''When at last my senses returned in a measure, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found myself in a wild, mountainous country contain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing dense forests and great, level plains. I was sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised to find that my companions were orientals be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">longing to a proud and ancient caste now banished by</seg><seg type="columnLine">their government. I was treated graciously, housed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable quarters and given to understand that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were my friends. Then came the great surprise. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">head man, a rajah, tall and proud and powerful, came'</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see me. He informed me bluntly that, since I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the secrets of my country's great airplane, I was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reveal it to him and to assist him and his followers in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the building of planes like it. He also politely gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to understand that, unless this information were</seg><seg type="columnLine">forthcoming within a reasonable time, my life was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay the forfeit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Well, I begged for time to consider this startling</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposition; and while debating it I was allowed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">roam around at will. Then it was that I made some</seg><seg type="columnLine">astounding discoveries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The little valley where I was held a prisoner har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bored a town of several thousand people, and in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">center, ready for operation, was an airplane factory</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which the whole population was expected to work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I discovered that this was an inaccessible region in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north of India, unknown to the outside world and sel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom visited. It was presided over by this rajah who,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I take it, was a sort of social outcast from his particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">caste. He was a merciless despot; but everybody there</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to worship him and worked uncomplainingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his iron rule. Hazy as my mind was, I gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this worthy was in the pay and confidence of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful eastern nation, and that he was to turn the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new planes, when finished, over to it. Thus this power,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while presenting a friendly face to the United States,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was secretly planning its destruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At last I pretended to fall in with their plan, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">under one subterfuge and another I delayed the work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I didn't know-what to do; but I was determined to sac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifice my life rather than betray my country. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to live, gain the secrets of this strange band of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and aid in preserving my country. Fate helped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to solve my problem. One evening just at twilight</seg><seg type="columnLine">while returning alone from a stroll in the valley I saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">from assassins the life of a young oriental of good</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeding, education and intelligence. A low-caste</seg><seg type="columnLine">laborer, for some fancied injury, was about to stab him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the heart when I stepped between them, receiving a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh wound in my own chest. The young man, Rel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">goon by name, from that time, on was my friend. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him I gradually imparted my desire to outwit my</seg><seg type="columnLine">captors, to escape and to reveal their secrets to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">government. He agreed readily to aid me, and with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">solemn oath pledged his life to my cause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At last, a model of one of our super-planes was</seg><seg type="columnLine">started. I built it as near like ours as 1 could remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber; but I introduced some changes. The plane was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly under way when we were visited by a fleet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful white planes, all manned by members of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">band. I was taken on board one of the planes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">given a ride in the air. I was frankly told that these</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes possessed some remarkable features, far superior</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the American planes which they wished me to study</seg><seg type="columnLine">and incorporate in the plane I was building. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown the apparatus of the invisible death ray they</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried, which was capable of killing a man at the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance of two thousand yards, which could be intensified</seg><seg type="columnLine">and directed at a minute target.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Most astounding of all, they possessed a devilish</seg><seg type="columnLine">contrivance to screen their movements. This was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine for generating a fog cloud which they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep about them as they sailed and in which they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie concealed for hours, especially when blended with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the real clouds of the sky. Yet through this cloud they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could send their ray, directing it by means of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">hellish electric eyes which I was never able to discover</seg><seg type="columnLine">and copy--my old think-box functions but poorly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now Relgoon and I, working hand in hand, set</seg><seg type="columnLine">out not only to equal these damnable instruments, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">also to improve and surpass them. You know, old</seg><seg type="columnLine">scout, that I have always been quite apt in the field of</seg><seg type="columnLine">electromagnetism. So, while neglecting to build a cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">creator in the new plane--giving as my reason that</seg><seg type="columnLine">owing to the plane's peculiar construction it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">best to install it the very last thing--and remembering</seg><seg type="columnLine">that one of the most obstinate elements menacing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety and navigation of all planes is fog, we created a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fog dissolver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When the plane was ready for the air, but still in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete in equipment, I invited the rajah and several</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his officers aboard and we went for a trial flight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The plane surpassed all my calculations. It behaved</seg><seg type="columnLine">superbly, responding to all maneuvers with marvelous</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed and precision. The rajah was delighted. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubbed his hands together in glee, I fancy in anticipa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of some nation's gold that was soon to cross his</seg><seg type="columnLine">palm. While he was in this good humor I disclosed</seg><seg type="columnLine">my new dissolver, casually reminding him that fog was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the most troublesome and dangerous of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">obstacles of aviation. I desired to try out the invention,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if successful, to install it on our new planes. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was favorably impressed with the idea, and by radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ordered one of the white planes to approach us</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrouded in its cloud mantle, little dreaming that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was negotiating the collapse of his golden dream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In due time the plane appeared in its glorious white</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud. I pointed the dissolver, and lo, its fog was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shattered and the plane revealed in a twinkling. Nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">could the plane again build up its cloud under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack of my rays.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The rajah was prodigal in his praise as we returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to town. He was immensely gratified that my work</seg><seg type="columnLine">had merged without friction into all his plans. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">given more freedom and was accorded every honor</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the little band possessed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Escape</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">** A T last the plane was complete, even to the intro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duction of the projector which sends out the ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its poisoning power and its peculiar hue. But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a fool, at the last minute I neglected to install the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fog producer; I was in such a big hurry to get away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Secretly, bit by bit, Relgoon and I provisioned the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BLUE DEMON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">49Z</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and made it ready for a long voyage. Then, during</seg><seg type="columnLine">one dark night of rain and wind, when the sentinels</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sought shelter from the storm, while the few lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the city blinked dimly through the mist and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people of the town were asleep, we stole over to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hangar, doped and bound the guards, ran out the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">and zoomed up through the rain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''We made but little headway during the night; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">by morning, the storm having lifted, we sailed out over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pacific. Cruising along the islands of Japan we</seg><seg type="columnLine">encountered heavy fog banks, but by means of our dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solves which cut a clear path through the vapor fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards wide and about five hundred yards long, we sailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it easily without slackening speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Three days later we landed among the cactus of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northern Mexico, because we were forced down by</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor trouble. To avoid arousing the suspicion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the natives and being subjected to unpleasant question-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, we represented ourselves as United States military</seg><seg type="columnLine">aviators. But owing to the remoteness of the region</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the indolence and the red tape of the officials it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was over a month before we were repaired and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the air. Then we were stunned to learn of Colonel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brandon's sad fate. I saw how it was--the mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastern power, learning of our escape and fearing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we would soon warn our country, had determined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rely on the prowess of their own devilish contraptions</seg><seg type="columnLine">and destroy our planes one by one before they could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why I did not immediately reveal myself and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane to the proper authorities is one of the great puz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zles of my mental illness.

So, immediately we set out to hunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">and destroy these white planes which, though deprived</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our inventions, had nevertheless set out to destroy</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. But we had a great advantage unknown to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy.

Whether the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had been college chums made any difference, I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know; but he arranged for me to see everything.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, as we waited for the Eastern Star to loom into</seg><seg type="columnLine">view, each passing minute served to increase my im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patience at the delay. I wanted to be off- I was as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to be away from the scenes of my brain-killing</seg><seg type="columnLine">business as a youngster waiting for vacation time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After half an hour of waiting, I was becoming ill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">humored. I stared about the waiting room on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground level just under the anchoring pylon and, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tenth time, I noticed the two elevators which</seg><seg type="columnLine">nestled in a corner, ready to take their loads of pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sengers upward some six hundred feet. I glared with</seg><seg type="columnLine">baleful eyes at a small, pale man, the announcer, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat at a switchboard near an open exposure, fingering</seg><seg type="columnLine">a row of push-buttons. Frequently he gazed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window at the sky exposed before him and I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell by the impatient look on his wizened features that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Eastern Star had not yet put in her appearance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Somehow, I had a baseless feeling that he alone was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to blame for the delay of the air leviathan and added</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the fact that I strangely disliked his looks. I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">FLIGHT OF THE EASTERN STAR	501</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">almost like grabbing him by the collar and casting him</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the window. I was angry at the ship's delay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry and ill-humored at the beginning of the adven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. I suppose my days of bachelorhood had created</seg><seg type="columnLine">within me a certain temperament that could be satisfied</seg><seg type="columnLine">only by instantaneous compliance with my wishes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the little man spoke into a tube, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room reverberated with the rasping sound of his am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plified voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eastern Star, forty-five minutes late, is now nosing</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to anchor. Passengers will deposit their hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">baggage with the checker for delivery .on board the</seg><seg type="columnLine">liner. The Eastern Star will take off in exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighteen minutes. Tokio first landing! All aboard!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a sudden scramble toward the elevators.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At a signal from the operators, the little man pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a button on his keyboard and the doors closed; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifts were moving upward rapidly. I shot a glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the station's great windows; a deep shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">was darkening the space, and I felt a slight jar as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge ship's nose came into contact with the electro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnetic plates which drew her downward to anchor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My ship had arrived at last; but I waited on the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Jack Worthington until the rush for the elevators</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ceased; though I was anxious to see the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of the Eastern Star.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently Jack ushered me to one of the lifts; at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were wafted upward and deposited on the closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform. A ship's officer was waiting on the landing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glancing nervously at his wrist watch. He looked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bowed to Jack Worthington, who was mumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to himself about the expense of a forty-five-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute delay. Far below, the din of busy city life</seg><seg type="columnLine">clanged irritatingly in my ears; even though the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">was muffled by the enclosure. There was the clatter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scraping of baggage, as the two-score handlers</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted it from the express elevators and shot it down</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the liner over bearinged ramps and through com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed-air chutes. Then, as I understood, it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sorted out in the ship and labeled according to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">destination -- Tokio, Peiping, Nanking, Calcutta and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other points.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Markson, a rather large, muscular man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray hair and steady blue eyes, appeared and addressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm mighty sorry, Mr. Worthington," he said seri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously, but with a trace of nervousness in his manner:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But I think I can make up that forty-five minutes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">once I get up in the rarefied-air regions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course you can, Captain," Jack replied, smiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a lightness that I knew was forced. "What hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to you over the Rockies?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We were cruising along at our regular clip," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain explained, "when we ran head on into an up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">draft, some miles east of their usual area; I hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected a suction-stream so far east. I was in for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I knew; but we managed to fight out of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">without any damage, although about half the passengers</seg><seg type="columnLine">are almost nervous wrecks. There's a lot of old women</seg><seg type="columnLine">on board, you know; mostly school teachers from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Middle West, wanting to see the Orient from the air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anyhow, the up-draft was not as severe as some I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have encountered in the past; but it took forty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes of steady fighting to keep from being lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond our altitude limit, and get out of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There must be quite a blow over the Rockies, Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain ?" I put in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Worse than an ordinary blow, sir," he replied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">positively. "There's no comparison between an up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">&gt;r down-draft and a blow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is my friend, Mr. Rodman, Captain Markson,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack said by way of introduction: "Take care of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard.

M., local time, Thursday. If you fail in making</seg><seg type="columnLine">delivery by that hour, the company will lose the</seg><seg type="columnLine">$100,000 guarantee which we have given against delay."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't worry, Mr. Worthington," the captain re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied: "We'll arrive in Peiping hours before that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bullion will be delivered on time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A uniformed officer brought the ship's clearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers.

"Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I just wondered if there were any chance of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">raid upon the gold," the captain returned: "Well--</seg><seg type="columnLine">there won't be any up-drafts to delay us between here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Peiping, sir.

Be sure to see me when you get</seg><seg type="columnLine">back."</seg><seg type="columnLine">502	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A gong clanged somewhere in the interior of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eastern Star. I stepped down the passageway lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into the craft from the platform. Captain Markson</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed close behind. He pressed a signal button as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he entered the open side of the ship; and I heard some</seg><seg type="columnLine">unseen machinery hum softly. I glanced back in time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see two heavy steel doors sliding together; there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a soft snap as they locked tightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The interior of the ship where I stood beside Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Markson seemed to be an arched passageway; the walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">were spotlessly enamelled and the floor thickly car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peted. The captain led me well toward the center and</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused before a row of small elevators, one of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon whisked us upward to the main deck. I was sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised at the luxury manifest in the decorations of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eastern Star. On every hand stood massive divans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">upholstered chairs, thick, oaken tables finished beauti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully; the walls were adorned with paintings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tapestry. No great hotel was more lavishly decorated</seg><seg type="columnLine">than this expansive salon before me. I was elated;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for here was comfort indeed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The salon seemed strangely vacant, however; and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">presumed that, somewhere in the ship, there must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deck from which passengers could look down to earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wave adieu to their loved ones as the craft moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from her anchoring pylon. But, before I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquire of Captain Markson if there were such an</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyrie, he addressed me:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Would you like to come up into the control room</seg><seg type="columnLine">to watch the take-off, Mr. Rodman ?" he asked. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast off in another minute."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You bet, Captain I" I said: "I'd like to watch it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">I followed him out of the reception cabin, along a</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-lighted and roomy passageway, toward the nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ship. We went up a flight of carpeted stairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and entered a large, circular room, over which seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a dome of thick, transparent glass. A dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniformed officers stood at various posts in the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bination bridge and control room. A man wearing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">braided visor stepped forward and saluted snappily:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All ready, Captain I" he said. "What orders, sir?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Signal the ground man to break the magnetic con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tact, Madden," Captain Markson said, crisply: "Start</seg><seg type="columnLine">the electromagnetic power distributors for the usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">vertical take-off. Rise to 2,000 feet and set the course</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicator at 30-30-2."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very good, sir!" Madden turned to a control</seg><seg type="columnLine">panel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was not disappointed in Madden's famous visage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is no injustice to a gallant officer to say that he is</seg><seg type="columnLine">indisputably ugly; though it is only an uncouthness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">features. For, to offset it, the pleasant twinkle in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale eyes seems to compensate whatever natural an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tipathy the unusual set of his features aroused. He is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not repellent, mind you. He has an odd personality</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make him respected by a man, if not admired by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentler sex. And, as I learned to know the man in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">later hours of the flight, I found that he is an excel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent officer, a fine navigator and--as Jack Worthington</seg><seg type="columnLine">had said--a good sport. Should I ever need a friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a pinch, a real man in a tight place, I will select</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madden to stand by me in place of a score of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose-lipped, Apollo-faced gentleman of the ballroom</seg><seg type="columnLine">variety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Near-Catastrophe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was Madden who was first at the control when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unexpected thing occurred; and it was Madden</seg><seg type="columnLine">who brought the Eastern Star to an even keel when</seg><seg type="columnLine">her nose suddenly dipped earthward under the pressure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of her driving exhausts. Just how the near-catastrophe</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened, when the ship cast herself free from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">anchoring tower, 1 do not know; although 1 learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">later that one of the four pilots had neglected to test</seg><seg type="columnLine">the elevators to make sure that they were in position</seg><seg type="columnLine">for upward flight. As the result of this negligence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the Eastern Star had risen to the necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">2,000-foot level, her nose shot earthward at a terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">clip under the power of her exhausts. I was thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a corner by the abrupt dive of the ship as her tail</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted skyward. 1 had one glance through the observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion windows of the control cabin and saw the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing up rapidly. Then I caught sight of Madden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who--with a bound like the spring of a panther at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">victim--leaped aside and grasped a reserve elevation-</seg><seg type="columnLine">control wheel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Eastern Star's nose missed the tops of the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings by inches, rather than feet. Then, with a force</seg><seg type="columnLine">that caused her interior bracing girders to groan under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pressure of a sudden upward thrust, it swung up;</seg><seg type="columnLine">while her keel grazed a spire opposite the Plaza. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship seemed to leap into the air almost perpendicularly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With my arms locked around a rigid, stationary pilot</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, I clung in this precarious position to prevent my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self from being hurled to the far end of the cabin; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like hanging by the arms from a horizontal bar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs dangling. Fearfully, I glanced upward. Frantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers were clinging to various handholds, struggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">to maintain equilibrium. Only Madden seemed cool, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stood braced at the chair to which I clung. I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not see his face, yet I felt that, if the ship should escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">total destruction and those on board and in her path</seg><seg type="columnLine">below be spared, then Madden alone could be thanked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw him loosen a foot from its anchor around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. His boot scraped on the metallic floor as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought a signal pedal to increase the power of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving exhausts which, I was to learn, propelled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eastern Star. With a jerk the huge air leviathan</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped upward, skimming the roof of the rebuilt Hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Justice. Simultaneously with the sudden upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust, I heard the roar of her exhausts as they shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar jets of pale blue flame rearward from below</seg><seg type="columnLine">her tail laterals. Then she floated on an even keel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I arose, shaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Markson stood in the center of the cabin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs planted apart and arms akimbo, again in com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand. During the few long seconds when our lives</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung in the balance I had not seen him once. His face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now livid and his mouth twisted in a rage!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Madden!" he shrieked: "Stay at the wheel!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Walton, Blunt, Wilson and Baker, come here!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I mopped the perspiration from my brow with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking hand while Madden tensed at the controls;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the four pilots whom he had called detached them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves from the maze of instruments before them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dejectedly faced the captain. I glanced earthward;</seg><seg type="columnLine">throngs of onlookers filled Main and Spring Streets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking like white dotted insects as they stared upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the huge ship. I heard Madden growling to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self and I looked at him. His face was calm enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his senses entirely under control; but he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mumbling of dire things to perform on the persons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain negligent pilots who had permitted the near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">catastrophe to happen. Just what had caused it I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon to learn, for Captain Markson bellowed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounting rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What in hell do you fellows mean by neglecting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">test your elevators before your ship is put under way?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he roared. "Which one of you is to blame? What</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of pilots are you--correspondence-school gradu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">FLIGHT OF THE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ates or just elementary students? Haven't you been</seg><seg type="columnLine">drilled to test every one of your controls after landing?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why did you neglect to lift your elevators after we</seg><seg type="columnLine">anchored ? Are you all so damned ignorant ?. Answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">me you--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Baker's Choice</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AN utterly dejected young pilot stepped forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saluted. Captain Markson frowned on him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and raised an arm as though to strike him full in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. But he controlled himself and raged, his ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like lists twisting perilously close to the officer's fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Speak, you idiot--you murderer!" Captain Markson</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellowed wrathfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The officer's lips quivered for an instant before his</seg><seg type="columnLine">words finally came forth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was my fault, sir," he said tensely, his face sickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale: "Mr. Madden ordered me to take charge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Control One for the take-off. It was my duty to test</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laterals and set them for upward flight, sir. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an accident that I overlooked it, sir!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Markson stared at the man curiously for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant and then blew up again:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So it was you, Baker?" he roared, stepping back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to survey the negligent pilot of Control One. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned, and tore from the wall of the control room one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its framed certificates, and thrust it at the pilot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man, Baker, took it from him meekly and hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're through, Baker!" he said. "Madden!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swing around and circle the station once at landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">velocity! Baker, you will report to Mr. Worthington</seg><seg type="columnLine">for your check! Prepare for a 'chute landing at once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir! Walton, Blunt and Wilson, return to your posts!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pilot Baker stood for an instant, as though i rooted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the floor, unable to move; then slowly he walked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parachute rack, selected his own device and donned</seg><seg type="columnLine">it rapidly. The other three pilots, glad to have escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the wrath of their commanding officer, returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their various controls. Captain Markson strode to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">side and peered intently through the observation ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posures: then faced around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As a civilian witness, Mr. Rodman," he said, "you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will bear me out in this decision at the Federal inquiry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You understand the situation as well as I do; I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make another landing if time permitted it, but I can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">not afford to lose any more time.

I'm sorry, sir, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">such damnable negligence has cursed my command."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I regarded him curiously. His features were stern</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hard-set. The Eastern Star was skirting the tower-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing City Hall obelisk. Her nose tipped slightly earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, and I glanced around to observe Baker. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was standing in the center of the floor before a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratively small round hatch, that yawned as the cover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was thrown back; and he was prepared to step into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the discharging cylinder. The ship seemed to hover</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the anchoring towers for an instant. With a last</seg><seg type="columnLine">look around the cabin, Baker faced Captain Markson</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saluted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good-bye, sir!" he said in half whisper that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely audible: "It will never happen again sir!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I dislike to discharge you this way, Baker," Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Markson said, his eyes softening for a second: "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's for the good of the service and the protection of</seg><seg type="columnLine">aircraft passengers! Good-bye, sir, and good luck!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baker eased himself into the tube which, I discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered, was for the purpose of saving the lives of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship's forward crew in event of accident. That was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EASTERN STAR -	503</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">true, but it was no life-saving device for Pilot Baker.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shuddered as he passed from view, haunted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">look in his eyes as he glanced, strangely, toward me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Markson peered earthward for a sight of float-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing silk; what he saw caused him to start violently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hurtling earthward was only a rapidly decreasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">speck; Pilot Baker had elected to die rather than face</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disgrace that he knew was in store for him!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A whining siren caused me to jump nervously, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the falling speck, hoping to see the silken cloth</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulge upward. I tore my eyes away. Captain Markson</seg><seg type="columnLine">strode swiftly across the cabin and pressed a button</seg><seg type="columnLine">below a three-foot square screen; it glowed with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrathful features of Jackson Worthington. Jack's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice came through an amplifying reproducer to reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">every nook and cranny of the control room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the devil's going on in your ship, Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Markson ?" he demanded: "My God, you caused a</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic that injured twenty people on the ground with</seg><seg type="columnLine">your crazy antics! What's wrong, Markson ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Accidents have happened since man began to travel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir," Captain Markson replied tensely: "Pilot Baker</seg><seg type="columnLine">neglected to elevate and damn near smashed us up! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">discharged him, sir, and sent him down in a parachute.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have already lost fifteen more minutes and I cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">afford to make another landing. I hope he arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He didn't, Markson!" the official growled: "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">field men are cleaning up the mess now! What about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inquiry?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stepped to the captain's side as he spoke again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your friend, Mr. Rodman is a witness, sir!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said evenly. "He will bear me up.

I put in, edging close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen so that my features would be transmitted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him: "It was Baker's negligence. He confessed to it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Anyhow," Worthington said, "that doesn't let us</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of heavy damage suits.

Gradually, the Eastern Star picked up speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she sped on her belated course to circumnavigate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the globe. Madden slowly increased her driving power</seg><seg type="columnLine">until a faint hiss reached me in the control cabin. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a desire to inspect the propulsion principles of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge craft; but elected to await the time when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement and ill-humor should have passed from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds of the officers in charge. I wondered what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">transpired among the other passengers during those</seg><seg type="columnLine">few seconds of dire danger back at the station.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Markson interrupted my thoughts by re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieving Madden of the supervision of the controls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The first officer relinquished the post without a word;</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though it were a usual thing for the captain to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">504</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">assume that duty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll take her until we get beyond the coast, Mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den!" Captain Markson said, staring at the instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments: "Seems as if I can't trust anybody on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship of late. Anyhow, the barometer indicates low</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure over the Pacific. I'll navigate her through it!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Very well, sir!" Madden replied: "Shall I go</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the ship to see how the passengers have come</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By all means, sir!" the captain grumbled^ "Take</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Rodman with you and show him the ship. Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rodman, this is First Officer Madden. I'll join you</seg><seg type="columnLine">later when I feel safe enough in turning the ship over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to these nincompoops!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Madden smiled, and led me out of the cabin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the corridor toward the reception room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quite a close shave, Mr. Madden," I said, as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">strode side by side down the hall: "Let me congratu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">late you upon your prompt action in saving the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">from crashing, sir!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All in the day's work," he replied quietly: "Such</seg><seg type="columnLine">things are bound to happen at times. I happened to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the closest man to the reserve control; any one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others might have done the same trick."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But they didn't," I replied: "We would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed, without a doubt, if your mind had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">working rapidly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you, sir," he said, looking straight ahead:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nothing about that though to warrant a hero medal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Baker was a damned good pilot-navigator 1 I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't see how he overlooked the elevators!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Seemed rather young to hold a pilot's rating?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">put in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thirty-five is the best age for a pilot. Baker was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty.

I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't know, sir," the officer replied, shaking his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head: "From what I could see he wasn't much of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixer; that is, he didn't confide much in his mess.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Old Man never did take much fancy to him; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't hop fast enough for Captain Markson. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain is a flyer of the old school, who flew ships when</seg><seg type="columnLine">aircraft still had struts to hold 'em together. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we have all-cantilever ships, he thinks the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">need the struts to keep 'em up on their feet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Panic had reigned, temporarily, among the pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sengers of the Eastern Star when her convolutions</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw them about, in spite of the customary starting</seg><seg type="columnLine">precautions. But, when Madden and myself had com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted the tour of inspection, we were elated to discover</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had quieted down after the first scare, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of them had retired to their cabins. Several had</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffered slight bruises and abrasions from the tumblings</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had received. But, on the whole, things were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">much better condition than Madden had anticipated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Mr. Rodman," Madden said presently: "There</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be a few more minutes before your dinner time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If you are free, I'd like to show you the mechanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">workings of the Eastern Star. _ I presume you are in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terested to know just how she is propelled?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've wondered about its mechanical embodiments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Madden," I replied. "I've always felt an interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">in mechanics, physics and aero-dynamics; although I</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand but little of any of the sciences. If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't mind showing me around---"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We went down a short companionwav to the engine</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms where powerful units of machinery hummed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the great craft swung swiftly through the heavens</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the northwest. I was awestruck by the com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pactness of the units. For such a large craft, I rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected to find the Eastern Star's machinery spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">all over an engine deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just inside the door, behind a screen, and extending</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the breadth of a room, were immense batteries of</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrical units, that fairly sputtered under a bombard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of rapid-fire electrical charges which seemed to fly</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one post to another, sizzling and crackling not un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasantly. They seemed alive with power. Thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">cables ran from each unit to a central manifold, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">virtually glowed under cover of a green phosphores-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cence. From the manifold extended another series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cables, heavily covered with a lead-like metal. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared behind an unattended panel. It was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tip of my tongue to inquire about them; but Mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den, sensing my curiosity, volunteered the information.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These 'bats' distribute high-frequency current to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignite the driving explosives," he said simply: "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cables run from here to another chamber in which are</seg><seg type="columnLine">housed the compression units. In internal-combustion</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines, a high-voltage spark is used to explode the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gases in the cylinders. The Eastern Star's propulsion</seg><seg type="columnLine">principles are along the same lines; yet, instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasoline, paralene or other highly inflammable liquids,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we use a combination of fuels in the form of a powder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is driven into combustion chambers by centrif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugal pressure. There the fuel is mixed with oxygen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploded and driven through twelve separate units</seg><seg type="columnLine">forming the driving-exhaust systems. You probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed the exhaust tubes extending outward from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigid lateral platform at the tail?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No I haven't, Mr. Madden," I confessed. "Frankly</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've never seen the Eastern Star or even her pictures</seg><seg type="columnLine">before."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">An Amazing Ship</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE stared at me blankly, as though questioning my</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignorance of this tremendous air leviathan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What?" he said incredulously. "You've never seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">this craft on her inspection tour around the country.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought everybody had."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am ashamed that I must confess my ignorance</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, Mr. Madden," I replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then I will enjoy the pleasure of making you ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quainted with her, sir," he said: "It is rather odd that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man of your position has not had a chance to investi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate such progress in aviation as this ship has de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've been too busy in the last few months attending</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my own business affairs, to look into others, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madden," I said: "But I welcome this opportunity</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the "battery" room, we entered another</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber; a half dozen perspiring men stood beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">compact, oblong cylinder blocks, and watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gauges that rested on panels above them. A low hum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the almost inaudible purr of a new automotive</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine, issued from each of the heavy steel units.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were in the room twelve such metal blocks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged horizontally across it. By each stood huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal cylinders, each individually attached to its block</seg><seg type="columnLine">by means of bright metallic tubing. Behind the blocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran another series of tubes that vanished into another</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber toward the rear of the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Each one of these explosive blocks or units is cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able of producing 10,000 horsepower," Madden re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked, continuing his interesting explanations: "These</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders contain fuel for immediate discharge into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the units. The powder is ignited within the blocks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With no other outlet than the tubes behind them, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">FLIGHT OF THE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">power thus created is forced through the interior ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausts. Carbon and other elements, left uncombined</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the gases after they are first ignited, are in turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced into a series of exploding chambers, similar to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first blocks, where they are discharged with ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rific force. The power thus derived, wasting not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single atom of any portion of the original fuel, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">using even the neutral gases, is exerted through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exterior driving exhausts, causing a backward pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">which forces the ship forward at a terrific velocity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Using a catalyte of perellvum, our fuel is utilized</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the addition of oxygen extracted from the atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere. The real novelty of this ship's propulsion prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciples, Mr. Rodman, is these explosive gases; the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">features are secondary, because they follow the well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known principles of rocket propulsion. Other fuel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">producing equipment is contained in a forward chamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the air is treated with the small quantities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pcrellium necessary. The amazing feature of pereltium</seg><seg type="columnLine">is that, each time it is ignited, it forms a new explosive</seg><seg type="columnLine">compound of lesser, but still great power. Thus, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can get almost an infinite number of explosions with</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost unlimited power. As it is, the power we get</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a unit quantity is many times greater than any</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive heretofore known. The great difficulty is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to employ this great power to its full capacity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Eastern Star does not utilize it all; our mechanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus is not strong enough. The man who can</seg><seg type="columnLine">create a new principle for the discharge of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power contained in that fuel will earn for himself a</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater fortune than the scientist who discovered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">method of producing the gases."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Interesting, Mr. Madden," I said: "Very inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esting! But isn't there a possibility of this powder</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploding itself in the tanks ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Madden grinned good-naturedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nomore than gasoline in an automobile tank will</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignite itself, Mr. Rodman," he said: "Like gasoline,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our powdered fuel needs the high-voltage ignition spark</seg><seg type="columnLine">to discharge it. There is no possibility of such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">disaster."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I trust not," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me show you our electromagnetizing units, sir,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "They are really interesting to observe;</seg><seg type="columnLine">although most everything is housed up in tight com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partments. Did you know that the Eastern Star has a</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface covering entirely of cobalt-astralium-steel?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Cobalt-astralium-steel?" I asked: "What kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal is that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm only an officer of aviation, sir, not a scientist,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his answer, "but I'll try to explain the metal for</seg><seg type="columnLine">your benefit. As near as I can explain, cobalt-steel is</seg><seg type="columnLine">an alloy of metals, light and strong, adaptable to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">high degree of electromagnetism. Since it has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved that Einstein's theory of relativity is correct,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new alloy has been developed with the addition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">astralium, as the only known insulation against gravity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The metal, highly charged with electromagnetism, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great extent nullifies gravity. By that means the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eastern Star is capable of rising under practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">negligible power--only enough to overcome inertia.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In landing, all that is necessary is to diminish gradu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally the charge of electromagnetism and she will drift</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the level of the anchoring towers. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper level she is again insulated, and on top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing pylons are hidden electromagnets which attracts</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship to anchor safely and securely,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was awed at this tremendous advance of aviation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I had spent many hours in the air during my life, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">never in a craft of the Eastern Star's magnitude. She</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EASTERN STAR	505</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was seemingly, the ultimate--all that man could ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope for in flying. But I presume that, like those now</seg><seg type="columnLine">obsolete, her type will eventually step aside--as did</seg><seg type="columnLine">sail for steam and steam for electricity, like elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricity for gravitational nullification and so on until</seg><seg type="columnLine">man has worn himself back to the dust!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">To A Rescue</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I WAS about to press Madden for further details</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a siren alarm sounded in the room. Instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crew attending to their work in that section of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship stood tense, waiting for orders. Madden grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">me by the arm and hustled me out through the "battery"</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and up again into the passenger quarters. Hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riedly we made our way through the throngs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">loungers and strollers, and quickly entered the control</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">We rushed in to find Captain Markson bending over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a glowing screen. His face was twisted in a scowl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's up, sir?" Madden inquired at once. I stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the observation exposures and peered ahead. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky seemed overcast--it had grown thus in the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had spent below. I looked downward; far below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the billowing Pacific was hidden. The atmosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed in a turmoil beneath us; banks of vapor twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and writhed in dark, boiling masses. A terrific head</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind bucked the streamlined ship and clashed with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar against the exhaust pressure at her tail; every</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound was audible within the enclosed control room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the Eastern Star appeared to be standing perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">still in mid-air; but I knew that she was penetrating</seg><seg type="columnLine">the troubled skies at an unbelievable velocity. I shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">a questioning look at the captain and his first officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they stared into the luminous instrument. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard Captain Markson's muffled oath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are going to be held up again, Madden!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said bitterly. "We'll have to go to the assistance of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tramp ship at intersection 28-12-6. The fool let his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship run into a high waterspout and seems to be ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cash his chips. Well--we'll see what we can do about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it! Take a turn around the ship, Madden, and see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that every man is standing by. Mr. Rodman can re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">main here. I'll take the controls!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the first officer departed, I glanced at the instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment panels for a chance glimpse of our velocity and</seg><seg type="columnLine">altitude. The altimeter indicator hovered at 49,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet; the velocimeter indicated 500 miles per hour. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at it open-mouthed, incredulous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll be alongside of her in ten minutes," Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Markson said, taking the controls. "She's a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles to the south of us. We'll lose another twenty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, perhaps a half hour, if she hasn't cracked."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You mean you'll have to average six hundred miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">per hour, Captain ?" I asked, astonished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded as he touched a pedal on the floor with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his boot toe. Frozen vapor was now beating with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">loud clatter on the glass; the particles of ice snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the exposures with spiteful spats. The glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">within was frosting around the edges, visibly creeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the panel-centers forming a circle. The captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned suddenly toward the control operators.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Blunt!" he snapped: "Lift her to sixty-five thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand until we get over this storm! Gradually now!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly the Eastern Star's nose pointed skyward at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gentle angle. After a short while, during which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a tremendous weight pressing on me, Captain Mark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son twisted a small wheel in the center of a large con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol, and she floated again on an even keel. I glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the altimeter; in the space of not much more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute we had jumped upward from 49,000 to 65.000</seg><seg type="columnLine">506	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. The space below us seethed and writhed like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrous beast in agony. Captain Markson's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought my eyes to him; his face was stern and set.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wilson!" he shot abruptly: "Lift her another five</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand, and we'll be out of it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Already the frost began to creep away from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">closing circle; the cabin was getting warm and stuffy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I breathed deeply and stared ahead; I was forced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shield my eyes, however, from the terrible glare of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun which broke through upon us; its rays burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">even through the protecting shield of thick glass. Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain Markson pulled his visor down over his eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the pedal again. I felt the ship leap forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an arrow shot from a bow. The wind, even in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this rarefied atmosphere, shrieked a high-toned, singing</seg><seg type="columnLine">note in friction against the ship's snout.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The world seemed enveloped in a swirling mass, ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">writhing and twisting. Far ahead I could see below a</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater upheaval, that seemed like a great, cone-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">spinning top! It seemed to race straight toward us</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Captain Markson stubbornly nosed the Eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">Star down into it. The ship bounced and rolled under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the force of the atmospheric disturbance from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spout, while it was still miles away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Captain Markson swung away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls and walked swiftly to the ship's television</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold her course, men!" he growled: "Head her</seg><seg type="columnLine">right into the storm. We'll find the tramp somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pressed a series of buttons on a panel near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments and bellowed into a mouthpiece. No an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swer came. He swung the dials around and presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadows on the screen took shape. The haggard</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of a man appeared in it, and I heard his nervous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense voice coming through the speaker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For God's sake, can't I get some assistance?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried, eyes gleaming wide, nostrils dilated with emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion: "We can't last another fifteen minutes!

Our ship is No. 12 of the Iverson Freight</seg><seg type="columnLine">Line. We can't hold together much longer in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather. Our laterals and ailerons are ripping!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Markson waited long enough to get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name of the ship, then yelled loudly into his instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ahoy. No. 12!" he shouted: "Do you get me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man's features appeared on the screen again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hear you!" he wheezed. Then his voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken with a fit of coughing: "Where are you?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hurry! The spout is lifting us beyond our capacity!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll be right under you in exactly four minutes, No.</seg><seg type="columnLine">12!" Captain Markson roared: "Get your engines run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning full speed ahead with the wind! I'll dive into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spout and break it!

"Cut the spout in two!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           Into the Spout!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">INSTANTLY the Eastern Star shot ahead at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward angle and buried her nose in the up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaval! The storm outside roared ominously and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, as though the ship had dived into the ocean, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">observation exposures were drenched with the deluge!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Tons of water smashed against her nose with such force</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the huge air leviathan groaned and shuddered, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she went on nevertheless. For several long, torturous</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds the deluge continued. The Eastern Star</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed, as it were, to be driving ahead in the depths</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ocean; then suddenly her nose swung out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spout. A slightly westering sun, gorgeous in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiant sky, appeared ahead, and the ship was free!</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were a series of resounding clashes like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumble of water on a rocky beach. I looked at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spout again, as the Eastern Star nosed into the sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light; it seemed to have been cut in twain, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling rapidly in tremendous sheets of broken, tumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">water and mist. High above, where the spout had</seg><seg type="columnLine">raged unchecked, floated No. 12 like a huge sausage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She appeared to buckle in her center portions. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabilizing laterals had been torn away, and she pitched</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rolled from side to side, drunkenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost immediately the Eastern Star swung around</seg><seg type="columnLine">and headed for the helpless freighter. That No. 12</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beginning to settle slowly into a gradual plunge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was easy to see. Despite the fact that her motors still</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared in perfect rhythm, she made no headway. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">screws appeared to have lost their power to pull, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they managed still to keep her aloft and from rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">over entirely and plunging plummet-like to the depths</seg><seg type="columnLine">below 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As she neared the wreck, the Eastern Star slowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceptibly. Captain Markson raced toward the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posures and regarded her with disgust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a damn shame that men have to navigate junk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaps like that!" he said, clicking his teeth: "There</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to be a law to prevent such obsolete craft from</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking the air. They are a menace!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mindful of the danger of No. 12's possible plunge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Markson refused to permit his command to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get too close to her. I began to wonder how he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to rescue the wrecked ship's crew. But I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon to learn, for Captain Markson returned to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">television instruments and turned on the power. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dials were already adjusted to the broadcasting wave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of No. 12, and the screen glowed at once with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the haggard features of her skipper. Captain Markson</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarded him for an instant and then spoke roughly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Can you manage to get into port, No. 12?" he asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I doubt it, sir!" the man wheezed, still coughing:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She's settling forward now, and she's likely to plunge</seg><seg type="columnLine">at any moment! Can you take on my crew ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right!" Captain Markson returned, scowling:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll do it! We'll spread nets on our hull top, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay-to right under you in one minute! I'll take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance with my own passengers for humanity's sake!</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Chute your men through the safety tube and I'll catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em in the nets. Hurry!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The skipped yelled an unintelligible something, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screen died. Captain Markson grabbed a telephone</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yelled into it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Raise the rescue nets!" he bellowed: "And stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">by for further orders!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hissed an order to the pilots; the Eastern Star</seg><seg type="columnLine">edged into position under the rolling freighter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted presently, laid-to. I glanced upward. Almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once I saw a long string of rapidly falling dots.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the nearest had his plunge checked, as a gos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">samer-white balloon of silk opened; then another</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulged, and another. The crew was on its way down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward. I wondered if they would land safely on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad hull of the Eastern Star. There appeared to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">no wind now, and they floated lightly straight down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I glanced warmly at Captain Markson. His face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">FLIGHT OF THE EASTERN STAR	507</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tense, and he plainly chafed at the delay in getting all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crew off as he watched every single movement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the apparently drunken craft above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently a bell sounded: Captain Markson picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a receiver and held it to his ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good!" he said. "Bring the men down at once.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What? One man went over the side? Sorry! Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">No. 12's skipper with them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I heard a faint voice coming through the tube. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was muffled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!" the voice said: "He refuses to leave his ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She's carrying a valuable cargo and he won't desert it!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Markson swore under his breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Send the men down!" he shouted, "and stand by</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the hull until I talk to the skipper!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He swung to his instruments. The screen glowed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealing the objects in the television room of the wreck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Markson pressed a button; I heard the signal as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrated furiously in the other ship. But no answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back and Captain Markson picked up the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone again and ordered the rescuers into the ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The captain was spending precious moments trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get a word to the skipper of the lost ship, while No. 12</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pitching madly and threatened to drop down upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">us at any moment. I myself was getting extremely</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous, as I watched each sickening plunge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. Then, suddenly the reproducing units of the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision instruments crackled. I glanced at the screen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The freighter's commander had reappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you for saving my men, sir!" he was saying:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I can not leave--I'll face the music. Better get out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from under at once! She won't stay up another</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't be a fool, captain!" Captain Markson growled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"To hell with that notion! Drop down now and we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick you up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sorry, sir!" the man said, a peculiar tone in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice: "I go down with my ship!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Markson stamped a foot on the floor in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm asking you to drop down now, skipper!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared: "I'll give you two seconds to decide. If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">refuse, then be damned to you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pick up my cargo," the man argued, "and I'll go</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go to hell!" Captain Markson swore: "I've got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make Tokio on time! I have the mails, and I'm ninety</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes late now! Are you coming down ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scarcely had Captain Markson finished his sentence</seg><seg type="columnLine">than No. 12 suddenly shuddered. Three of her whirl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing screws stopped dead. She tilted her nose upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an instant and made a sickening half-roll over. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Markson was not to be caught napping in such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dangerous position. He bellowed an order and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eastern Star came to life; with a terrific recoil she</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot ahead as No. 12 plunged downward. I heard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">series of rapid-fire explosions; the wrecked ship's hull</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to open up suddenly and spew boxes, bales and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism. A fragment clattered against the steel hull</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Eastern Star; it sent a ringing echo reverberat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through the ship. The Eastern Star roared ahead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly gaining velocity. Captain Markson stood staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the screen. I walked to his side. The screen re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed the tramp's skipper again; his face wore a mask</seg><seg type="columnLine">of death, his lips drawn tight and bloodless across his</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you ask if I was coming down, sir?" he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a trace of humor which manifested itself in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of inevitable death. I admired him for it. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed was a brave man--a man who could laugh and,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">jest with the hand of death grasping at his throat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, Captain," he continued: "I don't know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">far I've come, but I went down a hell of a way!" Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he laughed loudly, almost hysterically, I thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You had your chance, skipper!" Captain Markson</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, coldly. I stared at him curiously. Though his</seg><seg type="columnLine">words were cold and gruff, his face disclosed both ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miration and sorrow for this man who was plunging</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his death: "But after all, I guess you're right!</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's no getting away from tradition! A man's got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go with his vessel, no matter whether it's an airship</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a lumbering water packet! God be merciful to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The perishing captain laughed maniacally, and waved</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hand as the screen sputtered and died. I walked away</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a deep feeling of regret, and glanced downward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Far below No. 12 plunged like a plummet. Presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">I beheld a small round patch of white; she had struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the billowing waves of the Pacific. A moment later I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a muffled splash. That was all!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poor devil!" Captain Markson remarked, shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head. The Eastern Star roared westward toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tokio, her first scheduled stop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Far off our port scudded a huge airliner. I watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">her with growing interest. The insignia, barely visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the distance, told that she was of our own line, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">International Airway Express; her driving exhausts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like our own, were spouting blue flame. The sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">smote her abeam and she glistened like a thing of virgin</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold. Then she dropped from view into the east.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Despite the late hour when we arrived, the air over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tokio was crammed with the quaint but speedy air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft typical of the Orient. The Eastern Star came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a graceful landing at an anchoring tower, chaper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oned by a half-hundred droning planes, their sirens</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieking a welcome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Tokio was enjoying one of its annual air carnivals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staged until the late hours of the evening. Craft be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">decked with genuine and painted flowers raced through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air with rollicking abandon; yet they remained at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a safe distance away from the regular air lanes. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched them, fascinated, as they cavorted hither and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yon, lighted brilliantly from batteries of high-powered</seg><seg type="columnLine">floodlights spread on the ground below. Ikamono</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wrens, Hirashimoto Gulls, the more cumbersome Cho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chang metal blimps, and many other types of craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">dotted the skies, piloted by care-free revelers. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an open season for American tourists; and our pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">senger list boasted of many Middle-Western school</seg><seg type="columnLine">teachers, bent on seeing pleasure-loving Japan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I too felt an urge to desert the Eastern Star here at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this delightful time, to enjoy the carefree carnival from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a comfortable roof-top apartment in the American</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quarter. For, after all, I had three weeks in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">to enjoy my flight around the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it was with delight and anticipation that I or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered my luggage 'chuted to the landing.

I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain in Tokio for three days; then board once again</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great liner, and continue my flight around the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sought out Captain Markson and First Officer Mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den and bade them good-bye.

It, therefore, fell to Richard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herrick to be both father and mother to the youthful</seg><seg type="columnLine">orphan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> _ "Uncle Dick," as Herrick was called by young Man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning, proved to be a very efficient guardian, and under</seg><seg type="columnLine">such tutelage, by the time the youth had reached twenty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was not only an athlete of distinction but, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt, one of the most promising young scientists in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the United States. During the mornings Herrick and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his protege were to be seen working industriously in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laboratory or workshop; but after lunch all scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tific apparatus would be laid away, and the afternoons</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent in hunting, fishing, flying, or strenuous sports.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After Manning had reached man's estate, and ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired a coveted position as technical advisor for a cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain large aircraft corporation, a change came gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the once jolly Herrick. He became moody and</seg><seg type="columnLine">irritable. More of his time was spent in the laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, what was worst of all, he and young Manning</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to disagree on certain matters of science. Grad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually the gap widened between the two, who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost like father and son. At last Herrick, to avert</seg><seg type="columnLine">an open break, moved to the West coast; some time</seg><seg type="columnLine">later Manning received from him a letter saying that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was engaged in work that would carry him all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Orient. From then on they corresponded in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">desultory way, and young Manning received occasional</seg><seg type="columnLine">letters from China, India, Java, and many other places.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick Manning was just twenty-three when the Phan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom appeared. The newspapers announced with blazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">headlines that the great air-liner Mammoth had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">captured and plundered by an unknown craft. A long</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispatch followed, which told in detail how the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">airship had been held up by a strange black ship and</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbed of well over a million dollars in gold. Although</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">crime in the air was not absolutely unknown, never</seg><seg type="columnLine">before had a fast ship like the Mammoth been attacked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Because the pirate became invisible at a short distance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was given the name, the Phantom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one on board the Mammoth seemed to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">much about the robbery, it had happened so quickly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Men in black cloaks, with black hoods over their heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">and faces, had found their way down from the top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship, held up the purser, forced the strong room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried out the treasure, and bore it aloft. Just as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm was given the pilot saw a dim shape race away</seg><seg type="columnLine">and vanish into the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The papers accepted the incident as the usual part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day's news until, only a few days later, another air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liner was attacked; and this time the victims were sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunging into the sea. Then followed a reign of terror;</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface ships were blown up; cities were bombed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">airships were sent to destruction; always at night, by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">black airship which afterward faded away almost in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly into the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The world was aroused; the United States dispatched</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten of the fastest military planes in existence with</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders to bring down the pirate ship. At last the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuers succeeded in getting on the trail and chasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Phantom for many miles; but its speed was so great</seg><seg type="columnLine">that each time it eluded them. The ship would remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">just out of gunshot and, when the high-powered motors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pursuers began to labor under the strain of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, the Phantom steadily drew away and left them</seg><seg type="columnLine">"holding the bag."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some days later the government planes, flying over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Arizona desert, came upon the Phantom lying, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge dragon of old, upon the sand. One of the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">later described it as l&gt;eing "just a long black shell, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a point in front like a dagger, and fins at the lack."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The aviators dropped bombs; which strangely failed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst. Then, the planes' motors became suddenly para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lyzed ; and those mighty machines seemed to be clawed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the sky, as easily as a kitten claws a ball of yarn</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a chair. Only two men escaped death, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed almost insane as they told their story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It isn't natural!" one screamed, like a man de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented: "I tell you the devil himself is behind it all!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can see the thing, still, lying there on the burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand, dead and lifeless, like a huge black torpedo. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt a slight shock pass through my body and, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next thing I knew, our motors were dead and we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">heading for the ground."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A slight break occurred in the man's story at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">point, and he shivered as with the ague:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As I crawled out from the wreckage of our plane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there the thing was, hanging suspended about fifty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air and making a whistling sound. While I</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched, it shot away like a bullet, with a low hissing</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise, and disappeared behind the range."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herrick's Return</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHILE the reign of terror lasted, only one man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the opportunity to view the Phantom at close</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters and lived to tell the tale. A certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">young inventor was trying out an electric airplane one</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening about dusk. His plane was working; but not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his satisfaction. He was contemplating the necessity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing, before his batteries went dead; when out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the West came a black shape! Suddenly, a bright light</seg><seg type="columnLine">shone on him; the thing hovered over his head, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw for a moment a long cigar-shaped craft, sharply</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PHANTOM OF GALON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">511</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed at the bow and having huge fins atttached to</seg><seg type="columnLine">its stern. At first glance, the thing seemed to be made of</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel plates riveted together and painted black. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">various points along the sides were crystal-covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">ports, through one of which shone the brilliant light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment the apparition, hissing like a python,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hovered above the terror-stricken young man; then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a slight shock pass through him, and the thing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone into the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One thing only the world had learned by this inci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent; that the terrible power which the Phantom ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ercised to paralyze combustion engines had no effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon electric motors. Undoubtedly, the shock experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enced by the inventor was the same as that which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been described by the army aviators.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was much conjecturing as to where this strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft came from. Some said from the Arizona desert,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some suggested from far-away Mongolia; and a syndi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate writer with a fertile imagination even went so far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to hint that the Phantom hailed from the moon or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars. One paper intimated the possibility that anyone's</seg><seg type="columnLine">best friend might be the contriver of the Phantom and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a result, old friends became suspicious of each other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For six long months the reign of terror continued.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The governments of the world became desperate; and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">king's ransom was offered to the man who should give</seg><seg type="columnLine">information leading to discovery of the Phantom's</seg><seg type="columnLine">headquarters. Scientists worked day and night trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find some means to cope with the menace. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain that directs this diabolical machine," said one</seg><seg type="columnLine">prominent physicist, "has ideas a hundred years ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the times." It was all too true; a master mind was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being matched against the aviators of the time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, after six months of repeated outrages, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reign of terror ended; and the Phantom was not heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of for more than a year. The world breathed a sigh</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went more cheerfully about its affairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While the Phantom was following its career of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanton depredation, Richard Manning had been very</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy working out an idea which his father, at the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his death, had in the process of development. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the papers each day announced some new atro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">city committed by that terrible ship, Manning gave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Phantom little thought and spent most of his time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laboratory. Certain of his friends were wont to</seg><seg type="columnLine">criticize his attitude toward the Phantom, and ask him</seg><seg type="columnLine">why he did not aid with his science to find a means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">combating the terrible curse which had settled upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. He took these sallies good naturedly, and usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">would say laughingly that, when he had perfected his</seg><seg type="columnLine">new machine, the days of the "Phantom" would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbered. But, before the new Manning invention</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be perfected, the Phantom had disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the year of quiet which followed the reign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of terror, Dick Manning worked hard and succeeded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">completing his invention. It was with a feeling of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentment that he awaited the arrival of Richard Her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rick, whom he had not seen for over two years, but who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now stopping off on his way to Europe to pay his</seg><seg type="columnLine">protege a visit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was on the first evening, after dinner, that Herrick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who seemed to be again in high spirits, said to Man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning^</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Richard, my boy, what is this new electrostatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor of yours that you mentioned in your letters? Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">it really practical?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You bet it is!" replied the youth with enthusiasm:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why, when I finish it. the Phantom--if he still exists</seg><seg type="columnLine">--may as well give up the ghost."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," chuckled Herrick after a time: "it must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a whole lot better than some so-called electrostatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">motors which I have seen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, Uncle Dick," went on young Manning ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iously: "I know that the idea of utilizing static elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricity as a means of motive power was long ago</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandoned by most scientists; but there was one who did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not lightly cast the idea aside, and that was my father.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found among his personal papers, soon after you went</seg><seg type="columnLine">West, a set of drawings which outlined a scheme for</seg><seg type="columnLine">making the utilization of static electricity really prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticable. With these plans as a guide, I have at last suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded in producing what I call a static supercharger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as an electrostatic motor which runs with great</seg><seg type="columnLine">efficiency on the power furnished by the supercharger."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Young Manning then proceeded to outline to Her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rick just how the supercharger and motor worked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is no reason for boring the reader with a de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tailed scientific discussion of the machine, but perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few words should be said about its nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The atmosphere at all times contains a certain amount</seg><seg type="columnLine">of static electricity; sometimes its concentration reaches</seg><seg type="columnLine">a high value, and at other times there is very little.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lightning, for instance, is a discharge of static elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricity, cither between two clouds or between a cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the earth. To understand why static electricity has</seg><seg type="columnLine">never been brought into use, the reader must bear in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind that (in terms of electricity) "volts" means elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trical pressures and "amperes" means current-flow. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">high-school laboratories there are electrostatic machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">which discharge sparks of four and five thousand volts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These discharges, have, however, practically negligible</seg><seg type="columnLine">amperage and have little energy value. They may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken through the body without endangering life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Richard Manning with his new static machine threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new light on the subject. Briefly, his invention con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted of an instrument that drew static in enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">quantities from the atmosphere. By means of coils,</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemical rectifiers and other strange devices, the charges</seg><seg type="columnLine">of high-voltage static were converted into current of</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable amperage which operated a specially de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed motor of super-efficiency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Girl</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EVEN Herrick, hardened old scientist that he was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed astonishment when he saw evidence of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific power from the atmosphere made available by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange machine; during the rest of his stay he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed at times, to be deep in profound meditation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All of this Manning noticed perfunctorily; but, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, he gave it little thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the day came for Herrick to continue his</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey to Europe. In contrast with his previous mood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was in excellent humor that morning at breakfast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say, Richard," he said, stirring his coffee, "Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't you let your work ride for a while, and go with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to Europe? The change will do you good, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be back in a couple of weeks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment Manning pondered, then he said:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"By George! Uncle Dick, that's an idea. I believe I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will." And so, when the air-liner Ambassador rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her gigantic landing stage in New York, Herrick</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Manning were among those on board.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nine hours exactly was the time required by the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">liners to fly from New York to Paris. They left New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York usually at six o'clock in the evening, New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">time: and arrived in Paris at eight the next morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paris time. The Ambassador was one of the largest on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the line and, during its two years of service, not once</seg><seg type="columnLine">512	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had it failed to arrive at its destination on time. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the worst of storms had marred its splendid</seg><seg type="columnLine">record.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the early evening Richard enjoyed the flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">immensely. For some minutes he amused himself by</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking down through the windows of an observation</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck upon the waves of the great Atlantic. From time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to time surface ships--mere toys they looked from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">height--slid past and soon disappeared into the west.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last, when he had tired of looking at the sea, he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the news room, read the latest bulletins, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">retired to his stateroom to dress. He had seen but little</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Herrick, who was now very busy, sending radiograms</seg><seg type="columnLine">attending to matters which he had neglected during his</seg><seg type="columnLine">short stay at Manning's home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When twelve o'clock came, however (they had set</seg><seg type="columnLine">their watches at once five hours ahead to Paris time)</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uncle Dick joined Manning, and they went into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly-lighted dining-room. It was well filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">diners in evening attire and, above the buzz of conver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sation, could be heard the strains of an orchestra. At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentive waiters, garbed in spotless white, glided with</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily-laden trays to and from the kitchen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Richard Herrick Manning was just in the act</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cutting a particularly juicy piece of filet mignon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smothered in onions, when a delicate aroma of violets</seg><seg type="columnLine">assailed his nostrils and the steward swept by with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stylishly dressed young lady, of possibly twenty-two</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, in tow. He found the girl a seat at a nearby</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, facing Manning. That gentleman, forgetting</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself for an instant, ceased cutting the steak to stare</seg><seg type="columnLine">after her. As she seated herself, she gave him a cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance, and, very much embarrassed, he fell to eating</seg><seg type="columnLine">industriously. When he again plucked up courage</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to glance furtively in her direction, the smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her face reassured him that she was not altogether</seg><seg type="columnLine">displeased by his admiration. He colored, but managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to smile back. As he later said to Herrick: "She is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without doubt, the most beautiful girl I have ever seen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uncle Dick. Her eyes, her hair, her lips, are perfect."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rot, Richard! perfect rot!" Herrick had scoffed:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"who ever heard of a cold-blooded scientist falling in</seg><seg type="columnLine">love at first sight? Why, boy, the idea is preposterous 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Richard, however, was not so sure. After dinner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he was reading in the library, a breath of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft perfume came to him again; and he looked up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just in time to see Her disappear through a door into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the salon. But, glory! There on the floor in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him lay a bit of lace and chiffon. Like a shot, he was out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his chair and after the fair one who had let it fall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amid the groups in the salon, he picked his way and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last caught up with his goddess, just as she was entering</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ballroom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pardon me," he said, holding up the little handker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief, "but did you not drop this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh how careless of me!" she exclaimed, in what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Richard thought an extraordinarily pleasing voice:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thank you, ever so much." There was an awkward</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause; and then the orchestra struck up a lively tune.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He spurred his courage--"May I have this dance?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked boldly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why!"--she hesitated, and capitulated--"I guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next moment she was in his arms and they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling over the jxilished floor. Richard Herrick, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood idly watching the dancers, had seen them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Humph!" he snorted, and strolled back into the salon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Richard Manning did not see him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that moment he was incapable of seeing anything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg><seg type="columnLine">The "Phantom" Returns</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR one who was unfamiliar with the wiles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">women, Richard progressed famously. He learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the youthful beauty's name was Margaret</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huntington, and that her journey to Paris was in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">to join her father, Professor R. L. Huntington, whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">Richard knew well as one of the world's greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">physicists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon learning her father's name, he immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressed his interest, an actual one, in the theory which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Huntington had most recently advanced; but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in reality, his principal interest at that moment was</seg><seg type="columnLine">centered on the daughter. No one, however, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">blame him; for, with her auburn hair, her cool eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her clear creamy skin,faintly tinged with pink, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was indeed beautiful. Perhaps, though, the interest was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not all one-sided; for the clear-eyed, tanned young</seg><seg type="columnLine">athlete had, unknown to himself, often made many a</seg><seg type="columnLine">young lady's heart flutter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although Richard never dreamed of it at the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, it was not altogether strange that the innocent</seg><seg type="columnLine">little bit of lace and chiffon should have managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop directly in front of his chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For more than an hour the young couple alternately</seg><seg type="columnLine">danced and chatted upon the cosy after-deck into which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ballroom opened, where couples sat out the inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">missions. It seemed, already, that they had been life-</seg><seg type="columnLine">long friends. But the rapid course of the giant air-Iiner</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the east was causing time to redouble its pace. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour was still late at New York; but it was far into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the early morning at Paris. Up there, far to the north</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Atlantic, day was rushing to meet them; in less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than an hour it would dawn. The orchestra ceased; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights in the ballroom were turned down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh!" exclaimed the girl rising hurriedly, "who</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have thought it is so late?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed as though Richard held her hand a trifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer than was necessary, as he bade her good-night;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but, if he did, she seemed not to mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time after the lights had been dimmed, Richard</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood at the observation window, looking downwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">and back, and listened to the steady drone of the motors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Once, a brightly-lighted steamer passed below and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed a huge searchlight upward; but it soon faded</seg><seg type="columnLine">from sight and only a faint glow from its rear lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">was left to soften the pitchy blackness of the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">At last the captain of the huge air-liner--a jolly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">likeable sort of a chap--came out on the rear deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He greeted Richard, whom he knew well, and the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">chatted about various things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say!" remarked the captain, suddenly pointing</seg><seg type="columnLine">astern, "what does that look like to you ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Richard looked and managed to make out a tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">pin-prick of light which seemed to be moving rapidly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It looks like a shooting-star to me," he replied, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it must be some other ship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hm-m," mused the captain: "Yes, it looks like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting-star; but it moves a little too slow and lasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">too long. On the other hand, it moves too fast for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary ship. There's not a ship built that can over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haul the Ambassador when she is moving so near her</seg><seg type="columnLine">maximum speed, as we are now. It might be a scouting</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane, but it doesn't appear like one. Yes, that light is</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily growing brighter." It was true. As they</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched, the light had steadily become larger and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant.	o</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PHANTOM OF GALON	513</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''It's no ordinary ship," said the captain. A touch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimness edged his tone: "It must be that damned</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Flyin' Dutchman' of the air, the Phantom."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Phantom?" echoed Richard in a whisper, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt the hair raise on the nape of his neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must get up forward and take charge of things!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed the captain, showing some agitation, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed along the darkened corridors toward the control</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin. Like one in a daze, Richard stumbled after him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at length came into a small, dimly-lighted room</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the captain was already giving orders to several</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his officers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Haltal" rang a cold voice, with a slight foreign</seg><seg type="columnLine">accent, from the radiophone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Full speed ahead 1" bellowed the captain. The huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">motors took on a new tone as the speed was increased.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly, without warning, the fifteen mighty motors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which propelled the ship, ceased to roar; they seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stutter a moment, and then stopped with a wheezing</seg><seg type="columnLine">cough. A silence that could almost have been cut with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a knife settled over the huge monster of the air. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fraction of a second, every man in the control room</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood aghast. The young wheelsman was the first to</seg><seg type="columnLine">break the silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God I" he cried in panic; "We've gone dead!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep cool everyone!" yelled the captain, "and start</seg><seg type="columnLine">the auxiliaries!" An instant later the four electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">motors on top of the ship whirred, and their descent</seg><seg type="columnLine">was slowly checked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Every man to his post!" ordered the captain, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">be prepared for anything."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can I be of any assistance?" asked Manning, step-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain then pulled from his pocket a beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic electric pistol and pressed it into Manning's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. "Climb up here to the top of the ship and plug</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first pirate that tries to get down here," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned to continue giving his orders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A narrow spiral staircase extended from the control</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, through a tube, to the upper surface of the ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Up this steep helical stairway, the gun gleaming in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, climbed Richard Manning, passing at regular</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervals the small doors which gave access to the dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent corridors in the ship. As he reached one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these, he heard a stifled scream in the corridor on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other side. Waiting to hear no more, he yanked open</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tiny door and found himself looking down a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall, which he might have recognized as the one on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which his own stateroom was located.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gave that fact no thought; for there, not five</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards away, was Margaret Huntington, the girl of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lace handkerchief, struggling in the gray) of a black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloaked and hooded figure! As the door came open, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinister invader straightened and looked up. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment Manning saw two slits cut in the hood and</seg><seg type="columnLine">through them felt that two coals of fire were shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him. Then the masked man turned and fled down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop!" yelled Manning and, raising the automatic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired. The figure dodged into a stateroom as the electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet exploded into flame against the manolcum door</seg><seg type="columnLine">frame. The flash died out instantly, and the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">slammed heavily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you all right, Margaret?" Manning anxiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked, as he gently raised the girl from the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I guess so," she replied weakly, "but oh, Dick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm afraid!"--and she relaxed into his arms. As Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">Manning felt that beautiful creature huddle closer</seg><seg type="columnLine">against him, a strange exuberance swelled in h^heart</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and he crushed her to him and smothered her with</seg><seg type="columnLine">kisses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I love you, Margaret," he whispered, "I'm crazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">about you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I love you too, Dick," she replied, gently pushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him away and rearranging her hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's all the rumpus?" demanded a bald-headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">old gentleman appearing in pajamas: "I heard a shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I open my door to find some fresh whippersnapper</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a boy making love.

It was with some surprise that Man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning now noted that the room was his own 1 There, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side opposite the door, a yawning porthole told very</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly how the "Phantom" had escaped. A small ladder</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran past the porthole from a gondola, several yards be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, up to the topmost platform of the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next to Manning's stateroom was that of Herrick;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two rooms were linked up by a small bathroom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Manning stepped to Herrick's door and jerked it open.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herrick, rubbing the sleep from his eyes, sat up in bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What in the devil is the idea of waking a man at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time of night?" he grumbled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's the Phantom!" exclaimed Manning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The what?" questioned Herrick, "suddenly aroused</seg><seg type="columnLine">to interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The conversation was interrupted by a loud crack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling noise which seemed to come from above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good heavens! what's that?" exclaimed Herrick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking toward the porthole. Manning dashed to it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked out, but he saw nothing. Instantly he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided to crawl through that of his own room and climb</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the ladder to the top of the ship. In spite of the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the ports on the Ambassador were somewhat larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">than those on surface ships, it was with considerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty that Richard managed to squeeze through.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Gee!" he thought to himself, "that 'Phantom' fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be a sure-enough phantom, to crawl through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole like this." At last, however, he succeeded, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clung to the tiny ladder with the cool night breeze fan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning his brow. High above him on the roof of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">liner he could still hear that intermittent crackling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Far below him, somewhere in that black void, lay the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim Atlantic, waiting to swallow him up should he</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a misstep. A shudder passed through him as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of the sea over a mile below him; but he steeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his courage and started climbing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For what seemed an age, he climbed, and gradually,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the top was neared, his path curved to the horizontal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last, he came to a position which enabled him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">view the extreme top. Some distance down the length</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ship, to his left, was a beam of light streaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">out through a manhole. Slightly to the right of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manhole he could make out a dim black form, around</seg><seg type="columnLine">which snapped and popped electrical discharges; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, he judged, was not over a twentieth the size of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ambassador. The intermittent electrical discharges</seg><seg type="columnLine">shed a ghastly light over the larger ship, and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow he could see two of the whirring propellers that</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept the great air-liner moving aloft. Not a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">light shone from the Phantom, as he judged it to be,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except for the electrical fireworks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">514	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly as it had begun, the electrical display ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">and left only the whine of the auxiliary motors to break</seg><seg type="columnLine">the silence. Then Manning saw a light appear near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">base of the shadowy ship and, in its glow, he was able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make out several persons. A tiny spark bobbed along</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the lighted manhole in the top of the Am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bassador. Then, to Richard's surprise, there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">metallic sound, followed by a blood-curdling scream;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sparks flew off into space and the screaming grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">fainter and fainter as the victim followed the tiny light</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, down into the unfathomable depths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For an instant Manning, frozen with horror, clung</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ladder and wondered how it felt to be struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a propeller rotating at high speed, and hurled off</seg><seg type="columnLine">into an abyss. He was brought to his senses by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattle of a machine gun, which was cutting a red streak</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the darkness at the edge of the manhole toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light that shone from the Phantom; the officers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the liner were firing on the pirates. Manning raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun, aimed also toward the light, and pressed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trigger; its electrical missiles flashed among the shadowy</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures. The new element entering into the conflict</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently frightened the Phantom's crew; for the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out, a loud hissing arose, and Manning saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge dark shapy shoot away into the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the rest of the night, to most of the passengers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the liner, sleep was out of the question. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one man, however, who returned to his berth as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing had happened, and that was Herrick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Uncle Dick has nerves of steel," his nephew re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked: "I really believe if the ship were on fire he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would grumble about being disturbed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every one on board was anxious to hear Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huntington's story of the attack, and how it had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened.

Then I heard a loud hissing noise, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to come from outside the ship. I sat up in bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was terrified to see a terrible, ugly face peering at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me through the porthole. I screamed, jumped out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed, and rushed into the hall, only to be caught by that</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful figure in black. If Mr. Manning hadn't arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the scene, I dread to think of what would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">become of me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course the whole world was stirred up over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reappearance of the Phantom, and the world's govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments renewed their efforts to run down that terror of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air; but, as before, all their activities ended in</seg><seg type="columnLine">failure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           The Abduction</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DURING the two weeks Manning spent in Europe;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw a great deal of Margaret Huntington,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl of the auburn hair. He also met and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a great liking to the blunt, grizzled old man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was her father. The magnetic personality of the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist and inventor had its effect in turn upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flinty nature of the physicist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Young Manning is a person," he told a friend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"who will get ahead in this world.

I should be glad to give the dear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est thing I possess to such a fine young man." Such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long discourse from Dr. Huntington was extra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary, to say the least; but it showed the high esteem</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which he held Richard Manning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Herrick had completed his business in Europe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he and Manning returned to America; and with them</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned Margaret Huntington and her father. Her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rick was disgusted at Manning's affair with Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huntington, and did not endeavor in any way to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guise his feelings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Love wasn't made for scientists," he grumbled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Who ever heard of a scientist that amounted to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">damn after he got married?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How about R.

Manning gleefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Herrick growled something about "feather-brained</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth," and allowed the subject to drop for the time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Richard pursued his wooing unhampered. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposed, and was accepted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, the evening of the wedding arrived. Herrick</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never been fully reconciled to his former ward's</seg><seg type="columnLine">infatuation; but the night of the wedding found him</seg><seg type="columnLine">on hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guests had all arrived and everything was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order. Young Manning, who should have been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">happiest man in America, was plainly nervous; while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herrick was in strangely good humor. He laughed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">joked with almost everyone present, seeming the gayest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the guests. This mood struck Manning as being</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather mercurial; because, just an hour before, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinner, Herrick had told him very plainly that he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet approve of the match--why, he did not say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't figure out Uncle Dick these days," Manning</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked to Dr. Huntington: "sometimes he acts like</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself and then, at other times, he seems to be some</seg><seg type="columnLine">other person."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't try to understand, my boy," said Huntington,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dryly: "all of us old codgers get that way as we work</seg><seg type="columnLine">up toward our second childhood."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Richard laughed and dismissed the matter from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The time for the ceremony arrived, but the bride</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not descend. Fifteen minutes dragged by, and still</seg><seg type="columnLine">no Margaret. Finally, Dr. Huntington started upstairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see what was detaining her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's probably still primping, or weeping, or doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">some other fool thing," he growled as he strode off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment he reappeared at the top of the stairs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His face was ashy--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's gone!'' he cried frantically, and waved a yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrap of paper in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a flash Manning was up the stairs. The condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of Margaret's boudoir told plainer than words</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had happened.

Of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Manning doubted that the Phantom could really ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terminate the human race; but he knew that the monster</seg><seg type="columnLine">could play havoc with civilization. This was why he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitated to seek vengeance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, though, he could endure his inaction no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer; he made up his mind that the Phantom must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be removed once and forever from the face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. But how was he to accomplish this? How was</seg><seg type="columnLine">he to make a machine capable of attaining a speed equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">to that of the pirate ship? And then, to find the lurk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing place of the Phantom?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sent for Herrick; but received word that the latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ventured into a remote part of Asia to seek some</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of mineral deposits. He next turned for aid to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Margaret's father, Dr. Huntington, and was shocked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn that the old physicist had suffered a complete lapse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of memory, and was undergoing treatment in a Paris</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanitorium. If Manning had read the newspapers in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meantime, he would have known that under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock of losing his daughter, Huntington's great mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been jerked from its moorings and thrown into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">state bordering on chaos.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So of the three great scientists, Richard Manning</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the one upon whose shoulders rested the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty of running the Phantom to earth. But the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">question that confronted him was, how to go about</seg><seg type="columnLine">building the proper ship? He knew that with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrostatic motor terrific power was available; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">to attain a speed of five or six hundred miles an hour,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even with unlimited power, was no small task. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, his estimate of five hundred miles was just a</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess at the speed of the Phantom; it might be that</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it might be five thousand. At the time, he decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make his goal six hundred miles an hour, almost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">twice the speed of the average flier. But, after a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal of figuring, the main question still loomed: how</seg><seg type="columnLine">could he do it ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For hours he pondered that question; then, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out to exercise in the park, the solution was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed to him by a small boy. The little fellow had in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand a large rubber balloon which he would inflate</seg><seg type="columnLine">to capacity, then deflate by releasing his finger from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end and allowing the air to rush out. At one time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the balloon was full with air, the child accidentally</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned it loose. Manning, who was idly watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">actions of the little fellow, saw the balloon shoot high</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the air and fall several yards away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What a dumbbell I am 1" he exclaimed aloud: "Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have thought of the rocket principle before now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With this in mind, he designed the strange craft in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he hoped to catch the "Flying Dutchman" of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. The same aircraft corporation that had built the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mercury, Robert Manning's first ship, constructed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Skyrocket, the masterpiece of Richard Manning. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">designed on a principle which, in the '30s, had shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">great promise; but had then been side-tracked and for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten, because of the difficulty of obtaining the enor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous power required.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under the personal direction of Manning, the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane grew rapidly and, with an army of workmen at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his disposal, in comparatively short time he had it com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted. What a beauty it was to be; graceful as a gazelle</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet sturdy as an elephant, incorporating a radical change</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the now usual type of combination dirigible and</seg><seg type="columnLine">airplane. All excess weight was eliminated, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body was built very slender, resembling more a needle</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a torpedo. All the protrudihg edges, such as those</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the planes and stabilizers, were stream-lined to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">exceedingly high degree. Through the center or core</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hull, from stem to stern, ran a large tube con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed of layer after layer of pure manoleum. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">this huge tube were located, and operated by means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrostatic motors, the gigantic fans which were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw in air at the nose and blow it out at the rear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Although this scheme necessitated an enormous expen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diture of energy. Manning believed that the centraliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of power and the double action of the fans would</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly increase the speed and efficiency of the machine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As shown in the model and, later, as shown in the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, this proved to be true.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One morning, when the new ship was almost finished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Manning received a radiogram which again nearly dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracted him. It read: "Richard Herrick was instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed this morning by an explosion." Unknown to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Manning, who had been so busily engaged, Herrick</seg><seg type="columnLine">had returned from Asia. While working in his labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory, Manning learned, something that Herrick was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixing had exploded; killing him instantly and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">figuring his face, especially, beyond recognition. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">Manning gazed upon the tom body of the older scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tist, he could hardly believe that it was indeed that of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who had been a second father to him; but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure of a dragon tattooed upon the right arm, above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the elbow, excluded all doubt of his identity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second tragedy, coming so close upon the first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">liad nearly the effect of sending Richard to join Hunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ington: but, somehow, his iron will dominated, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after Herrick had been laid in his last resting place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the younger scientist continued his work from the point</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it had been interrupted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the great plane, which he had determined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">name the Skyrocket, was in the last stage of comple-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, Richard began to gather around him a carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">516	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">selected crew to man the craft. Just by chance, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded in procuring, as his chief officer, the former</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain of the Ambassador, who had recently resigned</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the service of the lines. With such a man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge, he believed the chances of success in the hunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">were greatly increased. The other ten of the crew were</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean-limbed, brave young fellows--each of whom was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an expert pilot, and each of whom held a commission</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Air Reserves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day for testing the new ship arrived. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled from its cradle in the hangar and the motors</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuned up. Once again, as the marvelous structure lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">there glistening in the morning sunlight, each vital part</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gone over, the static supercharger was tested, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motors were adjusted, and the other mechanical parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were checked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last Manning gave the word to be off. The motors</seg><seg type="columnLine">hummed and, like a feather wafted aloft in a breeze,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Skyrocket sailed into the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Forward!" ordered Richard, when an altitude of</seg><seg type="columnLine">two thousand feet had been reached, and the ship, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hiss, leaped forward like the device for which it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">named.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost like one gone stark mad, Manning put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Skyrocket through a more grueling set of paces than</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever before been employed in testing a flier of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">size. Quick turns, vertical climbs, nose-dives, side-slips,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of which would have snapped an ordinary plane in</seg><seg type="columnLine">two, had little or no effect upon the sturdy Skyrocket.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last, Manning ordered full speed ahead, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane shot forward on a straight course. Slowly, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the craft gained velocity, the speedometer crept up;</seg><seg type="columnLine">three hundred miles per hour, four hundred, five hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred, six hundred, and so on until it stood almost at</seg><seg type="columnLine">six hundred and fifty!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Manning was extremely pleased with the perform-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance of the Skyrocket, and began immediately to lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">his plans for catching the Phantom. As a result, three</seg><seg type="columnLine">days later the Skyrocket again left its hangar; the hunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Hunt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR fully a week the Skyrocket combed the wildest</seg><seg type="columnLine">portions of the globe in search of the Phantom;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but no signs of the strange craft were to be seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Back and forth, over the western deserts, swept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">graceful Skyrocket, while sharp eyes scanned the blis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering sands below, searching--ever searching--for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smallest clue that might give an inkling as to the where-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abouts of the Phantom. From Alaska to the South Sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">Islands, the hunters scrutinized sea and land; but with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ail this time life aboard the ship was very pleasant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The huge electrostatic motors worked better than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Manning had even hoped; day after day they drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">the graceful flier forward without once faltering. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">the motors had been sufficiently broken in, Manning</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to ascertain the maximum speed of his new</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft. When the rate of 1,000 miles per hour was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached, the throttle still lacked a few notches of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day, as they were rounding the side of a moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain, on the eastern slope of the Andes, they came face</seg><seg type="columnLine">to face with the Phantom! Although only once before</seg><seg type="columnLine">had that craft been seen in daylight by those who lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell the tale, not a single man on board doubted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sharp pointed torpedo-shaped flier was the one they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had been seeking. On the appearance of the Skyrocket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Phantom, instead of attacking, veered round and</seg><seg type="columnLine">raced away to the south; the Skyrocket was instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hot pursuit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half-way round the world the chase lasted. Time</seg><seg type="columnLine">after time the Skyrocket crept up almost within gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot of the black quarry; and then the Phantom would</seg><seg type="columnLine">put on a burst of speed and draw away. For days the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most terrific race in history went on. The Phantom</seg><seg type="columnLine">was desperate, fleeing for its life; the Skyrocket was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting to make the world safe. Time after time, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men aboard the pursuer felt peculiar electric thrills pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">through their bodies. The Phantom was using its long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">range weapon, the engine-paralyzing ray; but it had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect upon the electric motors of Manning's ship. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">men on board the Skyrocket were beginning to tire of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chase when fate, in a playful mood, stepped in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed the Phantom to escape. In other words, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chase was in progress, among the East Indies, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific tropical thunder storm blew up.- The super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">charger on the Skyrocket became highly overloaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, although nothing of a serious nature developed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hunters were forced to abandon the chase for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. The Phantom had apparently dissolved into thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To say that Manning was disappointed is to put it</seg><seg type="columnLine">mildly; but with the never-say-die spirit that he pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessed, he proceeded to cruise ba?k and forth over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of islands that dot that portion of the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two days after the escape of the Phantom, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifting over an isolated island of considerable size,</seg><seg type="columnLine">about two hundred miles south of Java, when the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain shouted, "Look!" and pointed earthward. There,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a clearing, lay the Phantom; the chase was over!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Manning was for dropping down and attacking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarry on the spot; but the captain, who was still sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picious, convinced him that it might be a trap and that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly, the best thing to do was to act as though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Phantom had not been observed, land at some con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venient place, and scout back on foot to determine the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay of the land. So they landed and Richard, much</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the will of the captain, went scouting alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll be back in half an hour, probably," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but if I am not back in an hour come after me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Away he went into the jungle and, after five minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fighting his way through the underbrush, arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the edge of the clearing. He lay on his stomach be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind a bush and sized up the black ship; it lay sil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">houetted against a red sandstone cliff that rose perpen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicular, directly behind it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His observations were suddenly cut short by some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing landing on his back. Nearly all the wind was</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked from him and, before he could so much as</seg><seg type="columnLine">raise a finger, he found his hands securely tied with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of tough vine, and his arm being held in a grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a vise. His captor proved to be a gigantic Malay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the largest man that he had ever laid eyes upon, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood at least seven feet in height and must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighed fully three hundred pounds. The giant was</seg><seg type="columnLine">naked to the waist; but a pair of dirty duck trousers</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered the lower portion of his body. A greasy red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">and-white turban wound round his head completed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">scanty attire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Uga!" he grunted, pointing toward the Phantom;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, to make his meaning more clear, he gave Manning</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shove forward which nearly sent the latter sprawling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half-dragged, half-carried, Manning was taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard the ship of mystery which he had so long</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursued. Down a dimly-lighted and heavily-carpeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PHANTOM OF GALON	517</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor he was hurried, and through a heavy door at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end. He found himself in a softly-lighted luxur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ious room which served as the office, no doubt, for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiend who ruled the Phantom. The furnishings, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere of the place were undoubtedly oriental;</seg><seg type="columnLine">The heavy drapes which hung around the room were</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese, and the divan with its many pillows was purely</seg><seg type="columnLine">Persian. One who had read of the mysteries of harem</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, as they are pictured to the Western reader, might</seg><seg type="columnLine">well have expected to see some scantily-dressed beauties</seg><seg type="columnLine">reclining on the large divan. If so, great would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been his disappointment; for the only person in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room was a masked man, who half sat, half reclined, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large easy chair behind an exquisitely carved ebony</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk. But the thing which struck Richard as being most</seg><seg type="columnLine">extraordinary was that the man of mystery seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a prisoner on his own ship. He was fastened firmly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to all appearances, by several strands of heavy silk rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">which circled his body and which were doubtless secured</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some manner to the back of the chair. Richard im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately suspected the hooded individual of being the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same person at whom he had shot on the Ambassador.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At least the hood and cloak, the form, were identical;</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether or not it was the same man, he could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment after Manning and his captor entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the presence of the masked man, no word was spoken;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he could feel the fiery eyes behind the mask burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">into him. Then the master of the Phantom spoke in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">not displeasing voice, his English betraying an undefin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able foreign accent:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah! Meester Manning, welcome to Galon; we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been expecting thees visit and eet ees endeed a pleasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">to receive such an eemportant person. Eet ees rare that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have veeseetors." Pie paused a moment, then grunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to the giant Malay; and Manning had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction of feeling his bonds being loosed. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could follow his impulse to do something of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">violent nature, however, he was propelled backward</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the huge Malay and landed sprawling in an easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That ees much better, Meester Manning," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooded figure: "Now be calm, and we'll talk business."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Manning became as docile as a lamb; the Malay</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped across the room and stood by the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A sweet time I would have passing that gorilla!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought Manning: "I must think fast."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Back from the Dead!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">\ LTHOUGH he appeared to be the picture of meek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">f \ ness, his brain was moving lik,e lightning. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly, before the huge Malay could realize what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">happening, Manning was out of his chair, like a flash,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was across the room, and had torn the hood from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of the Phantom's master. When he saw the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus revealed he stepped back aghast. His face turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly white, a gasping cry gurgled in his throat, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black hood fell from his nerveless fingers. The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who sat in front of him was Richard Herrick, come</seg><seg type="columnLine">back from the dead!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Manning sank into a chair and buried his face in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. What turmoil raged in his breast. To think that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man who had been his best friend, and whom he</seg><seg type="columnLine">long believed to be dead and buried, should prove to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hated fiend of the Phantom! Silence reigned in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room. Even the giant Malay who had sprung to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herrick's assistance seemed to feel the tenseness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation, for he stood gazing at his master's face, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted with many emotions, on which he was looking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for the first time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    Herrick was the first to break the silence • "Richard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my boy, do not judge too hastily." He paused, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man did not move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will you please forget for a moment that I am the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Phantom' and listen to me?" There was no answer:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"For God's sake, Richard, you must hear me!" ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed Herrick frantically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Manning raised his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will listen," he said slowly and in a voice choked</seg><seg type="columnLine">by emotion, "but what can you say?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank God," breathed the "Phantom," sighing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief: "in half an hour all will be explained and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herrick will then be ready to join his fathers on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">banks of the Styx." He leaned back in his chair, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">after gazing vacantly into space for a moment, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">began:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Years ago, when you were but a lad, your father</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I were working together one day in the workshop.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An iron bar which hung suspended above us suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">came loose, struck me on the head, and knocked me</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconscious. The blow did not prove very serious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but your father insisted that I see a specialist in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be sure that everything was all right. I consulted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted authority on the brain; he took X-rays and told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that there was a slight dent in my skull; that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone was pressing slightly on the brain, but that it did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not present serious danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Nothing will come of it,' he told me, 'provided you</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead an active outdoor life and never allow your brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">to become fatigued.

But the ideas returned with renewed force,</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite all that I could do. A great fear clutched me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I consulted specialist after specialist. All recom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mended different things, but the main thing was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupy my mind with happy thoughts. But, as these</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideas gained force in my mind, my own doctor at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">sefit me to a private sanitarium; but I hated conditions</seg><seg type="columnLine">there.

Not finding her</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, he turned back to the terminal and his ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered his clearance papers, and soared away. Nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">did he see, in his preoccupation, a strange little man</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a wizened face and eagle eyes, who observed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">intently as he made his way to the controls of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship and sent it upward from the field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, for any curious observer who had followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little man, the only significance would have lain in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that, upon the clearance of each ship that morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for whatever port in whatever country, this man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to the cockpit of a long-range pursuit-plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearby on the field and tapped out a message in radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">code.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Strange Events</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN Fred Brettner had taxied down the field</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lifted the big freighter from the ground, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt somewhat relieved. Her five motors spurting flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the exhausts, the singing of the wind through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the braces, and the thought of the long trek to Guaya-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quil, Ecuador, all helped to stifle the turmoil in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. But, after five or ten minutes of the journey's</seg><seg type="columnLine">monotony, he thought of Nadia again. How could she</seg><seg type="columnLine">have left him at the moment when all their plans were</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have been consummated ? It was mysterious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The maid had merely found the note and given it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; she knew nothing more about it, and had no know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge of Nadia's whereabouts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He lifted the ship higher and gave her full throttle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He tried to quiet his nerves with a cigar.

Life shouldn't be a tragedy to a man, just because</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl he loved had seen fit to part from him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience would be all the more worth while when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had conquered the weakness in himself which caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to view it as a tragedy. And yet, how could he for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">get in an hour? He steadied himself and chewed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigar. Nadia's face seemed reflected in the cabin win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow; he slid the glass over to one side and breathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeply of the inrushing air. He could never forget;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a pilot must go on. If he had known a reason for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nadia's sudden departure--if anything had happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to separate them, he felt that he had a right to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. But there had been only the curt note: --"and please</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget me entirely--I can't explain--Nadia." And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motors of the great ship sang a weird song to a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	* *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Five minutes after Fred Brettner had hopped off for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guayaquil, Joe Blaine, senior pilot-captain of the Inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">national fleet, ordered all passengers aboard and lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his big amphibian off for Shanghai; the usual song in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heart stilled only by the sudden mystery of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">former mate's actions. Thinking it best to wait till</seg><seg type="columnLine">another time before questioning Brettner, Blaine had</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to make the best of matters. Safely on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, he turned over the controls to his new pilot-mate</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went aft toward the passenger quarters. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed the door of the radio room, a thought occurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him, and he went inside, to find the operator fran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically working over the set. Upon questioning the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man, Blaine learned that the conduits carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wiring from the air-driven generator had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">gutted. He poured questions at the operator: "You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure you didn't order the repairers to have them dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">connected for replacement?

Its only passenger</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the little eagle-eyed man'with the wizened face who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been so interested that morning whenever a plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the terminal of the International. But, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed at the other field and taxied over to the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanger which was open at that hour, it was only to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, as an unwilling passenger, Nadia Deneen, sweet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart of Fred Brettner! That she resisted being put</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard the craft was evident from her muffled screams</seg><seg type="columnLine">and attempts to pull away from her strong-armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">keepers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd 'a given her some dope, only we've got to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">her awake," said one of the men. And the wizen-faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot nodded assent as he shoved the throttle full out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and took off. At ten thousand feet, he leveled off and</seg><seg type="columnLine">steered a course southwest across the Pacific.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brettner Reflects</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THROUGHOUT the morning, the great Guaya-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quil-bound freighter was sliding onward toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tropics. Fred's mood had changed; he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking about the world he had left beneath him--new</seg><seg type="columnLine">in ideas, but as old as ever, and never truly sensible</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all! Though he was living in ^ day when marriage</seg><seg type="columnLine">was seemingly, no longer the mode, he himself was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">old-fashioned and conservative; and he had thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself fortunate to meet a girl who did not care for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new freedom demanded by so many of her sex.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, now, his dreams had been rudely shattered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Love was the greatest problem of life as it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">with so many others since the beginning of civilization.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In these days men were working for the love of work;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ideal of Social service had become a reality. Work</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a matter of serving the community and, therefore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">common co-operation had facilitated it in every way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In fact, the outer aspects of life had been so simplified</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the only great problem remaining was that of love,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world-old problem; and there is no such thing as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">logical solution of this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now the greatest blow that could come to a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had hit Fred, and he was trying to think his way out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was still in the stage when youth must analyze and</seg><seg type="columnLine">try with all its might to master itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reflected again. Back in the dark days of strife</seg><seg type="columnLine">in 1930, for instance, his grandfather had been one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those daring souls who piloted planes continuously to</seg><seg type="columnLine">FREEDOM OF THE SKIES	521</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Singapore. The old man could now remember several</seg><seg type="columnLine">instances when he had left Los Angeles with a feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would never return; but by sticking close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls, he had managed to avert the disasters his in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuition foretold, and had flown his ship through. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if his grandfather had accomplished that with all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry entailed by gasoline engines and the possibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dead motors, the distractions of navigation and such</seg><seg type="columnLine">details, he himself could certainly fly a modern per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fected plane to Guayaquil, however heavy his heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he was not long given to such reflections. For,</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hours after his leaving the terminal, a pursuit-plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew alongside and nosed up to attract his attention.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked her over; for a moment he wondered why</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plane should be so close. Then a hand shot out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the forward cockpit and waved to him. He banked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ship over to get a better view. When he did so, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Nadia, her face pale and frantic, making terrified</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestures to him 1 It looked as though she were telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to stay on his course and not follow. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew he must follow; one look at the face of the pilot</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose shifting, steely eyes glared in his direction, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fred Brettner made his decision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pursuit ship climbed steadily, and Fred followed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sixteen, eighteen, twenty thousand feet--and still up</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the clouds they sailed. He wondered why the pilot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the little plane should want such altitude. But it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not long before he was to know. When the pursuit</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane leveled off, its pilot shut off his motor and mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned for Fred to do likewise. Then the pilot yelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him: "If you want this girl to live, you'd better</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow me I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was all he said. He did not give Nadia a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to talk; instead, he turned about and headed westward</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the Pacific. Whereupon Fred Brettner gave his</seg><seg type="columnLine">five motors full throttle, and stayed close behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He searched his mind for possible reasons for this</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange manner of abducting Nadia. What could this</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinister pilot want of him ? He could not pay ransom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he was not a moneyed man, but only one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses. Why, in the name of Heaven, should anyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">resort to this method, to any method of breaking up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">happiness of a young couple who in this advanced day</seg><seg type="columnLine">were clinging to conservatism, to the traditions of finer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher-minded people? It had all come so suddenly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had not thought of his radio transmitter. He reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the switch and turned on the air-driven generator.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His first thought was an "SOS" message; but when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he clamped down on the key it was dead. No vacuum</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube glowed. He was helpless to tell the world of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nadia's plight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Captured!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER three hours of flight, during which time</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brettner's mind had been considering a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibilities of what was happening, the pursuit ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">throttled down slowly and nosed downwards, Fred</seg><seg type="columnLine">following her with his heavy cargo plane. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">below, but saw no sign of a landing place in the limit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less expanse of water. However, the pilot of the smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship contihued to spiral and lose altitude, until she</seg><seg type="columnLine">leveled off for a moment, and then silently slid toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flat surface that was almost level with the sea. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the plane make a perfect landing, and then himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">circled for position to do likewise. Then he realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was approaching what seemed to be a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, floating upon the surface of the Pacific. He slid</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big cargo carrier down upon it, and taxied up be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the pursuit ship, at the side of which were now</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting Nadia and the pilot. When he had cut his</seg><seg type="columnLine">motors and hurried out of the cabin to join them, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was met by two men who, it seemed, had suddenly ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared from nowhere. They took positions on either</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of him, each seizing one of his arms in a tight</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp. "Any discussion must be with the Grand</seg><seg type="columnLine">Master," said the one on his left. "You are ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to ask questions concerning your presence here</seg><seg type="columnLine">until you are before him," said the one on his right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brettner's only concern was for Nadia. "Can I see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl first?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His escort on the left nodded and turned with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pilot of the pursuit-plane had pressed a button</seg><seg type="columnLine">which opened a huge trapdoor, into which his craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wheeled. Nadia was left to join Fred and the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. She hurried to him, her large eyes filled with tears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The guards permitted their embraces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fred, what can all this mean?" she asked. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to my apartment and forced me to write that awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">message to you--it wasn't true 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll have to make the best of it," he whispered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It looks like a big kettleful of devilment to me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose they took you in order to make me follow. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't steal our planes from the hangar--they want</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cargo, you see. It's been hinted about that a cargo</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane is always in danger--especially when it carries</seg><seg type="columnLine">valuable electrical and chemical apparatus, as mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">does."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But isn't it dangerous--will they let us live?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Please don't think of that. They won't harm you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or me," he said with assurance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But they won't let us go back home; they will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid we will reveal their rendezvous."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fred looked around the island-like structure:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Apparently they can move it. It has the color of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea, when you look at it from above, and it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard to locate."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the men stepped between them:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Grand Master will receive you below in three</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes," he said, almost pleasantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They followed the guards down through a hatchway</seg><seg type="columnLine">and into an enormous compartment. "This thing cost</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to build to keep a thousand people in luxury</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the rest of their lives," commented Brettner: "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Grand Master' must have fabulous riches."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That need not be true," Nadia reminded him:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There may be a thousand of them in partnership."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think your deductions will not be borne out," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fred and stopped. They were soon following the guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a hallway and into a reception room. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked for an instant down another aisle which ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended for what appeared to be the length of a city</seg><seg type="columnLine">block. The ship, or whatever it was, appeared to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deck surface of five of the large battleships of fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years before, but whatever went on within it was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mystery to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently a door was opened before them, and before</seg><seg type="columnLine">them stood a tall, well-built young man, apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">about twenty-five, dressed in a one-piece suit of black</seg><seg type="columnLine">velvet with a sash about his waist. His face was ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressionless, and its paleness gave it a waxen appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance ; but there was a ringing quality in his well-modu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated voice: "It is my duty to warn you to speak the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole truth in all matters pertaining to yourselves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, only, will you be allowed the freedom of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">decks, and avoid harm to yourselves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's just the man I want to see," said Fred.

I'll bet he's one of those Napoleonic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eccentrics, like certain capitalists of post-war days who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are said to have possessed such a complex for power."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Nalia laughed, even her eyes twinkled: "If you didn't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have a sense of humor I'd feel blue," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But it's true," muttered Brettner. "Think of it--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">kidnapping you 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The two young people were ushered into an immense</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">room which was lined with blue and golden tapestries,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with elaborate furniture everywhere, about a large desk</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the center. There were multi-colored lights spaced</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upon the walls, and their reflection gave the place a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">weird atmosphere. At the desk sat a young man,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">apparently no more than thirty, with keen blue eyes,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blonde hair and the form of a Greek athlete. He was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dressed, as were the guards, in a one-piece suit of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">velvet; but he wore a silver crest, the top of which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">consisted of an eagle with wings spread to the winds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The orderly silently placed two chairs before the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">desk and motioned them to be seated; then he dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">appeared through the door and it closed. When Fred</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and Nadia had seated themselves, the man at the desk</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spoke in a rich, deep voice: "You are before the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Grand Master of The Conquerors of the Skies," he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">began: "When I say the 'Conquerors of the Skies,' I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">refer to the most powerful organization in the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Our aim is to control the air; suffice to say that we are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">assured of success. You are now within our citadel,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which is the largest submarine structure ever built.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It can be submerged in eight minutes. Our methods of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">action, at present, are confined to the demoralization of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the pilots and crews of the International Airliners."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Grand Master paused and smiled: "My men have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">disabled the radio instruments on all liners passing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">within five hundred miles of our position. This vessel</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is a floating nation--we call it Manno. Marino shall</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">conquer the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Now, Captain Brettner, our reason for abducting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">your sweetheart, was to ensure the presence here of this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">young lady while we are gaining possession of an added</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">number of ships."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Grand Master paused. Brettner's face was sud-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">_ denly a livid white; he understood that Nadia was to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be held as hostage for some infamous purpose. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">words of the Grand Master ate into his soul. And he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">must see her suffer for the greed of such a man as the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one sitting before him 1 He wanted to fly at the throat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the pirate, but instead he turned suddenly in his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chair and hoarsely whispered her name, "Nadia--Nadia</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--My God--you 1" Their eyes met, two pairs of richly-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tinted pools with everything that they held worth while</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reflected in them. They could not speak. Only the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fortitude of the girl whose eyes met his gave Brettner</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">courage to look again at the Grand Master. The latter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "It isn't such a tragedy, Captain Brettner. You shall</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not be deprived of the society of this young lady. I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">give you my word of honor that Miss Deneen shall</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">remain unharmed, with the freedom of the decks, as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">long as you obey orders. I don't want her; I want you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "May I ask why ?" demanded Brettner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought it was obvious," smiled the Grand Master:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I shall make it clear, however. You are to return to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mainland in a ship piloted by one of our men. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are to tell the officials of your company that you lost the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship by accident and that you were rescued by this man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meanwhile, Miss Deneeen remains with us as security</seg><seg type="columnLine">for your loyalty to us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One of my pilots with a light amphibian monoplane</seg><seg type="columnLine">will take you. Upon your arrival in Los Angeles, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are to make only the necessary explanations; and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you get command of another plane --a cargo carrier--</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will fly her here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And if I refuse?" At his words Brettner felt Nadia</seg><seg type="columnLine">start. Before the Grand Master could reply, she spoke:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You mustn't give yourself to dishonor for such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, Fred--I'll--I'll do anything before you shall!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You will be wiser not to refuse," said the Grand</seg><seg type="columnLine">Master: "If you agree, and then betray us, our detec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive force, which covers the movements of every one</seg><seg type="columnLine">connected with the International, will discover it. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">agents are everywhere. You must consider. Why, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">this young lady consents you may even be married</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard--we have a chaplain--and live in luxury with</seg><seg type="columnLine">us indefinitely. We can always use you, captain. Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of air craft will enable you to bring a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of planes to our decks. And, after we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">accumulated enough additional supplies from cargo</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes, we shall put our forces in motion for a conquest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why didn't you buy the planes at first, and save</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself the expense of building this great ship?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brettner, intrigued by curiosity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Grand Master still smiled:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We had to have headquarters, captain! We knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, in order to maintain an immense number of air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes, we would need a hiding place. The land portion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the world--that which is comfortable--is now</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely within the scrutiny of adventurous airmen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know of no place outside the frigid zones where one</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be so secure as we are here in Marino. You must</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember we are a nation; and, as a nation, we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to conquer the world. This meager start of ours</seg><seg type="columnLine">is only to secure airplanes and supplies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have ten thousand pilots, all belonging to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Order--all ready upon an hour's notice to come aboard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As fast as we capture the ships of the International,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have men ready to assume command of them. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have marked out immense stores of explosives in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">different parts of the world, which will be picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">by our planes, swarms of them, when we are ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, we are not cutthroats, Captain; but we are de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined. We need more than the hundred ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we have aboard. We want ten thousand--enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cover all the cities of the world--and all the high</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosives available. We must work fast, yet with care.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therefore, my final word to you is: If you wish to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Deneen live happily--or live at all--follow my</seg><seg type="columnLine">instructions to the letter!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brettner Meditates</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE two young people gasped. The Grand Master</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded and pointed to the door: "Go," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still smiling to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the last word of the Grand Master, a guard entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room and guided the two captives through another</seg><seg type="columnLine">door into the great aisle. There they met another mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">FREEDOM OF THE SKIES	523</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of the Order, who told them to follow him. Several</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet farther down, the man stopped where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor was lined on either side by a number of doors;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he opened one of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is the room of the young woman," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She will enter here and make herself as comfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">as possible. Five minutes will be given the captain to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say 'farewell'; and then he must accompany pilot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane No.v78 to the mainland."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two young people immediately forgot the pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence of their guard. But there was no time for them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">discuss a possible plan of action. Unashamed they em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">braced, and Nadia whispered: "I'm afraid I'm costing</seg><seg type="columnLine">you your honor--your life, Fred!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He kissed her: "It's worth it!" he said. He held her</seg><seg type="columnLine">close and thought hard for a moment. No idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape coming to him, he thought of her welfare as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner. "Remember the old formula, dear--let us live</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the memory of our love, no matter how unpleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">our path."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She sighed: "You always thought of things, Fred.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You'll--" she lowered her voice to a whisper which</seg><seg type="columnLine">only he could hear"--you'll find a way out of this, too 1"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whereupon the guard took his arm and ordered him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to depart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brettner, in order to leave Nadia there in the door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of her quarters, had needed all his will-power. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole affair was so contrary to every ideal he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">cherished--freedom, love, the inheritance of every</seg><seg type="columnLine">American to live without slavery and without force!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And now a daring act of piracy had placed him in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He must find some way to combat this Grand Master</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his wild dreams. He wondered curiously why the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grand Master should wish to conquer the world; why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fact, any one should be so greedy. And yet, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasoned further, the Grand Master might possess ideals</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his own. Perhaps the ruler of this floating kingdom</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to reign over the entire world, so that it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">attain even greater civilization and progress. But again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">why should he set himself up as the arbiter of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world's destiny? There was little suffering at least in</seg><seg type="columnLine">America. Nor was the age-old cry of misery now ring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the lips of the newer and finer generation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europeans. Prosperity, throughout the world, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought about by a great program of cooperation be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween individuals and nations, all of whom had realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this planet is small and that the happiness of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">means the happiness of each individual.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, in this age of peace and plenty, there had arisen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spectre of this gigantic piracy-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was walking along the decks, escorted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard, when his mind came back to the reality of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he must face. The Grand Master meant business.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many millions of dollars had been expended in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">submarine structure alone, how many millions he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not calculate. It was an immense thing, occupying an</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost inconceivable space in the water. It was so built</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, when it came to the surface, only the decks were</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible. The remainder of the ship was under water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he saw that it was almost indestructible by attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the water. It had thousands and thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartments and watertight doors. It contained im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense machine shops and dynamos, and that newly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceived apparatus for the taking of motor fuel from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the different elements. Power? If appearance did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie, the Grand Master had power; if his assertion were</seg><seg type="columnLine">true, that ten thousand pilots belonged to his Order,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie had enormous power; for no nation on earth had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed more than that, since war had vanished from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth. And now, in place of international war, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful individual was arising to menace the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Another Capture</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON his way up to the surface, Brettner saw hundreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men and many women carrying on the multi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tudinous details of life, and all apparently happy in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their surroundings. At first he had believed that they,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, were fanatics carrying out the wishes of a fanatical</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader. But their cheerful industry and efficient manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of carrying on their life astounded him. The guards,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who appreciated Brettner's astonishment, seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel the chasm between them; for there was not an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unnecessary word spoken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently they arrived at a great opening that led up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the deck. Here the sun shone in, and here and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the great lead-covered cables of the sun-power</seg><seg type="columnLine">converters. As Brettner learned, the sun's energy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being converted into electrical energy which was stored</seg><seg type="columnLine">in great batteries to be used during days of the inevit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able fog. They climbed the stairs--ladder, in the lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guage of the sea--and emerged upon the huge deck. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">large plane was sliding down for a landing, and another</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pursuit-planes preceded it. As the large ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">came closer, Brettner recognized it as a big trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pacific passenger liner of the International. And, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made out the ship's number, he gave a start; for this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Joe Blaine's craft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the ship had finally landed and taxied into</seg><seg type="columnLine">position near the hatchway, Captain Blaine emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the gangway, under guard, and looked about him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with bewilderment written on his face. He saw Fred,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a start, hurriedly started toward him. The guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">intercepted them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For God's sake!" said Blaine excitedly: "Was this</seg><seg type="columnLine">your game, Brettner, when you asked for a cargo plane?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And you are in with that gang of pirates that disguised</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves as passengers and seized my ship!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guards motioned their prisoner away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''No, Joe," Brettner answered quickly: "I'm as</seg><seg type="columnLine">innocent as you are. I wanted that cargo plane so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be alone, but I discovered later that these people</seg><seg type="columnLine">had abducted my sweetheart. I followed them, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Heavens!" gasped Blaine. He was silent for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment. "Soriy, old man, I was so hasty I" The</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards were forcing him down the ladder. Brettner</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved at him and turned to his guard: "I'm ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">now," he said simply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently a small amphibian plane was wheeled from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the elevator, and a pilot came out to tune up the motor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He called Captain Brettner to enter the cockpit. Fred</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed in, the plane rose and they were off on a zig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zag course in the general direction of the California</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast. This wavering flight was, evidently, the ruse</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Marino's flyers used to cover their tracks. Six</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours later they slipped into a small, unpretentious air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port, a few miles from the Grand Central Terminal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the plane had landed, and the motor was cut out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Marino pilot said: "You're to phone and tell your</seg><seg type="columnLine">headquarters that you crashed on the mountains in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fog, and that I rescued you." Brettner picked up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument and, dialing his office, spoke to the superin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendent, repeating the story which had been prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Brettner had finished, his companion asked:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What do your officials say?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fred tried to make light of the situation:</seg><seg type="columnLine">524	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''They're all up in the air," he said smiling, "and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they knew of the existence of Marino there'd be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden war. I hear that Blaine and his ship disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">between here and Honolulu, without a word or even an</seg><seg type="columnLine">'SOS.' The officials don't know what to make of it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they're naturally disappointed in me for having lost my</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. I'll have a hard time sticking to my story."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You'd better stick to it, though!" snapped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grand Master's henchman: "It is useless to fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marino, even if you were yellow enough to desert your</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl and tell the truth. You'd never see her again--and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe me, you yourself wouldn't live longer than</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-four hours I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Brettner shuddered. "I suppose you have the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">of me 1" he said: "Well, Skipper, if we're to be friendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies, let's get down to brass tacks. Are your men</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to make life miserable for me by shadowing me?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pilot from Marino nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, will there be any objections to my going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my girl'd apartment and getting her some of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brettner thanked him: "I'll go to the office first, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrange to leave, if they'll trust me with another plane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow morning. South to Guayaquil on the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">route. I'll meet you two hours out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't bother about the time," said his companion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rather good-natured fellow who had seemed pleased</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Brettner's nickname of "Skipper": "I'll follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">you out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But don't you think headquarters will want to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and thank you for having saved the life of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">valuable pilot-captain ?" Brettner said satirically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes! I brought you here only so that our agent</seg><seg type="columnLine">would know ahead of time about your arrival. Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">offices are buzzing with excitement by now. Our man</seg><seg type="columnLine">is one of your employees, and will be watching you</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you arrive. Let's go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They got into the plane again and, after skimming</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the residential section of the city, landed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grand Central Terminal. As they did so, the chief dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patcher came out to meet the plane. He was, by name,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gastro--a short, fat man with a heavy shock of grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">liair. His peculiar appearance had made him an out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing character in the minds of the patrons of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">International. No one who had ever seen him could</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget his oily face and his great hair. And, strangely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was smiling when he shook Fred's hand in greeting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The loss of those three planes has certainly aroused</seg><seg type="columnLine">the officials," he said: "But I'm glad you're safe."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The acute Brettner could not help noting, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">introduced his 'rescuer,' that the eyes of the two met in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a manner that told that they were already friends. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">exchanged ostentatiously formal greetings and talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">as strangers. But, as Fred Brettner looked from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to the other and reviewed the events of the day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was awestruck by the possibilities inherent in Castro's</seg><seg type="columnLine">association with Marino.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gastro</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GASTRO accompanied Brettner through the throng</seg><seg type="columnLine">of planes and into the field office, leaving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot with his plane. Fred took a seat across</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the dispatcher, who had relighted his inevitable</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigar and was regarding him blandly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The officials are deeply concerned about so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">mishaps, Captain," he began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fred felt that strange shudder run through his body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We have lost three planes today," continued the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispatcher, "and you are the only pilot who has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky enough to return. It is reported that a number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of privately-owned planes have disappeared suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">while on cruises. I do not know to what we may</seg><seg type="columnLine">attribute these strange disappearances. But we've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go on. The commerce of the world must not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">delayed by the loss of a few ships." He chewed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ropey cigar for awhile and studied the floor: "I'm giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">you another ship, Captain. I suppose I'd give you any</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of ships before losing faith in you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brettner gasped, it was all working so smoothly. "Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I--" His voice fell: "Thank you, Gastro."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dispatcher rose and walked up and down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. He had lost his blandness and was now visibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous. "Good Heavens, Captain," he said finally, "we</seg><seg type="columnLine">mustn't lose all our ships! We've got to have men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">will exert every effort to save their commands, even at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the expense of their own lives. You asked for a cargo</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane this morning--were you afraid to take passengers</seg><seg type="columnLine">out on your first trip?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said Brettner: "I wanted to be alone--I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">some trouble." His voice fell: "My fiancee suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared, leaving me only a line or two. I suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's my own affair, though!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," said Gastro: "Of course--Of course."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He said it the third time, as though the words fascinated</seg><seg type="columnLine">him: "Come around tomorrow and I'll give you another</seg><seg type="columnLine">cargo plane--with an important load for Buenos Aires.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You must get it through. Good night!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good night I" said Captain Brettner, in a mechanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. On the street again he was suddenly conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">of being in the hands of so powerful an Order, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">agents in such unexpected places that he did not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom to trust. His best friend might have belonged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it. "Conquerors of the World," eh? Well, they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Nothing short of death could now relieve him of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his responsibilities to them, responsibilities which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must fulfill if he was to save Nadia from death or</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse. He had the consolation, at least, that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never have stolen a penny for his own gain. But to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save the life of Nadia, what might he not do? "Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">querors of the World?" And wrecking the happiness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth in order to fulfill a mad dream. Of course that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be their method. Entrap young men into their</seg><seg type="columnLine">Order, to get them to deliver their stolen planes. Planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">cost thousands of dollars. A big cargo ship such as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one Fred had landed upon the deck of Marino had cost</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred thousand, to say nothing of its costly</seg><seg type="columnLine">freight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whew!" he breathed. "This Order has the system.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their planes cheaply obtained--stolen. Ready to rob</seg><seg type="columnLine">government stores of explosives. Using the sun's</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy to give them power. Gee, if I could only induce</seg><seg type="columnLine">the government to raid Marino!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he knew he dared not make a false move. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was certain to be observed, and the result would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sudden death of Nadia. No, there must be a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">subtle way. Schemes ran through his mind; but none</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them seemed practicable. Men were watching him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps the very policemen in the streets belonged to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Order. An attempt to converse with a policeman</seg><seg type="columnLine">might bring about his death. How many people were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hands of this fanatical Graud Master ? So many</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes had disappeared that day as to alarm the govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment officials. The news bulletins carried shouting</seg><seg type="columnLine">headlines of great losses all over the land, sudden dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearances for which there were no clues. While pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">FREEDOM OF THE SKIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a newspaper office on his way to Nadia's apartment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heard the radio announcement from the governor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">office, of an additional reward of twenty thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars for information leading to the discovery of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">missing passenger plane. Brettner shrugged his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders. The world was totally unaware of what it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was facing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At Nadia's apartment, he procured her key from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landlord' who knew him well. In her living room, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood motionless for a moment. The atmosphere brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">back so many memories, and struck so much terror to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heart when he thought of what she might suffer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he sank into a chair and covered his head with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. Is life like this? One tries his best to live</seg><seg type="columnLine">honorably, by the law of his being, and a great, crushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">force arises to smash his life to bits. •</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within his mind was the consciousness of having a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great battle to fight. He must not give way to weakness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He must be strong and clever. Were the battle for him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self only, he might have taken a great chance, a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot. But, with Nadia's life hanging in the balance, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their love restrained, their entire futures threatened</seg><seg type="columnLine">with ruin, only the subtlest moves could save them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew what he meant to her and what she expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him. He must not disappoint her. But this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a question of pride--it was a fight for her life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The flyers who had first hopped across the ocean had</seg><seg type="columnLine">only their own lives at stake and could take chances;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could take none. He must save Nadia and, in doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, he would save the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Captain Brettner took a small traveling bag and</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled it with Nadia's belongings; after which he hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried back to his hotel. Ceaselessly his mind reviewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the possibilities of combatting the forces of Marino.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No possible way of telling the governor. They would</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill Nadia and himself, even though he succeeded. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest move toward giving away the secret might</seg><seg type="columnLine">resuit in his death. The only means by which he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">act through his employers would be discovered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gastro who, he was sure, was a traitor in the employ</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Marino. And yet he could prove nothing when</seg><seg type="columnLine">called upon to do so. He decided to attempt a few hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">of needed sleep, which might help to unravel the tangle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thoughts which ran through his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just before he reached the entrance of his hotel a</seg><seg type="columnLine">passer-by came close to him as they approached, speak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing low and quickly: "Remember, Marino watches you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Go to your room. You will be watched from the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjoining yours." The man went on with unchanged</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace, leaving Brettner on the curb staring backward at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in amazement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Two Conspirators Meet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Buenos Aires freight plane was loaded and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting the next morning when Captain Brettner</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked nonchalantly into the office and saluted Gastro,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a forced smile upon his face. Gastro seemed sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised; and, when he had handed Fred his orders and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the young man had gone out again whistling cheerfully,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dispatcher shook his head and whispered, "Game</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A stranger who had landed his plane on the field</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried into the office. Gastro appeared not to observe</seg><seg type="columnLine">him until four skylarking pilots had passed on through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gate nearby; after which he nodded to the new-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comer. There was a whispered conversation between</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better keep Brettner aboard after this," said Gastro:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's the only new man you've risked sending ashore--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous business."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The strange pilot nodded slightly: "True, but we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have his sweetheart. He's a valuable man. The Grand</seg><seg type="columnLine">Master needs him for the dangerous work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I see. He wanted to see if Brettner could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">trusted, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That's it," said the pilot: "His hands are tied. Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">tip about placing his young woman in our power was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good one. I have been told while aboard that, if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shows any hesitation hereafter, he will get what all</seg><seg type="columnLine">traitors get--the extermination room."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The what?" Gastro's face paled as he leaned toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stranger. The latter looked at him intently:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The extermination room. A bare room with vents</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the walls to admit a gas that disintegrates whoever</seg><seg type="columnLine">is inside."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "My God I" thought the dispatcher.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The pilot continued proudly: "It was I who suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Grand Master that this room be put to use in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case of all prisoners we cannot use, as well as for</seg><seg type="columnLine">traitors. We are holding the threat of it over the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman, to ensure her lover carrying out the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gastro shuddered inwardly at this man's words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, the great mission?" he said absently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pilot nodded: "The thing that only the Grand</seg><seg type="columnLine">Master knows. However, he is now sorry that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted this young man to lose a plane and thus lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">favor in the eyes of the officials. It would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">better to allow him to gain more of their confidence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then turn everything over to us. It seems that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marino's success lies in the hands of Captain Brettner."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pilot smiled again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The Grand Master is very astute," breathed Gastro.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pilot's eyes narrowed: "No one dares to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">him unwise!" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "If I had done so, I would never have accepted your</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposition," said the dispatcher: "But I want to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ruler of one of those South American lands."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Your wish will be gratified when we have suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded," said the pilot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	* *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Captain Brettner lifted his plane above the fog, south</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Los Angeles, and set his course indicator for Buenos</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aires. He must fly along it for a few hours to avert</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicion, before turning toward Marino. His great</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem kept revolving through his mind, in the depths</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which he felt there must be a solution. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerfully have given his own life, if that would help.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But there was Nadia; what was happening to her now?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Would they ever be free to love each other again, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go their own way as free men and women do? He</seg><seg type="columnLine">writhed inwardly. Then he straightened and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">coolly to consider matters. He was in a most singular</seg><seg type="columnLine">position. There was one possibility by which, if nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">interfered, he could save the world from Marino. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">solution to his problem he saw lay in Nadia's ability, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">send a message to Metter, the greatest chemist of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, whom he knew. Metter had finally proved that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could place, in the bulk of a bomb a man could carry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an explosive powerful enough to destroy everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a mile; the discovery had just been reported</seg><seg type="columnLine">briefly in the radio news bulletin, which he had tuned</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, while in his room the night before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two hours out--five hundred miles from Los Angeles</seg><seg type="columnLine">--there drew alongside the pursuit-plane which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken him ashore the evening before. The pilot did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even look his way, but turned towards the west; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brettner followed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">526	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Brettner moved along behind the other plane, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought returned to Metter and his tremendous inven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Then he thought of another resource which might,</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly, save the situation. The psychological experts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his day, exponents of the development of the human</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, had so nearly reached perfection in their science</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the long scoffed-at feat of mental telepathy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to be realized among them. If he could only "tune</seg><seg type="columnLine">in" on one of them and tell his great secret, the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiver of it might be able to awaken the nations to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their danger. He would try it, not knowing whether or</seg><seg type="columnLine">not he was succeeding in the least. He would endeavor</seg><seg type="columnLine">to communicate with one of them in particular--Profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sor Ray, whom he had met months before, on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vladivostok-bound air-liner. The professor had then</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned, and had demonstrated, some of the funda-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental principles of mental telepathy, which Brettner</seg><seg type="columnLine">had absorbed with the greatest interest. But he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know where the professor might then be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, he took from his pocket a small ball, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">common steel ball which had come from a bearing, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">used this tiny convex mirror as a concentration point;</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus making use of the principles which had set forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the professor, he looked into the glistening object</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment and focussed his mind upon a mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture of Professor Ray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The image did not api&gt;ear for some five minutes, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">which time the plane hit a rough spot in the air and</seg><seg type="columnLine">required his undivided attention. Fred looked up to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pursuit-plane above him. He then reverted to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crudity of several decades before and swore aloud.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was angry; his anger served him well. For, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he again looked into the ball, with fierce determination</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his soul, the image of the professor stood out better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than he could have expected. He believed that he now</seg><seg type="columnLine">had mental access to Professor Ray. But he kept his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind off Marino. He made a mental picture of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">room at the hotel, with the professor entering. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentally told the professor to wait therein for him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">three days hence, at two in the afternoon when he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected to arrive. Perhaps futile, perhaps dangerous.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was a drowning man grasping a straw. Would Ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognize him and conceive what urgent need might</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie behind this unusual request?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently Brettner straightened his plane again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked about him. He was flying straight. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the ball again, hoping the professor would respond.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He closed his mind to everything save the supreme</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort, desperately concentrating on Professor Ray's</seg><seg type="columnLine">image and the message. Finally he relaxed, as he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mental picture of the professor nodding at him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">relaxed and wiped the sweat from his forehead. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped that his conversation with the professor had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">red; that it was not a product simply of his fervid</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">What Nadia Revealed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SOME time later, Fred Brettner looked out to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pursuit-plane hovering near, nosing down for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing. He saw the little plane slip several thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, circle and then slide down to the ocean surface.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It must be Marino. It was I He saw the plane taxi up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the elevator and disappear. He circled the great deck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">put the great freighter "on her ear," and slipped for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing. He came in slowly, with the old "Lindbergh</seg><seg type="columnLine">skill," as Blaine had called it. He had often thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">how skillful the Lone Eagle must have been, to fly</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a contraption as The Spirit of, St. Louis across</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Atlantic with a low-powered motor of his times.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blaine had commented that Brettner could have done it</seg><seg type="columnLine">before breakfast with a modern plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guards met him as he descended to the deck. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a word was spoken. He was ushered below into a room</seg><seg type="columnLine">where there was a table, with food and plates for two,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was instructed to wait for five minutes. At the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that time Nadia came through a door opposite. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">embraced. It all seemed too good to be true. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trap, he was certain, and he wondered how he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell her. As he gazed at her, her eyes showed a glint of</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding. They talked of trivial things and avoided</seg><seg type="columnLine">the topic which most concerned them. There must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">eavesdroppers about. He could see that she wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to scream in the tension she was under, but she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing up like a good soldier. Nothing weak or petty</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Nadia!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I brought your things," he said: "Left them in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane. If they permit you to have them, I am sure they</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be delivered safely to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Was there a letter for me?" she asked, munching</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sandwich.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, darling, nor does the landlord seem worried</seg><seg type="columnLine">about your sudden disappearance. I suppose he knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">all about it. Marino is all-powerful. I must do all I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can to serve her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw a sudden look of pain come into her eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So she didn't understand. Her look showed that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">now believed that he had deliberately trapped her, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he himself was a member of the Order. She didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know he was lying for her sake. But there were prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably cunningly-concealed microphones in the room and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, telephoto instruments which showed every</seg><seg type="columnLine">facial expression. His own countenance, he felt pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully sure, seemed unconcerned. She saw it, perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a deceitful face covering the subtle actions of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man whom she had loved. He dared not tell her that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was not a member, not even a sympathizer of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Order. Yet he could not continue the meal in painful</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence. He had to talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Marino has great possibilities," he went on reck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly : "It is governed by the greatest mind the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">has ever known. I now believe he should be the dictator</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it all. He is a conqueror, but he does not wish to</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroy. He wants only to rule wisely. I am his ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vant. Perhaps, after all he has accomplished his purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and I am going to exert every effort in his behalf--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he will be kind enough to give me a place of trust and</seg><seg type="columnLine">importance. Who knows?" He breathed a sigh and</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoided her lode.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A door opened; a guard entered, stood silently for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, and then motioned for Brettner to follow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then terror filled Fred's soul. Nadia had risen from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her chair, screaming:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take me out there--out there to that horrible room</seg><seg type="columnLine">--For God's sake take me out and let me die!

You must understand,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he pleaded: "Have faith in me and in Marino."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!" she shrieked: "I'll die first! You didn't tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me--you took my life in your hands, so that you could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have me with you in your association with these pirates!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	hate you with all the bitterness of one who has loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and discovered what a criminal you are.

I would rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">die than marry you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">FREEDOM OF THE SKIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes followed her as she tottered to a seat. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">great pity filled him, but he knew he must go on. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was looking at him again, and he forced himself to face</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wish they would let me walk into that room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">die," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What room?" he asked, suddenly ignoring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard's tug at his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Nadia uttered harshly: "Into that room where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards drove a hundred prisoners of your Order of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Conquerors of the World!

He was blinded in the flood of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bewildering thoughts. His uncertain footsteps faltered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had stood up under so much that the addition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this terrible news found him unequal to the situation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He, too, fainted, and merciful unconsciousness brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace to his soul.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           CHAPTER V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           Some Regrets</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Grand Master of the Conquerors of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">World had dismissed his advisers and retired into</seg><seg type="columnLine">solitude in his magnificent headquarters. He was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some reason, in lower spirits than usual. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">he regretted that the laws which he had laid down for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marino had exacted the lives of so many prisoners.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps he felt himself in the power of an organization</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had started and which he ruled, and yet one</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he himself could not deter from its course. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">may have been reviewing swiftly his youthful idealistic</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream of the conquest he was now engaged in. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed many in the initial work of building this great</seg><seg type="columnLine">submarine and equipping it. Yet he had never wished to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill anyone--even for power. And, although he perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the world already in the palm of his hand, he now</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that he had made a mistake, had gone against his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own conscience, in decreeing the death of his prisoners.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And in this hour he was nervously upset. In his agony</seg><seg type="columnLine">and regret, he thought of ending his own life. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">restored his firmness in the belief that, once having</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplished his purpose of dominating the world, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might again forget--live down the terrible memory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evening before when Captain Joseph Blaine had</seg><seg type="columnLine">marched before a hundred other pilots and mechanics</seg><seg type="columnLine">into that room of extermination, and to an unexpected</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. He was still trying to clear his mind of the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">compunctions when the door of his office opened, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his first aide came in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An important message for Your Excellency," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Proceed," snapped the Grand Master.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Captain Brettner, whom you ordered to report on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arrival, has collapsed upon hearing of the death</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his comrades, Sire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Grand Master's face paled:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who permitted him to know of this?

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquainted her with his desire to become a servant of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marino; upon which she told him of the disintegration</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and what happened there last night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Grand Master did not lose control of himself,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">527</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> as a lesser leader might have done. He had indulged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in useless regrets, perhaps, but they must not deter his</seg><seg type="columnLine">action. What had happened was now irreparable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How many planes have we aboard ?" demanded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grand Master.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Three hundred and ninety-eight, Sire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Grand Master breathed deeply: "Radio to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gastro ashore; he will meet our pilot in Captain Brett-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner's room in the hotel in Los Angeles. Be sure to send</seg><seg type="columnLine">a resourceful man for him. Also, have five hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our pilots ready for action upon an hour's notice;</seg><seg type="columnLine">have their planes here and ashore equipped for destruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Have the Grand Marshal remind them that, if there</seg><seg type="columnLine">exists a traitor among them, he will die immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon being discovered. Deliver these orders yourself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now have a guard bring Captain Brettner here." The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grand Master's voice fell abruptly. He wished he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">simplify matters; but, as they stood, the world must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">conquered before it could learn of the power which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being massed against it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Brettner was brought in and placed on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chaise longue before the Grand Master, for he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still too weak to sit up. His audience with the Grand</seg><seg type="columnLine">Master came as a relief; but he was determined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep his lips closed and learn all that was possible. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grand Master smiled reassuringly upon him:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have done good work, Captain. You have</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed two valuable cargo ships in our hands without</seg><seg type="columnLine">being suspected. Their cargoes alone are of great utility</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Marino. The planes I will use in the work of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducing several important cities along the North and</seg><seg type="columnLine">South Pacific coasts. How do you feel about all this;</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially if I offer you, when we have triumphed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the governorship of Argentina?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fred was thoughtful for a moment:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A most unusual offer--a governorship. Yes, if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be of such service as to merit such an office, your</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest wish is a command. My only request is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you relieve Miss Deneen of the mental suffering which</seg><seg type="columnLine">came of her belief that I had purposely allied myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you and was aware of the plans for her abduction</seg><seg type="columnLine">before it came about. Tell her what you may, other-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise. However, I prefer that you should release her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and retain me to help you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She would tell the world of our plans," objected the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grand Master: "No! With her, matters shall stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they are until you have carried out the great mission</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I have planned for you. If I permitted her re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lease, I might not trust you fully to carry out this</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission. Upon your completion of the great task for</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I have chosen you, I give you my word of honor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and the young lady shall be free citizens of Marino;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not until then."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you wish of me--what is this great task</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which you speak ?" asked Brettner, weakly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Grand Master resumed his scat. His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparkled and his forceful voice was impressive: "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gather from an informant ashore that you are ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quainted with the great scientist. Metter," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Slightly," agreed Fred: "He was a passenger on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my plane, on several trips."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">New Orders</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Grand Master was apparently pleased with</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. "Professor Ray was right," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Professor Ray!" gasped Fred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Grand Master nodded: "One of my worthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">allies. A great scientist of the mind. He claims to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">528	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tuned in on you today as you flew this way. May I ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">why you wanted him to meet you, in your room at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brettner could only tell the truth, astonished as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was. He knew that, if this mental science had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">so developed as to reveal what was upon his mind at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a given hour, they were likely to know the rest of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">message.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wanted to have him help me obtain the release of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Deneen," he admitted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are an honest man," said the Grand Master</seg><seg type="columnLine">with cynicism. He leaned backward in his chair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked toward the ceiling, then straightened with deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mination: "Go ashore with your pilot--No. 313, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Return to your room in the hotel. The pilot will</seg><seg type="columnLine">there meet Gastro, whom you perhaps have already</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspected as my agent. You are not to return until after</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have obtained from Metter a few pounds of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive tablets. You are to telephone, as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">instructions to do so are given you, and make an ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointment to meet him. You will tell him you require</seg><seg type="columnLine">this explosive to bombard a shoal out in the Pacific, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus create an island where you can have a little place</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your own. It sounds like a weird story; but it has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been done. I am confident that he will let you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the explosive. It is the only one which will serve the</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose of the great mission; the particulars of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are to know when you have returned and reported</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me. I am going to give you five thousand pieces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">International gold with which to pay Metter. You may</seg><seg type="columnLine">depart within an hour. Remember, if anything tran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spires which shows you to be a traitor to us--and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">your sweetheart--it will mean death to both of you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brettner rose quickly from his lounge, feeling much</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger. Apparently not in the least concerned by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last words of the Grand Master, he was inwardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled, however; for with Professor Ray following</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mental trail he dared not make a tangible plan. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed that his fate was sealed. But he then remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered how the professor had told him of the art of</seg><seg type="columnLine">placing his mind out of focus, so that none save him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self could know his thoughts. And, if he could accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plish that, then Professor Ray who had chosen to join</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "Conquerors of the World" might prove his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">undoing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This Grand Master is a resourceful character," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, while he was being helped outside, and into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room where a white-shirted physician was to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amine him and fit him for "the great mission."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Knowing that not only the fate of Nadia and himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">depended on his ability to conquer Marino, Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brettner was at a loss to steady himself for the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordeal which he must soon face. However, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths of his mind, there lay a message that vaguely</seg><seg type="columnLine">conveyed some hope. The thing was not definite, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">his intuitions were strong; as were the intuitions of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">educated and refined people of his day. And he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">this plan that was still incubating beneath his con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness would come to success, in some manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That evening found Fred Brettner again in his hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, where he waited, more or less anxiously, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">return of pilot No. 313. The latter had brought him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the airport near Los Angeles, and escorted him all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to his room; then left with the assurance that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would return as soon as Gastro had taken possession of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room next to his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Fred opened the door for a peep down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aisle, and saw Gastro enter the room next to his own,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sudden inspiration seized him. He remembered the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> orders which had been given him--to converse with</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one. He imagined this applied to such individuals</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Gastro, as well as to those not associated with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Order. So he suppressed his desire to spring at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">traitor's throat, and stepped quickly back into his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not close the door tightly, though, but stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">there waiting for the appearance of the pilot who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to return and give him the word to telephone Metter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had a conviction that the pilot would first talk with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gastro--and so overhearing any conversation between</seg><seg type="columnLine">them would be of benefit. So he was waiting close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door, when he heard footsteps come past to Gastro's</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, and a soft knock. Fred heard Gastro open the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, and heard it close again. He opened his own door</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly to see if the pilot had entered Gastro's room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Concluding that he had, Fred stepped softly to the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the other room and bent down to listen. He heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pilot ask Gastro to get something from the dresser.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The latter turned around apparently to obey and in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, through the keyhole, Fred saw the pilot whip</seg><seg type="columnLine">something from his pocket. It was a strangely-shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon--"the Radium-Ray pistol which kills instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">without loss of blood," Brettner thought horrified. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he could open the door and spring upon the assassin</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter had turned the weapon upon Gastro. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a silent, bluish flash and the dispatcher wilted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor and lay still. Then reason left Brettner. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sight of this atrocious act he forgot the danger that</seg><seg type="columnLine">menaced himself, Nadia and the world. He swung open</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door, threw himself upon the back of the murderer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gave his arm a sudden wrench which sent the gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">spinning into the corner. The big pilot turned upon him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and showered a rain 'of blows with his free hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">squarely on Fred's face. But the latter, in his fury,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove his own fist into the body and face of the pilot as</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast and hard as he could strike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Round and round they struggled. Once, in the tur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moil of it all, Fred felt himself weakening. But a pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of Nadia came to him, with all the radiance of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile and, again, all the bitterness in her look the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he had seen her. These "Conquerors of the World,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">were ruthless pirates. His own pal, Joe Blaine, innocent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all intrigue, had been murdered by them. He must</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcome this man. Yet the pilot was crowding him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and working him around, in order to get at the pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">which lay near Gastro's body. Brettner realized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact and himself struggled for the position which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot had tried to gain. And, when once he had forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">his opponent's back against the wall, the grim determina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the unbeatable fighter filled him. He continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">to exchange blows now with a renewed fierceness. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconquerable soul dominated him. Yet an unexpected</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow unbalanced him, and he found himself on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and knees on the floor, the pilot leaped to get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol. A prayer ran through Fred's mind; he himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">was willing to die, but now in his hands might lie the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate of the world. He hurled himself in a flying leap</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the knees of his antagonist; it was the perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">tackle, not forgotten since his college days, and the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">man crushed to the floor. His head struck the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bed and he lay still, an ugly wound in his temple.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The blow had been fatal. Fred bent down, felt of bis</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart; it was still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no time to lose; he hurriedly closed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, locked it, and returned to his own room. Quickly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he washed the blood from his hands and face, hurriedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed his suit and was ready for further action. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the door and then looked down the hallway;</seg><seg type="columnLine">FREEDOM OF THE SKIES	529</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed, fortunately, that no one had heard the fight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So he again opened the door of Gastro's room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered. The killing of the dispatcher puzzled him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wished to discover its meaning. Searching the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes he came upon a curious little badge; it was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the United States Secret Service! So that was it!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gastro, in the employ of the government, had been out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">witted, decoyed to this room, and put out of the way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he could not waste time over that. He had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission--to telephone for Metter. In the telephoto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone he saw the face of a Japanese servant, and asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the scientist:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is out of the country, Sir," spoke the servant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I do not expect him back here for a week."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are any of his colleagues here?" asked Fred, sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly frightened. He was thinking of what would</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen to Nadia if he could not promptly return with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pills of explosive to the Grand Master.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They have accompanied him," answered the servant:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Can I help you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Fred: "I am going to ask you to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">something for me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The face of the Japanese was expectant and pleasant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whereupon Brettner outlined his needs. The face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the servant was wreathed in a smile. He hesitated a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. Brettner smiled and added: "And there's five</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand pieces of International gold for you if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrive here within thirty minutes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The servant agreed instantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While waiting for the man's arrival Fred examined</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weapon, making certain that he could operate it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he put it into the carton in which he had carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gold, placing the money on the bed. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Japanese arrived, Fred greeted him with enthusiasm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and an apparently light heart, exchanged the money</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the package of tiny white pills which had cost many</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives, and might cost so many more; and bade the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">adieu with a feeling of relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No words of explanation had been necessary. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been in the eyes of the Jap a strange light of</seg><seg type="columnLine">humor--a thing for which Fred could not account until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he looked into the mirror and saw how his face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">swollen. Perhaps he could offer an excuse to the Grand</seg><seg type="columnLine">Master, he thought. So he switched off the lights and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried from the hotel. He wondered where to go next,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what to do. Perhaps he could find the course by com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass. But, if he could get a plane through the Order,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the automatic course-indicator would take him there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reentering Gastro's room, he walked over to the pilot's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body and ripped from the inside of the man's blouse a</seg><seg type="columnLine">green and white ribbon; that was evidently the sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Order. So he drove out hastily to the tiny field,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the ships of the Order had always landed, and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">displaying the ribbon was give a choice of planes. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">one in which he had arrived was waiting there, headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the wind, so Brettner chose that. Ten seconds later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was off to Marino.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four hours later, while dawn was rising in the East,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw the indicator settle to zero, and knew he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">again over the floating nation. He nosed down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">searched the ocean about him until finally he discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deck of the great submarine. Then he leveled off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">circling a mile away, while he contemplated his next</seg><seg type="columnLine">move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he thought again of Professor Ray. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered if the mental expert had discovered what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened. By means of what he had learned, he be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved that he had closed his mind to the professor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But what if he had failed?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The brightening sky had surely revealed his plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">to those below. He dared not wait longer. He nosed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and let out the pontoons until the little plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled quietly in the water near the edge of the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marine. Her pontoons held her there until Fred cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and found himself on deck. He looked about him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but discovered no one. Guards always waited at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing places on deck; it would seem that an amphibian</seg><seg type="columnLine">never landed in the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Apparently, too, the Grand Master was ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">move the great structure upon a minute's notice. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly this seemed to happen, in an unexpected way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A great stream of men suddenly emerged through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatchway, perhaps a quarter of a mile away, and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting. Then the elevators brought up plane after</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane, and into each of these climbed two men. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes took their positions in line at the further end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deck. The silence of the motors was weird, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whirr of the propellers was fantastic to Fred. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was frozen in his tracks for a moment, until he recalled</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the ordeal through which he had passed. And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he slid down a hatch and hurried toward the room of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Grand Master. When he arrived, and convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the orderly at the door that the packages contained</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the Grand Master had been waiting for, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ushered into the antechamber; where he had to wait for</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a short time. He listened to the voices in the Grand</seg><seg type="columnLine">Master's office. When the orderly announced him, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the Grand Master say, "Yes, yes--Bring him in."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fred laughed silently. A flash of intuition revealed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, that the Grand Master was in immediate need of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sympathy and assurance; that the agony of a troubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscience for having sent a hundred or more of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world's finest citizens to a terrible death, was eating</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the vitals of the super-criminal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Brettner steeled himself. It was the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time in his life when he felt the desirability of a stimu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lant ; for he was, by nature, almost totally incapable of</seg><seg type="columnLine">deception. But his plans were made and he must follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. He was surprised at his own resolution when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the orderly escorted him again into the presence of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grand Master. A coolness born of desperation had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come over him and he faced the great pirate with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">boyish smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Grand Master was grave. "I am glad you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">reported on time," he said: "You have been in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle?" he added as he surveyed Fred's features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fred saluted: "To execute your orders, Your Ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellency, I was forced to defend the explosives which</seg><seg type="columnLine">you ordered. Gastro had turned traitor and killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot 313, and in turn I killed Gastro with the pilot's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Radium-Ray gun. On Gastro's body I found the badge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the United States Secrct Service. The bodies are</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaiting discovery at the hotel. Of course I cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">return for I will be accused of their murder. I trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am safe in your protection."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Grand Master studied Fred's face a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then directed a series of searching questions at our</seg><seg type="columnLine">hero. Whereupon Fred related an ingenious tale of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his suspecting Gastro, and the latter's attempt to gain</seg><seg type="columnLine">possession of the explosives; the ensuing struggle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the killings. "I had your orders to bring them here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and here they are." He placed the dangerous packages</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the desk and stood at attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Grand Master smiled again, reassuringly: "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">have proved yourself," he said. He pressed a button,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his orderly entered the room. Then he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to Brettner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">(Continued on page 557)</seg><seg type="columnLine">(llluitratioH by Winter)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                The austere Mr. Maxwell rushed to save the machine and Mr. Treat rushed to save his cat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                and both arrived just as the cat let go and landed in a mad scramble on the faces and heads</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of these two gentlemen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">530</seg><seg type="columnLine">FLANNELCAKE'S INVENTION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ORACE TREAT, of Treat, Trout andstarting glider clubs in different districts, and by his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           Treat Corporation, Fiscal Agents, looked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           up as his secretary entered the private</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">             "That crack-pot inventor is out here</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">again, and he says that he is not going away until he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sees you," she announced, indifferently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, dammit, send him in and let's get the torture</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over with."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The girl started ofl^^ut was almost knocked over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the door by that "crackpot inventor" as he dashed in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Glad to see you, Mr. Treat, I'm Joe Flannelcake</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the Sunset Aviation Club.

At this point the gear stop took</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect, the rear prop ceased turning, and the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to circle the room in a curiously lame fashion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rear end hung slightly downward, and the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine wobbled back and forth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see," commenced Joe, "I will have to put a</seg><seg type="columnLine">model of the Jenkins' reversible propeller on the rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">end, which will reverse after the machine has lifted;</seg><seg type="columnLine">this will push, and keep the rear end level. I shall also</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrange to have the wings level out automatically, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising so that it will fly faster."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The craft remained in the air about a minute and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half, and then gradually settled downward as the spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound down. About a foot from the floor, the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine suddenly went into a side-slip, and landed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner on top of Mr. Treat's Maltese tomcat. The cat</seg><seg type="columnLine">made several passes at it before Joe rescued the plane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the cat growled ominously; it apparently thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the score hadn't been settled yet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Treat arose with a broad smile and extended his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, my boy, it isn't much, but it seems to work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll tell you; get the thing fixed up, and be around here</seg><seg type="columnLine">next Saturday afternoon.

Mr. Treat, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxwell, several reporters and a photographer were</seg><seg type="columnLine">there to see the "latest" in aircraft. Mr. Joseph Flan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nelcake proudly displayed a model plane, powered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">two miniature gasoline engines manufactured from</seg><seg type="columnLine">cartridge shells. It was about four feet in length, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of about the same wing spread.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Mr. Treat, where shall we try it out? said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'd better try it outside; it's too big for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not at all, Mr. Treat. The machine can be con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trolled perfectly, and besides, the wind is too strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hmmm! Well, let's take it into the reception room</seg><seg type="columnLine">then; but if it breaks anything, I'll break your neck."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The reception room of the Treat mansion was of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ballroom dimensions; it was high-ceilinged, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">adorned with pictures, vases, and bric-a-brac of artistic</seg><seg type="columnLine">or antique design.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe placed his machine on the floor, and made adjust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments on the rudder and on the gears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have here, gentlemen," he began, "a true model</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what the ideal plane should be. It is equipped with</seg><seg type="columnLine">reversing propellers, adjustable wings, and automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabilizers. Now, gentlemen, this machine is fool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proof ; it is so constructed, that it is impossible to 'crack</seg><seg type="columnLine">up' in it. It cannot go into a tail-spin, because it has</seg><seg type="columnLine">no tail; it cannot nose-dive, because of the adjustable</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings; it can side-slip, but its perfect balance will cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to right itself. It has no landing wheels, because it</seg><seg type="columnLine">can travel straight up or down, and needs none. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">can stop, start, and go backwards while in the air. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't have an automobile that had no reverse in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it, would you? Then why have an airplane-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will you please stop that salesmanship, and start</seg><seg type="columnLine">that thing going?" broke in Mr. Treat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe started each of the tiny motors by winding a</seg><seg type="columnLine">string around a projecting shaft, and pulling on it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They sputtered a bit, but soon commenced to idle beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tifully, emitting a noise like an outboard motor in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine little motors, these," he said. "Made 'em out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 'forty-five' shells; a piece of string from the gas</seg><seg type="columnLine">tank to the manifold serves as a carburetor, capillary</seg><seg type="columnLine">attraction, just like a lamp wick. Yes sir, this little</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat will go straight up; just an application of mechan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ics, you know. Same thing as if you take an auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobile, and go up a hill that is fifty feet high. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">car will do it nicely; but if you should attempt to climb</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pole of the same height, you couldn't do it. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">because the car hasn't the power, but because it is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">harnessed right. Now, if you would put a drum of</seg><seg type="columnLine">small diameter on the rear axle, and wrap a cable</seg><seg type="columnLine">around it, and tie the cable to the top of the pole, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car could be made to pull its own weight off the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Similarly, with the plane, the motor will ultimately get</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to a certain height; then, why not straight up?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The audience was becoming impatient; that is, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a 'newspaper man, who was inspecting one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motors, oblivious of Joe's speech. Said Mr. Maxwell:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Never mind about all that. Start the thing off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe moved a small lever on the back of the machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which caused the motors to speed up to a more or less</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneven roar. He then removed his hand from the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it and stepped back. The machine floundered about</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a bit, like a moth that has been burnt in a candle</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame, and then lifted slightly from the floor. It slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and forth like a piece of cardboard in a high wind;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then rose vertically into the air. A cloud of pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue smoke eddied up with it, making it resemble a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinwheel. The exhaust pipes threw a pretty little flame,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the thing was under way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Watch, my friends, the propeller is about to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse," cried Joe above the noise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, sure enough, the rear blades whined a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and changed their pitch. The rear wings also adjusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves to the angle of the front ones, instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite, and the machine started at a good rate around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room. It circled once perfectly, and the room was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to smoke up quite a bit, when Mrs. Treat</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the room, and, with a statement about smoking</seg><seg type="columnLine">up her valuable tapestries, ordered the butler to open</seg><seg type="columnLine">a window.</seg><seg type="columnLine">FLANNELCAKE'S INVENTION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">533</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The window was opened; and when the plane made</seg><seg type="columnLine">its next revolution, it was forced downward by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">draft. It had been circling just over everybody's heads;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but now it came down, and just skudded over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorgeous chesterfield on the far side of the room. Up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">to this time no one had noticed that the Maltese was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reclining on the said chesterfield; but as the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed over it, the cat made a springing leap for it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunk the claws of both forefeet into the fuselage. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft had considerable momentum; it yanked the cat</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the air, and then banked sharply upward from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">added weight on the rear, like a big bird fighting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildcat. The austere Mr. Maxwell rushed to save the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine, and Mr. Treat rushed to save his cat; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">both arrived just as the cat let go and landed in a mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">scramble on the faces and heads of those two gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men ! The infuriated cat clawed deep furrows in Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxwell's bald pate with its front paws, while its</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind legs were gaining good traction in Mr. Treat's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth and nostrils.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Juggernaut</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE plane, released from its unwelcome passenger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued upward at its same sharp angle. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">first thing encountered in its line of travel was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">expensive, glass-prism bedecked chandelier, which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck vigorously. The rear propeller sustained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of the machine, while the front one merrily</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot glass pendants all around the room. Soon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine cut its way through and the remainder of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixture crashed down to the floor. Above the groans</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Treat and Maxwell, who were bleeding from many</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratches, the voice of Joe, happy as usual, could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard. He was talking to the photographer, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting his camera ana enjoying the scene immensely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That proves the durability of my ship. It is prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically wreck-proof. The machine is perfect."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the machine wasn't as perfect as it might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been. Its control wires were severed, for it now pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sued an erratic course around the room, scraping walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dousing everything with the oil and gasoline that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were exuding through several gashes in its body. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">butler dashed out of the room, and Mrs. Treat ran to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rescue of her bleeding husband. She was stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">half way, however, by the flying machine, which struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">her squarely on the back of the head; and the front</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">prop proceeded to tear out her hair. She fought it off</seg><seg type="columnLine">madly, and succeeded in throwing the machine back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward into the air. It veered around, boomerang</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion, and then it shot over the photographer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, smearing his face with oil. He reeled over back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards, and went down with the reporters like pins in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bowling alley; accidentally discharging his flashlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun. With a smart explosion and cloud of smoke, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">efficiently set fire to the gasoline that the plane had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprayed around. The room was in a turmoil when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">butler returned with a shotgun and aimed at the plane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which now had one propeller in the goldfish aquarium,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossing water and fish about the place. The aquarium</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke open, and the plane again took the air, just as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">butler let both barrels go. He missed the ship, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">took most of the tapestries and plaster from one side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room. Joe Flannelcake, trying to catch his brain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">child, was desperately running around the room, step-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping and falling over everybody. How long pande-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monium would have reigned is not known, if it were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not for a lucky circumstance in the flight of the ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For no reason at all. the plane suddenly started to fly</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight--yes, straight for the large bay window at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the room. As a fitting climax to its reign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror, it crashed loudly through the glass. Joe fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed it to the window, and gazed wistfully after it as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strong breeze through the Golden Gate carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plane into the waters of the bay. He watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot where it had disappeared, totally unmindful of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room behind him, which was now burning furiously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was awakened from his coma by the arrival of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire department; and, when he went through the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow to the street, he was met by an angry group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood-spattered men.

Twice each</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, at dawn and at dusk, our door was opened by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards that brought our food, that food being as in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own air-cities the paste-like synthetic compounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of artificial proteins and fats and carbohydrates which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had decades before replaced the old natural foods. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">though our door was thus flung open twice each day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no hope of escape for us in that fact. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two guards who brought our food in to us carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">their heat-pistols always in one hand, and always, night</seg><seg type="columnLine">and day, there watched in the corridor outside a full</seg><seg type="columnLine">score of similarly armed guards by whom one could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hope to pass living toward the cage-lifts. It seem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed indeed, as Connell had said, that weeks of frenzied</seg><seg type="columnLine">meditation could never disclose any plausible plan of</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape, and so I lapsed with him into a state of half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lassitude that had been induced by our utter despair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so days passed. Not even the prospect of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own deaths which I knew to be looming before us, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient to rouse me from that lassitude, not even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that at the end of that fortnight, as I had guessed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great attack of the air-cities was to be launched</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the American Federation, and that it was for</seg><seg type="columnLine">that reason that our captors had given us that time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Connell, Macklin, myself--we three had faced in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">time perils and risks enough, but so overwhelming was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doom that hung over us and over our nation now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it stunned us, held us in stupefied despair. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of us there was that was not so stunned, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Hilliard, my young second officer. His eager,</seg><seg type="columnLine">restive nature, chafing at our imprisonment and at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that was looming for our land, resisted stub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bornly the deep hopelessness that had settled upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of us, and hour after hour he spent in pacing about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little cell, or in striving to devise some means for</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaping from it. And at last, upon the fourth day</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our imprisonment there in the tower, he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly toward us with an eager cry upon his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Daring Venture</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"T HAVE it!" he exclaimed. "A way that two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">| us can win free with--and maybe all! A chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of millions, with death at the end of it, maybe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a chance to get Connell and his secret back j"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how?" I questioned. "How can two of us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even, get clear of this cell ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The guards!" he exclaimed excitedly. "The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards that bring our food each dawn and dusk--if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can overpower them--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's useless, Hilliard," I said. "Even if we did</seg><seg type="columnLine">overpower them we could not pass the score of other</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards in the corridor outside, or the scores of others</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its lower floors."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But listen," he appealed, and then, as he went on to</seg><seg type="columnLine">detail to us the plan that he had devised, I felt some</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight measure of hope rising within me, saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawning hope reflected in the faces of Connell and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Macklin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a chance!" he exclaimed. "And if we can do</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, if I can get back to our own land, it means a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">still for the American Federation! For the European</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Asiatic Federations won't be starting their at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack for another ten days or more, their preparations</seg><seg type="columnLine">not finished till then, and in that time by bending every</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort toward it our own engineers could put the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube-propellers in all our American air-cities! Could</seg><seg type="columnLine">make those cities able to meet the enemy cities, attack</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">when it comes!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, with that foremost in mind, we swiftly decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">that upon that very evening, when our guards brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">our food at dusk, we would put the plan into operation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would stake everything upon it. For even if but two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us could escape by it, if Connell could be one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those two, and could get back across the Atlantic with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tremendous secret, it meant a fighting-chance for</seg><seg type="columnLine">our Federation. And with that in mind the rest of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">were willing to take all chances, to dare all risks. Risky</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough the thing would be, we knew, all depending</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon what occurred in one moment of rushing action,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and numberless were the features of it that might go</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely wrong and ruin us. But we steeled ourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the thought of what would become of our Feder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation if we failed. And so ready and tense with re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solution we waited for the coming of dusk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To me, through the remaining hours of that day, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed that never had the sun sunk westward so slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. From our window we could see all the activities</seg><seg type="columnLine">that went on in the great air-city about us, could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">far across all this great mass of towers and streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thronging crowds which hung here miles in the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the earth, and could see those activities lessen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing somewhat as the long shadows of sunset fell across</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow streets and smooth plazas. In the great plaza</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath, at the foot of that electrostatic tower in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were imprisoned, there rested always a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">great cruisers of the European fleet, reporting to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">First Air Chief there in the tower's base, and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the approach of night other cruisers from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarming masses above the city were slanting down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest upon the plaza. And these cruisers we watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">with intent gaze as the sunset's light declined.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outside in the corridor we could hear the oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casional movement of feet as the score of guards there</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved about now and then, but heard not the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching feet of the two that brought our food. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they were not to come upon this evening? Or what</seg><seg type="columnLine">if more than two, or less than two, were to come?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Either contingency would be equally ruinous to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan, and with the passing of each moment we sat in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an increasing agony of expectation, Connell's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning, Macklin as imperturbable as ever, Hilliard</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager and tense. Then at last, when the shadows of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dusk were falling across the great city of the air out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, were deepening in our little cell, we heard voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside, the greetings of our guards in the corridor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then a moment later the solid metal door of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">cell had clicked open. Then into the cell stepped our</seg><seg type="columnLine">two usual guards with our food, their heat-pistols ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">as always in their right hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The eyes of one warily upon us, the other took both</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the metal containers of synthetic food and reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">to place them, as usual, upon the lower bunk-rack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the room's right hand side. Macklin was lying upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">that bunk-rack having stretched himself out as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping. The rest of us were lounging at the cell's</seg><seg type="columnLine">other side, the second guard's heat-pistol watchfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon us while the first reached toward the bunk-rack to</seg><seg type="columnLine">place the metal food-containers beside the supposedly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping Macklin's head. But as lie placed them there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he began to turn away from it, Macklin's hands shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly behind his head as he lay there and grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arm of the first guard in a single movement, jerking</seg><seg type="columnLine">him toward the bunk-rack! Like lightning the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard turned with his pistol toward that sudden move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and as he did so, forgetful for the instant of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of us, we three had leaped upon him! And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Hilliard and I bore the second guard to the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">CITIES IN THE AIR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">537</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wrenching the pistol from him, Macklin and Connell had</seg><seg type="columnLine">jammed the first one against the cell's corner, with hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon his mouth, and had him equally powerless!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whole swift scene of action had taken but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashing moment to carry out, and so lightning-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been our movements, so careful above all had we</seg><seg type="columnLine">been to gag with our hands the two guards as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped them, that no single sound save for a few low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">choking gasps had come from them. And then, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hands over their mouths and with all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength of our muscles Hilliard and I held the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards, Macklin and Connell were swiftly stripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">their tight-jacketed green uniforms from them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment more, and Connell and Macklin were</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly doffing their own black uniforms of the Amer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ican Federation and donning the green ones. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a restless movement of feet in the corridor with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, and with the speed of utter necessity we took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two discarded black uniforms and forced them upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two guards, holding them still voiceless and power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less. Then, that done, the two guards were as like</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their black uniforms as Hilliard and myself; with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Connell and Macklin, the latter having been chosen</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of the similarity of his appearance to one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guards, wearing now the guards' green uniforms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And now the very climax of our endeavor was come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that moment upon which depended all, for now, sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly removing our hands from the lips of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards we held, we added our own sudden cries to</seg><seg type="columnLine">theirs, and at the same moment Connell and Macklin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their green uniforms, were engaging in a mock</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle with us and with our guards, whose din seem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed terrific there in the quiet upper levels of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly as those cries arose there was a rush of</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet outside and the score of guards there poured down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corridor and through the cell's door, to see four</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us in black uniforms struggling apparently with</seg><seg type="columnLine">two green-uniformed guards, who were in reality Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nell and Macklin. It was the moment upon which all</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested, and in that moment the score of guards acted</seg><seg type="columnLine">as- Hilliard had foreseen, gazing not in that wild mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of frenzied action at faces but at uniforms, see-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing only in that first moment in the dusky cell four</seg><seg type="columnLine">black-garbed men struggling with two green-garbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones they had seen enter it but moments before. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing this, they rushed upon us four black-uniformed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones, Hilliard and myself and the guards whom in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guise of aiding in the struggle we had held, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to beat us back against the cell's end, totally</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgetting in that moment the two green-uniformed</seg><seg type="columnLine">men they were succoring! And in that moment, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they pressed us back, Connell and Macklin were steal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing swiftly out of the cell, and down the corridor</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the hall of the cage-lifts!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For but a moment more did we struggle with our</seg><seg type="columnLine">outnumbering opponents there, and then as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped and held the four of us helpless and jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">our heads up wild cries came from them as they saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faces of us, saw that two of us were their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards! Then the next moment, needing no other ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planation of what had happened, they turned with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own black-garbed fellows, rushed out of the cell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slamming shut its door behind them, down the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridor and toward the cage-lifts after Connell and Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">klin! We heard those cries re-echoed swiftly over all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mighty building, heard rushing feet and repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">calls on the levels of the great tower above and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath us. And then, as we flung ourselves to our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">window, gazed downward, we saw in the next mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment two green-garbed tiny figures issuing from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant electrostatic tower's base far beneath us, run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning across the great plaza toward the nearest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruisers. They were Connell and Macklin!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I cried out with Hilliard hoarse words of encourage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, forgetful that none could hear from our ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rific height, saw Connell and Macklin rushing up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender gangplank in the cruiser's side and through its</seg><seg type="columnLine">open door, saw that door dam shut behind them, just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the base of the tower there poured out after</seg><seg type="columnLine">them a flood of pursuing green-garbed figures. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuers were raising their heat-pistols, and a hail of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining heat-cartridges were flying through the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the cruiser in the next moment, but as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot toward it there came faintly up to us the dron-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the ship's great motors and then with all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of those motors in its vertical lifting tube-prop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ellers it was rising upward, was lifting smoothly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly upward toward us! And at the same moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">the green-uniformed crowd of guards beneath were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing across the plaza toward the other resting</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruisers, were rushing within them to soar up after</seg><seg type="columnLine">Connell and Macklin!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up toward us shot the lifting cruiser of our two</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends, though, up toward our little window, for such</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been our plan by which two, escaping, might</seg><seg type="columnLine">rescue the remaining two. But as it shot upward I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked down, saw beneath the scores of cruisers on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plaza rising now after it, heard through all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great tower and for far around it a great roar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising shouts as the escape was discovered, saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant gleaming muzzles of the great batteries of heat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns around the plaza turning swiftly upward on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">pivots toward the rising cruiser of Connell and Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">klin! And so the next moment as that cruiser shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">up toward us, as I made out Macklin plain in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">transparent-windowed bridge-room, driving it up to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward us, I flung an arm outward from the tower to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, shouting in frenzied appeal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Back, Macklin!" I cried, with Hilliard crying too</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside me, "No time to get us--back home with Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nell, for God's sake!''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw my frenzied gesture westward, caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning of my wild warning shout as the guns be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath swung toward him and the cruisers below rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, and I saw him hang there for a fraction of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment irresolute, hesitating. Then the next moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as there came a swift-spreading thunder of deton-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ations from the great heat-guns around the plaza he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had whirled the wheel over and sent the great cruiser</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing away from the tower, sent it rushing westward</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the dusk above the great air-city's gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights. In the next instant there shot through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air where it had been the shining heat-shells from be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath! And then as Macklin's cruiser rushed comet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like onward through the dusk the great heat-guns be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath were turning again toward it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I cried out hoarsely as they thundered again, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a whirl sidewise Macklin and Connell had</seg><seg type="columnLine">evaded the rushing shells and were hurtling on. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">over all the great air-city, over all the mighty mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berlin was spreading a roar of alarm, and now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruisers that had rushed up in pursuit were rocketing</seg><seg type="columnLine">westward after that single fleeing one, the batteries be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath us holding their fire lest they strike their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuing ships. With our hearts pounding Hilliard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I saw that single little cruiser leap on, saw it shoot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through the dusk until its gleaming shape was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">far away from the great air-city, racing westward!</seg><seg type="columnLine">538	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Swiftly, though, the numberless pursuing cruisers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">converging upon it, and then, as we strained our eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see the flying gleaming craft, there came a greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">thundering of guns as all the suddenly-alarmed bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teries at the air-city's westward edge loosed their shells</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the fleeing cruiser! That cruiser seemed to halt</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment unaccountably, there was a great blind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing flare that could be made only by heat-shells strik-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and then the cruiser, the cruiser that held Macklin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Connell and' all the American Federation's fate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was reeling blindly downward and out of sight, whirl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing lifelessly downward toward the earth far below!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Great Movement Start9</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STUNNED and stupefied, Hilliard and I gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in that moment from our wmdow, out through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dusk above the air-city to where the cruiser</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our two friends had plunged to death.

The wild break for freedom that two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us had made and that had ended in those two's</seg><seg type="columnLine">dest uction, had apparently not changed the plans of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the European First Air Chief in regard to us, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that at the end of the designated fortnight, less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ten days hence now, we must either reveal all our</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of the American forces, which we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not do, or suffer death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We knw^. too, that even as Connell had guessed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was at tnfe end of that fortnight, ten days hence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the European and Asiatic Federations planned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">launch their final gigantic attack of air-cities, since it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was evident that they wished to gain their information</seg><seg type="columnLine">from us only to use it immediately in their attack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For now below, in the city's base-compartments, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great new tube-propellers that were to whirl it through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air at such terrific speed were being completed, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, as in all the two hundred air-cities of the Euro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pean and Asiatic Federations. The long months of</seg><seg type="columnLine">experimentation over, it needed but weeks or days to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush those new tube-propellers into place. And had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Connell escaped with his secret it might well have been,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought, that even in the ten days left the new-type</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes could have been swiftly manufactured by thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands and placed in all our own American air-cities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If Connell had escaped! But Connell had not es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caped, Connell had plunged to death with Macklin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">amid the flaring heat-shells. Prisoned there in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">little cell, Hilliard and I despite that ever-approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">doom almost paid no attention whatever to all out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side and about us, brooding there in silence hour upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour as night followed day and day night. We had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not, even, the slightest further thoughts of escape,</seg><seg type="columnLine">altho such thoughts would have been hopeless, for now</seg><seg type="columnLine">our door was never opened save by the full score of</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed guards outside. So, losing all thought and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope of freedom, we sat on in our little prison high</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the mighty tower, dead to all the unceasing rush of</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparations and gathering of cruisers in the city about</seg><seg type="columnLine">us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But at last, upon the eighth day after the break of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Connell and Macklin, and the second day before our</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching doom, there came an event which roused</seg><seg type="columnLine">us suddenly from that renewed apathy into which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fallen. For days we had noticed that the crowds</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the streets were proving fewer and fewer, the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">people now remaining being groups of green-uni form-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed officials unceasingly moving in and out of the head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters there. There was finally made clear to us</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reason of their activities. For, as we gazed forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">from our window on the afternoon of that day, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to sense a certain air of anticipation in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people that remained. They swarmed forth into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great air-city's streets; we heard in a moment more a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange great hissing from far below us, all around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city's base and edge; and then were aware that with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hissing sound and with a great tremor of power</seg><seg type="columnLine">that beat through all its colossal metal mass, the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-city was moving! Was moving not slowly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">majestically as air-cities commonly move, but was</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaping forward through the air with sudden tremen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dous speed. We knew now that most of the city's</seg><seg type="columnLine">population had been removed to the ground and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement toward the west had started.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now came excited roars from the crowds beneath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the giant mass that was Berlin leapt forward, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now as Hilliard and I leaned from our window with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an excitement almost as great we caught our breaths.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For we could see now, from the cloud-masses that</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay beneath in the distance, that the great air-city was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleaving the air at a speed that was rapidly mounting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to over a hundred miles an hour. Terrific winds were</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling all about our power-tower, as it shot through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the atmosphere, and those same winds sweeping with</seg><seg type="columnLine">titanic force through the city's streets and about its</seg><seg type="columnLine">towers forced the crowds in those streets swiftly within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shelter of the structures. And still at ever-mount-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing speed, the hissing of power and the tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar of winds increasing still, the mighty air-city was</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling on, its soaring towers of metal swaying back</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the awful winds of their progress, whipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">through high cloud-banks and out into clear air again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving us flashing glimpses from our own wind-swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">window of the ground, far outward and beneath flash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing back at immense speed as we shot onward, as all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the colossal city sped on, at a velocity that I knew by</seg><seg type="columnLine">then must be over a hundred and fifty miles an hour!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A colossal city, speeding through earth's atmosphere!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Awed, despite ourselves, Hilliard and I clung at our</seg><seg type="columnLine">window there as with all else in the city we sped on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A colossal city five full miles in its diameter, with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">CITIES IN THE AIR	539</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">its works and streets and giant batteries of heat-guns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rushing above earth at a velocity seeming almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">unattainable! And even as we watched, we felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great city slanting upward with the same terrific speed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing swiftly upward until the air about us was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">but freezing and then diving down toward earth once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more on a long, gliding swoop! Then it had turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">in mid-air, was flashing back over its course, was go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through maneuver after maneuver until at last the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great hissing from its base ceased, and it hung at its</seg><seg type="columnLine">former height above the earth once more, the crowds</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its towers surging forth now to renew their excited</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Last Preparations</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HILLIARD and I gazed for a long moment at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. "The tube-propellers they were putting in</seg><seg type="columnLine">--finished--," he said slowly, "And Berlin ready now</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the great attack--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And all the other European Federation cities," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "and all those of the Asiatic Federation--all must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be nearly completed now, their new tube-propellers</seg><seg type="columnLine">installed also. And in two more days-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In two more days! It was the thought that beat ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer-like in my brain and in Hilliard's in those hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">that followed, those hours that were now closing down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one by one, upon the doom of ourselves and of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">our nation. Two more days! Two more days at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of which would have ended the fortnight of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">imprisonment, when would come for us the death that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had loomed larger and larger during each of those pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing days. Two more days at the end of which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great air-cities of the European and Asiatic Federations</seg><seg type="columnLine">would rush like whirlwinds over the oceans toward our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own slow-moving and helpless cities, to beat them down</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all the thunder of their giant batteries. Two more</seg><seg type="columnLine">days!-- and at the end of them for us and for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great air-cities and all the millions of the American</seg><seg type="columnLine">Federation, doom!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">following hours, Hilliard and I felt close about us the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intense despair that ever since the ill-fated attempt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Connell and Macklin had surrounded us. Through all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night following the first demonstration of the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense speed of the air-city, we sat awake, listening to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great shouts of triumph and exultation that came</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimly up to us from the crowds that remained in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets far beneath. The European Federation, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, already felt the glow of imminent victory that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this new speed of their great air-cities would give them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were exultant at the chance to annihilate com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely the hated American Federation. And, to ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complish that, the very last great preparations were</seg><seg type="columnLine">going on now in every part of the air-city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Great loads of shining heat-shells were being trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferred from the stores that had been brought to Berlin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the giant batteries of heat-guns around the city's</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge and its central plaza around the electrostatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower. The cruisers of the European battle-fleet, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">some two thousand in number, were resting on all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing plazas, and were being cared for and inspected</seg><seg type="columnLine">by hordes of green-uniformed attendants. All other</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-craft were lowered into the great city's base-hangars</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be out of the way during the oncoming combat. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stroke of genius on the part of Berlin's commander,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power of the great air-forts had been added to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the city itself, by simply placing the air-forts here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there on unused landing plazas, where they formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in effect great armored gun-turrets on the city's sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. And, finally, the mighty city's speed and power</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to maneuver had been tested rigorously. With all its</seg><seg type="columnLine">peoples inside its metal towers, it was shot at terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed low and high above the earth; turning and dip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping and rising at that awful velocity like a flashing air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane rather than a gigantic city of the magnitude it</seg><seg type="columnLine">really had.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through all the hours of that night, and the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">day (the thirteenth of our imprisonment) those great</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparations, that unceasing rush of excited activity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued. Night came, and still the last preparations</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to be made; magazines were being filled, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">green-uniformed figures were swarming in countless</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers in the streets; going about their maneuvers;</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle-cruisers were moving ceaselessly across the sky.</seg><seg type="columnLine">During the hours of that night, as Hilliard and I sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent there, high above all the tremendous turmoil of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the streets and plazas below, we sometimes raised our</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes to watch also the calm, slow march of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">constellations across the sky above; glittering groups</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stars that seemed to look down with cool and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">temptuous eyes upon all this mad flurry of human ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citement and human endeavor. Dozing a little now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then, we sat there until at last dawn sent its rosy</seg><seg type="columnLine">light across the world. It was the last dawn, I knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Hilliard or I would look upon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, it seemed, all the preparations in the giant air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">city about us were completed. The crowds that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved in its streets during the day and night before</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained, but silent now with the thrill of approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">combat. Tense and silent the city remained, as the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">crept up toward the zenith through the morning hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that fateful day. And, high in our tower-cell, Hil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liard and I found ourselves gripped by the same tense</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling of anticipation. From our window as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the city, we made out the west, a dark spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing through the air toward Berlin, a spot that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing steadily larger in size, that was broadening</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into a large dark disk; and then as it came swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer we saw with astonishment that it was a city, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant air-city almost as large as Berlin itself!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Gathering of the Cities</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE heard a stir of excitement in the streets below</seg><seg type="columnLine">as that mighty air-city came closer to us; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw it slowing down until at last it had come smoothly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rest out to the south of Berlin, hanging there in mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">air a half dozen miles away. It was London! Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I had recognized it, Hilliard had done so also. Lon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don ! The great air-city that held all southern England</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the European Federation, could be clearly recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized, not only by its size but by the somewhat different</seg><seg type="columnLine">architectural design of its metal towers and plazas.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We could make out clearly now the surface of the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">city, its huge batteries of heat-guns, and its great tow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers surmounted by a central pinnacle. And now, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we scanned the horizon away to the north, we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see another dark disk, another mighty air-city, rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly toward us!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're gathering!" Hilliard's voice was agonized.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Gathering--all the air-cities of the European Federa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion ! It's the beginning of the end."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gathering for their great attack," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God. if Connell and Macklin could have escaped!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hilliard's cry burst from his tortured soul. "If our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own air-cities had only the speed and the power to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sist this attack!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Steady, Hilliard," I told him. my hand on his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der. "It's the end, I think--the end for our Federa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion as well as ourselves--but we must face it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Now the air-city from the north was rushing closer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">540	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was hanging northward of Berlin, and we saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was Stockholm. And, even as it came to rest out</seg><seg type="columnLine">there beside us, two other air-cities were rushing up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the south; looming larger swiftly and identifying</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves, when they too shot up to hang near our</seg><seg type="columnLine">central city, as Geneva and Rome. And then from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">west were coming others, Paris and Brussels and Am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sterdam; while down from the cold east were speeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moscow and Helsingfors.and Leningrad. City after</seg><seg type="columnLine">city was rushing from all quarters of the compass, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">every part of the European Federation, until they filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky. Through the hours of that afternoon we</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched their numbers grow until they numbered over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred. They had come from every part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, over which the European Federation held sway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the bleak eastern steppes, from the jagged peaks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and green valleys of the Pyrenees, from the great ice-</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked fiords of the north and from the blue plains ot</seg><seg type="columnLine">southern Africa, they were rushing at colossal speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to gather here in a great circle about their capital city--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berlin! Great air-cities, each of which flashed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air at the same tremendous speed, each of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore upon it great batteries of those giant heat-guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">that nothing else in the air could sustain, each of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">held upon it a soaring electrostatic tower and thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of other clustered pinnacles. As in Berlin, the crowd-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, seething millions of its peoples had been left on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground quarters prepared for them. The gathering</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cities! At last, with the coming of sunset, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the last few of the Federation's mighty air-cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gathered around Berlin!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By then, gazing out from our window high in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrostatic tower, Hilliard and I seemed to be looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">across a single gigantic city that stretched in mid-air</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far as the eye could reach, so closely were the scores</seg><seg type="columnLine">of great hovering air-cities hanging together! It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though we were looking forth across an endless plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of clustered towers of metal, from which rose here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there the higher pinnacle of a city's power-source; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">titanic plain of towers and streets of metal, crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with millions of the European Federation's soldiery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, as the blood-red sunset flamed eastward upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">all this huge assemblage, now waiting only for the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their number, something seemed to snap in my brain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all the stoicism which I had summoned to meet our</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate and our nation's fate abruptly vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can't stay here while doom rushes upon our</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation!" I cried madly. "Since they start out tonight</seg><seg type="columnLine">--since our time is up and we die ourselves tonight--</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll go to death fighting for our freedom!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, now, it was Hilliard who endeavored to calm</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. "It's useless, Brant," he said. "A few hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">more; then all will be rushing west while the Asiatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Federation is moving east upon our air-cities. And at</seg><seg type="columnLine">any moment now, before that attack starts, they will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming here for us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But they'll not take us to a death like that!" I ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed, a cold, long-repressed fury surging up within</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. "If we're to die we'll do it, striking a blow at our</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a caged tiger I paced the little cell's interior,</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing shadowy and dusky now; the sun had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared. From the corridor outside came the voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the guards, and at any moment I expected the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">to swing open and admit those who would take us to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">last examination at which our silence would bring im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediate death. Already, far out over the great mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of scores upon scores of giant air-cities that filled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air about us, a great, complicated pattern of brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights was gleaming through the deepened twilight; and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">now, from south and east and west, the last of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great European Federation's air-cities were assembling</seg><seg type="columnLine">about that tremendous gathered mass of cities. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I turned from the metal door which I had been ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amining in blind and futile rage, my eyes fell upon our</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunk-racks and the strong but slender strips of metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">that held them out from the metal wall, against which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were set diagonally. And, as I looked at them</seg><seg type="columnLine">an idea, a last flame of hope, burned into my brain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I turned swiftly to Hilliard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those strips of metal 1" I exclaimed, pointing toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. "Those bunk-supports--it's a chance to escape!</seg><seg type="columnLine">A chance that means death, Hilliard, I think--but death</seg><seg type="columnLine">is upon us now in any case--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swiftly, almost incoherently, I explained to him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea that had suggested itself to me. I heard his breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch as lie comprehended its appalling nature. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw his eyes gleam as he realized that, inasmuch as</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost certain death awaited us, death in escaping could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not deter us, for we were already doomed. So, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped one of the metal strips and tried with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">our force to tear its lower end loose from the metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. That lower end, set directly in the wall, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">integral with its metal; and, as we pulled upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal strip, gasping with our great effort, muscles tired,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we still kept on. We had to work quietly lest some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound betray us to the guards without. It seemed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could never tear it loose. Straightening from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">violent exertion, with dizzy heads, muscles aching, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused for a moment, then reached to grasp the strip</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, braced ourselves against the wall and exerted all</seg><seg type="columnLine">our force upon it. It held for a terrible moment, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to give, to bend--and then, with a little grating</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound, we had pulled the strip loose from the wall into</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it had been set.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           CHAPTER VIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           A Single Chance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">INTENTLY for a moment we listened without mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; but there came no sound of alarm from with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, nothing but the occasional voices of the guards.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And now we grasped another of the metal bunk-sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ports, and wrenched its metal strip loose from the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">with another tremendous effort. We had in our hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">two metal strips, each of some three feet in length.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These we now bent swiftly into two L's or right angles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of equal sides, using all our combined strength on each</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bend the strong metal. Then, swiftly loosening the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, strong leather belts that criss-crossed over our</seg><seg type="columnLine">black air-jackets, we formed of them swiftly two leather</seg><seg type="columnLine">ropes ten feet, in length. Each of these we attached</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one of our metal L's, making each fast to one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jagged, broken ends of one of the bent strips. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">panting from our swift efforts, we stood erect, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved toward our little window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Night lay over the world now, and from our window</seg><seg type="columnLine">we saw the cities illumined by their lights stretching</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to the horizon. On the landing plazas of the air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">city beneath us rested the great European Federation</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle-fleet. In the plaza directly beneath us, that which</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded the base of our great electrostatic tower,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there rested but a few score of cruisers, those of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">commanders who were now at the headquarters inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great tower's base. The plaza was practically de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted ; for it was the evening meal. For a moment I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood there at the window, gazing out over that tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous mass of giant air-cities. Then, summoning</seg><seg type="columnLine">all my courage, I flung my right leg over the window's</seg><seg type="columnLine">base, through its opening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CITIES IN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sitting astride that opening, while Hilliard watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiously behind me, I placed the metal angle I carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the flat metal sill of the window, one end of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle catching on the sill while the other end, to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">my leather rope was fastened, pointed straight down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward toward the great plaza a thousand feet beneath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, holding to that leather rope, I slid out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window's opening; and hung by my hands from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender rope with only empty air between me and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaza far below. Tensely I swung there in that mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, but the metal angle caught in the sill held my</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight. And so, sliding down the leather rope fastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it, I felt my feet strike in a moment against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sill of the window below. Another moment and I stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon that sill, crouching within that window's opening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The window in which I crouched opened into one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great upper corridors of the electrostatic tower;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I knew that to venture back into the building,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarming now with guards, was to meet death, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">did I plan to do so. Giving my leather rope a twitch,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I worked loose the angle resting on the sill above; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when that dropped toward me, I placed it on the sill</seg><seg type="columnLine">on which I stood, and the next moment was sliding</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the window below. And now above me Hil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liard, using his own metal angle and leather rope in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same way, was following me, was sliding from win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow to window after me, down the smooth side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty pinnacle to the street far below. Down--down</seg><seg type="columnLine">--like two strange insects we crept downward from</seg><seg type="columnLine">window to window. None in the streets below glimpsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two tiny shapes crawling down the mighty tower's</seg><seg type="columnLine">side; for the darkness had deepened now, and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaza directly beneath us there were none of the crowds</seg><seg type="columnLine">that swirled elsewhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our greatest danger, indeed, was that we would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen by someone inside the tower as we swung down</seg><seg type="columnLine">from window to window; and twice I was forced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hang for a few seconds from my leather rope above</seg><seg type="columnLine">a window inside which I could hear voices. Yet still</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and down we swung, praying that the regular</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of windows in the static-tower's side, extended</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbroken clear to its base; for otherwise we were lost.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Down and down we went, moving more hastily now</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite the awful hazards of our progress; so hastily</seg><seg type="columnLine">that once Hilliard's hook or angle slipped halfway out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the sill upon which it hung, and all but precipi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated him down to death before he could slide into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window beneath him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now we were within the last dozen levels of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaza's surface, and were down with all the eagerness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of renewed hope. For in the plaza there beneath us</seg><seg type="columnLine">there lay still the unguarded cruisers, their officers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crews gathered in the great tower down which we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">creeping. Another level--another--and down we swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the dusk, in such a descent as surely man never</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made before. The plaza was close beneath, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window of our cell now far above. From far around</seg><seg type="columnLine">that plaza, from Berlin and from all the air-cities about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we heard the great hum of final preparations being</seg><seg type="columnLine">made. I knew they were ready now to sally forth upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">their gigantic attack. But we were within the last few</seg><seg type="columnLine">levels of the plaza, now, swinging down with mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">haste from window to window toward its smooth sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. And then it was, when we were within a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards of that surface, that I heard a dim cry from</seg><seg type="columnLine">far above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Down now with all your strength, Hilliard I" I cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my friend above me. "They've come to our cell</seg><seg type="columnLine">after us--are giving the alarm!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The nearest cruiser there below!" he exclaimed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE AIR	541</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thickly as he swung madly down after me. "We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">make it yet!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now the cry of our guards high above was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken up and repeated by other voices in the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrostatic tower. That cry was coming down through</seg><seg type="columnLine">it from level to level, even as we swung from the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">window to the level plaza. And, as we staggered across</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, toward the open door of the nearest cruiser, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a series of popping detonations from above and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next moment little flares of terrific heat were burst-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing all about us as the guards shot their heat cartridges</seg><seg type="columnLine">down toward us! From their great height and through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dusk their aim was poor, and in a moment more</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were at the cruiser's open door. But now the alarm</seg><seg type="columnLine">was spreading over all the tower behind us, and at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same moment that we flung ourselves in through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruiser's open door, slamming it behind us, we heard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild clamor of voices from the power-tower's base!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next instant, though, we were bursting up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cruiser's bridge-room and for a moment of agony</seg><seg type="columnLine">I fumbled at its controls, set differently from those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our American cruisers. Then the motor-stud had</seg><seg type="columnLine">clicked beneath my fingers and, as the great electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">motors beneath droned suddenly loud with the current</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing through them, I sent all their power into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruiser's tube-propellers. Up it went rushing, up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">away at terrific speed and at a steep slant, even as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of green-uniformed figures burst from the electro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">static tower into the plaza! Out and over that plaza at</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific speed we shot, out and upward at such awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounting velocity that, before the great batteries of</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat-guns around us could turn, before the alarm from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power-tower had time to spread, we were whirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">tip and through the dusk over all the massed towers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gleaming lights of the great air-city Berlin!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out and over--and now as we soared upward into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rarefied levels of the air like a shooting-star, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruiser was driving outward over the cities, stabbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">westward through the air, literally chasing the sun that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had disappeared hours before. From Berlin behind us</seg><seg type="columnLine">there rose a hundred cruisers, soaring in swift and</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly pursuit! But so swift had been our rush, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">tardy had been the alarm of our escape, that before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great batteries of Berlin could blast us from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air we were beyond them; and before the other massed</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-cities over which we were rushing could receive</seg><seg type="columnLine">that alarm we had split the air westward above them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had rushed out from over the last of their titanic</seg><seg type="columnLine">floating masses and into the night!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're clear of the cities!" I yelled to Hilliard over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thunderous droning of our motors and the roar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">winds about us. "If we can shake off these pursuing</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruisers we'll win back across the Atlantic yet!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But their whole battle-fleet is rising now!" cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hilliard, gazing back. "And now all their air-cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">are beginning to move westward too--all their hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-cities are moving west to the attack!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Across the Atlantic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DESPITE the wild peril of our rushing ship, I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment all the blood congealing around my</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart as Hilliard yelled those words, and I looked back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward for one last glimpse. For there, behind us, behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hundred ships that were pursuing us, the whole two</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand cruisers of the European battle-fleet had risen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were coming westward also. They were not pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suing us so much as they were speeding westward ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cording to their plan, moving after as in a great cres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent formation! And, behind them, we could see now</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the hundred gigantic air-cities of the European Fed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">542	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eration, massed there in a colossal circular formation</seg><seg type="columnLine">about their central city of Berlin; moving westward</seg><seg type="columnLine">also behind the crescent of their fleet, they were flash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with terrible majesty through the air in their cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cular-massed formation; at a speed that mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly to two hundred miles an hour!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great attack had begun!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only a moment I gazed back upon that colossal spec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacle never seen by man before, and knew that in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, far on the world's other side, the hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">great air-cities of the Asiatic Federation would be rush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing eastward; the two great forces of hurtling air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities were converging upon the American Federation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, as we shot forward with our own greater and</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific speed, the vast massed cities and the fleet before</seg><seg type="columnLine">them had passed from sight behind us and only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred grim pursuing cruisers were visible in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night as we hurtled on!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On--on--and now I shouted to Hilliard to go be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath to the cruiser's motor room. He moved down</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward them while I gripped the wheel tightly, standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">there alone in the bridge-room of the long great cruiser</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had but Hilliard and I inside it. And, while we</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtled on at our maximum terrible speed, as the cruis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers behind drove steadily after us, we realized that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">and our pursuers were outracing the sun around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth 1 We saw by the growing light that we were high</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the sea instead of land. The sea tliat we saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">through breaks in the vapor-layer, gleamed to the west</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us with sunset lines. We were over the Atlantic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now, as hope of escape from our pursuers burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger within me. there came a sudden faltering in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steady drone of our great motors! I felt our</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruiser lose speed in that moment, knew that faltering</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be caused by the circuit-breakers tripping at the tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous power we were using. But then after an</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful moment of hesitation the motors were droning</seg><seg type="columnLine">as loudly as ever as Hilliard, beneath, had thrown back</seg><seg type="columnLine">the circuit-breakers in the connections that conveyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the static electricity from the atmospheric charge about</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to our transformers. Only a moment had we fal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered thus; but in that moment the hundred pursuers</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind had come swiftly closer!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Coward still, like some phantom, we rushed, minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">after minute of droning, racing flight, with the sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">set ahead flaming brilliant now, as we overtook it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Steadily, the long gleaming ships behind us were creep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing closer while the sun rose in the western sky.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though Hilliard was working like a madman in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor-room beneath, tending the motors as a mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiously watches her child, he was but one and could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not do the work of a dozen. And so, on after us, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came; drawing toward us so close that at last I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we could not win free of them in our frenzied</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight. For, although we had rushed on for a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">that seemed endless to us, and a few hundred miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained between us and the American coast, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaders were so near now that another minute, I knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would find them using their bow guns upon us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as the thought came to me, there was a thunder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing detonation behind us and then but a few feet to</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side, a shining heat-shell flashed past us. An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other detonation, and another followed, and I knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">not for long could we escape them thus; since with each</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment the shooting was becoming more accurate. So,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as a dozen of their bow guns thundered again, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly drove the cruiser downward in a flying head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">long plunge down through the vapor-layer beneath us;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, as the pursuing ships plunged straight down after</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, I sent our own cruiser instantly whirling upward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and through that layer once more!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was a maneuver that gained us a moment's advan-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tage; since when the pursuing ships drove up through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the vapor-masses again on my track, it took them an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">instant to locate and shape their course after me. In</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that instant we had moved a little from them; but now,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">remorselessly as ever, they came on after us, as pur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sued and pursuing ships drove like light toward the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flaming western sky. On and on, on until again they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were close behind, until again their guns were begin-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ning to thunder, and then I repeated my former ma-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">neuver, my last resort. I dived headlong downward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">again through the vapor-layer, and upward again, as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their ships drove after me. But, when I flashed up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">again through the vapor-masses this time, I suddenly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slowed my ship, slowed it and then held it motionless</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there in mid-air, with cold of icy fear tight around my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heart in that moment! For, this time, half of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hundred pursuing ships had not dived down after me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but had flashed on ahead as I drove down; and so,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">now, when I flashed up they hung before me, while the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">remainder drove still toward me from behind! I was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trapped at last between their masses of ships before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and behind me!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Slowing my cruiser, holding it motionless there with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mechanical fingers in that moment, I knew it to be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the end. Our last moment had come. The two masses</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of ships were moving toward me, from ahead and be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hind, were moving toward our cruiser. Our only escape</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cut off, no twists or turns now could save us; they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were converging upon us, were moving deliberately</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">toward us from either side. Another moment, I knew,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and hundreds of heat-guns would thunder from them,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of heat-shells would send our ship down-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ward in flaring, fusing destruction. Another moment--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A great cry sounded beside me, and I wheeled to find</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Hilliard pointing mutely upward toward a mass of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">long, gleaming shapes that were rushing headlong down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upon us from high above, that were diving headlong</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down upon the European cruisers to east and west of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">us, raining a hail of heat-shells upon them! "American</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ships!" My cry was echoing Hilliard's. Great gleam-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">• ing cruisers, outnuml&gt;ering the hundred east and west</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of us, were driving down upon those hundred with all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">, their heat-guns thundering! Then in the next moment,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">' while our own cruiser hung motionless, helpless there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in mid-air, American and European cruisers were whirl-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing in a mad, swift battle about us, ships striking and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">falling like lightning on all sides of us. And before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we could comprehend with our stunned minds what was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">taking place, the European cruisers had suddenly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dropped from that battle, had massed together and were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">splitting the air eastward, rushing back eastward and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">disappearing toward the mighty approaching armada</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of great air-cities and cruisers of which they were the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scouts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now from the mass of the American cruisers one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shot toward our own, level and hung beside our own</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ship, and as its door was flung open we opened the door</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of our own. I stared at a tall figure, not crediting my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Macklin!" I cried as I recognized him: "Macklin!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">You got clear, then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Brant--Hilliard--!" he was himself exclaiming:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"It is you two in that ship, then!

Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath us. the gray Atlantic showed here and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">through openings in the vapor-masses, and ahead the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun still hung in the western sky. And within a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes more, we saw that the vapor-layer beneath was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinning, and that now we were flashing not over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea but over land; over green hills and valleys that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could glimpse rushing past far beneath us. I gazed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">north and south in search of New York and the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">coastal air-cities that should have hung there, but noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was in sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All our American Federation air-cities," Macklin</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me: "are massed together, hanging south of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great Lakes.

God, what a battle it will be!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now Hilliard had broken into our conversation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pointing far ahead toward a tiark, flat mass that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood out against the brilliant western sky, and toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we were moving. The terrific speed at which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been racing on for hours was decreasing now. Far</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the land was still rolling back at great speed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">long green plains now; since already we had flashed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE AIR	543</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">west over the Alleghanies. Then, as the dark mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">westward grew steadily with our approach to it, other</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships were driving suddenly beside our own, watchful</seg><seg type="columnLine">patrols that drove down upon ojir hundred cruisers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly challenged them. Macklin answered those chal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenges by the distance-phone, but for the moment I paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">small attention to him, gazing forward with heart beat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing rapidly at the great mass that hung high in mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">air before us. For, as we drove closer toward that</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass, it was becoming visible to our eyes as our goal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hundred giant air-cities of the American Federation 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">The hundred mighty American Federation air-cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">were clustered there miles above the green plains, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great circular mass, with New York, most colossal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of them, at the center! Cities that had long hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">over North and South America from sea to sea, air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities whose names were those of the long-vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities of the land, that once had dotted the surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those continents. Boston and Los Angeles, Rio de</seg><seg type="columnLine">Janeiro and Chicago, Mexico City and Quebec, Val-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paraiso and Miami--these and scores of others hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in that great cluster. All the air-cities of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American Federation were gathered here about their</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-capital of New York to withstand the tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacks now closing in from east and west I</seg><seg type="columnLine">Massed there as they were, the hundred mighty air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities seemed, even as the European ones had seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me, but one vast plain of metal towers and streets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As far as the eye could reach, there stretched away</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tremendous forest of those soaring towers, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there rising from them the taller spires of</seg><seg type="columnLine">each city's great electrostatic tower. And, everywhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">among those towers, everywhere around the rim of</seg><seg type="columnLine">each great circular air-city and at its center there loomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">great batteries of giant heat-guns; while here and there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the plazas of the cities rested the turret-like cubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the recalled great air-forts, their own grim heat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns protruding expectantly. And through streets and</seg><seg type="columnLine">towers, between the batteries and around the air-forts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and across the plazas of the assembled cities, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarmed the millions of their peoples, wild with excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment now as the last dread hour approached. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">massed there above all the great floating cities, hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim and motionless the two thousand or more cruisers</seg><seg type="columnLine">that still remained of the American Federation's eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">and western fleets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was toward these massed battle-cruisers, at a level</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat higher than that of the air-cities, that our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own hundred cruisers were rushing. Over those assem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled giant cities we raced, the great mass of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">below us almost hiding the ground beneath. As we</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot above them, I saw now that they had been ranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a tremendous circle, the great capital of New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging in the center. Across the great ring of the air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities we rushed; were racing at last above New York,</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward its own giant power-tower. Then we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached it, and were sinking vertically downward, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">our hundred cruisers came to rest upon the central</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaza. Here, even as in Berlin, the central plaza was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reserved always for the ships of the First Air Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his followers; so that, although immense crowds</seg><seg type="columnLine">now beat through all the streets and plazas about it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were none around our hundred ships. And in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant Macklin and Hilliard and I were out of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had brought us and hastening across the clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">space toward the static-tower's base.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Preparations</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON past its guards and through the ante-rooms we</seg><seg type="columnLine">strode, and in another moment were in the office</seg><seg type="columnLine">544	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the First Air Chief. There was unfamiliar appa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ratus among the great switchboards of its walls, I noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we entered. The First Air Chief himself had risen</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his great table-map as we entered and was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing toward us; beside him, another figure, whom I</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized instantly as Connell. Then both of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">were grasping the hands of Hilliard and of myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Brant!" Yarnall was exclaiming: "I got Macklin's</seg><seg type="columnLine">report of your escape and his rescue of you--man, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm glad that you got free! And it was what you did</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in Berlin, what you did to help Connell and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Macklin escape, that has enabled us to use Connell's</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge and fit our air-cities for the coming battle!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I did no more than the others," I told him: "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know of the enemy's coming then? You know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that already the European Federation cities are on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">way ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded. "They and the Asiatic Federation's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities from the westward, Brant," he said: "And we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are awaiting them here--awaiting them with a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least, thanks to you four--to strike back at them</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they come. And already they are near--by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">map here you can see--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he turned toward the great table-map upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was depicted the whole of the earth's surface, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red circles upon it tlenoting as before the position of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air-cities that hung above it. Now, however, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the circles of the American Federation cities were</seg><seg type="columnLine">massed together south of the white outline of the Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lakes, hanging motionless as the cities around us were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging motionless. Away to the east on the map,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, just moving in from the Atlantic over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastern coast, there was creeping across the map an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other mass of red circles, moving slowly toward our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own, that represented the great gathered cities of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">European Federation that were rushing westward</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward us. And in from the Pacific was creeping a</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar mass of a hundred little red circles that were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew, the Asiatic Federation's cities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From east and west they were moving, there on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the map, moving even as the cities they represented</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved through the air, automatically showing their</seg><seg type="columnLine">positions and progress. This was accomplished, I knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by means of special batteries of cruiser-finders, tuned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and trained to detect the great electro-static motors of</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-cities, and recording instantly thus whenever those</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities moved with their great electric fields. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">records were carried through complicated mechanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculators which plotted the exact positions and move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of the cities; and these calculators, in turn, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">connected to small special projectors set beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great ground-glass table-map, casting upward upon it</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red circles of the air-cities. Thus those red circles</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved upon the map, even as the great air-cities moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This arrangement, indeed, was of no late date, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was used by both European and Asiatic Federations</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as by ourselves; but as I gazed now about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great circular room I saw that within it were some</seg><seg type="columnLine">new arrangements also. These consisted of a series</seg><seg type="columnLine">of six great glass screens which were arranged in box-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like form about the great air-city's controls at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room's center. And, while the First Air Chief swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained to us their purpose and design, I saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">one sitting inside their box-fonn. with four on four</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides, and one above and one below, could see in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all those directions as though from the very top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great power-tower. For they were in effect great</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrical periscopes: four great similar screens had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been set on four sides of the electro-static tower's high</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tip, and another one above that tip, while the sixth had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been set in the under-side of the great city's base. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">views possible to those six screens were then trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferred down to the six there about us; the light-vibra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions that struck the screens above and beneath being</seg><seg type="columnLine">transformed by television receivers into electrical vibra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions and brought down to television reproducers behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own six screens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Sitting there at the city's controls, amid those six</seg><seg type="columnLine">screens and looking into them, one could see as clearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though from the power-tower's tip in all directions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was quite necessary, too, that this should be the case;</seg><seg type="columnLine">since the man who operated the great air-city, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">its six direction-controls and its single speed control</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, must see clearly in all directions, now that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great air-cities could rush at such tremendous speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the air. When I said as much to the First</seg><seg type="columnLine">Air Chief, who had turned now and was gazing intently</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the great table-map upon which the eastern and</seg><seg type="columnLine">western masses of circles were slowly creeping toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own, he nodded, and contemplated me for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment with a curious expression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The man," he said finally, "who is to hold the</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls of New York in the battle tomorrow, will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Brant!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The honor is great," I said: "I've operated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city's controls, though never did I expect to take it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle. But Macklin and Hilliard here--I want them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stay here for the time being--I want the hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruisers on the plaza outside to stay there during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have a plan?" the First Air Chief asked, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shook my head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No more than an idea," I said: "An idea that may</seg><seg type="columnLine">help us if the battle goes against us, if their attack is</seg><seg type="columnLine">too strong for us. Even then it is too insane, perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be of any use, but it might help us--''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Yarnall nodded assent, and then Macklin and Hilliard</seg><seg type="columnLine">had joined the two dozen or more of black-garbed at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendants and engineers who were busy at the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">switchboards that lined the circular room's walls. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrutinized its dials to determine the rate of the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">currents rushing down from the power-tower's tip far</seg><seg type="columnLine">above to the motors in the city's great base; added a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh battery of transformers or threw in resistances</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold that curtent steady; and moved ceaselessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the walls in their anxious watch. Now, Yarnall</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Connell and I were marking our own places, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three metal seats there behind the big table-map, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great screens of the electrical periscopes all about</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. Yarnall would sit in the center, with eyes upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red circles on the great map, tensely watching their</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress, as admiral of our mighty fleet of colossal</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities, ready to direct it and our cruisers to the battle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Connell would be at his right, before him the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouthpiece and speaker of a single distance-phone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Behind that were the scores of switches and intricate</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls, which connected that distance-phone to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operators of all our hundred air-cities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Battle Nears</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS the third of the trio, I would sit at Yamall's</seg><seg type="columnLine">left, before me the six switch-levers which sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the colossal city of New York whirling through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air in any direction; while beside them was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming knob which regulated the city's speed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">great batteries of New York were at my command also;</seg><seg type="columnLine">all their mighty heat-guns around the city's edge and</seg><seg type="columnLine">around our electro-static tower and elsewhere were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trolled by the distance-phone whose mouthpiece rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">CITIES IN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">before me. The great batteries of all our other cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">were controlled in the same way by their own oper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ators, and were subject like New York to the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mands of the First Air Chiaf beside me, who could</seg><seg type="columnLine">maneuver our whole great armada of tremendous cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">at will through the air. In the city of San Francisco,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, we knew, was the Second Air Chief, placed there</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take command in case New York were destroyed or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the First Air Chief disabled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus, on the morrow were grouped we three, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to sway such colossal forces in a battle as no men</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen before. Now, Yarnall was pointing to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table-map's surface, where the red massed circles of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">European and Asiatic Federation armadas were in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicated but a few hundred miles on either side of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own great mass of cities. Watching them there, we sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">in silence, save for the clicking of occasional switches</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the engineers about us. From far away, far across</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York and all the other air-cities gathered around</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, there was coming the dull, dim throbbing of the life</seg><seg type="columnLine">of millions that swarmed through those cities. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">now Yarnall reached forward and touched the control</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great electrical periscopes whose screens boxed</seg><seg type="columnLine">us in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly those dull glass screens were alive with</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, and it was as though we were gazing forth from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very tip of the power-tower out over our gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of cities. North and east and south and west,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from all the screens about us the views were alike, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tremendous mass of clustered metal towers that en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circled New York. Below us was the screen, above</seg><seg type="columnLine">which our metal seats were suspended on supports. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed a trap-door through which we were gazing down</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the green plains far beneath; though in reality</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the city's massive base lay between us and that view.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So intensely realistic was the scene that lay about us</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we all but forgot the great circular room in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we really were, and seemed suspended high in air above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great mass of our gathered air-cities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The enemy armadas," said Yarnall, his voice low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"will be in sight within fifteen minutes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For upon the map the two masses of red circles were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing on from east and west, and seemed now almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the mass of circles that was our own great fleet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cities. Looking out over those cities, through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">periscopic screens about us, we could see the forts</seg><seg type="columnLine">raising their great guns to firing range. I realized, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw it, that the battle now ready to start would mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">annihilation to half the world. This was indeed Arma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geddon, when on earth itself was left no human being</seg><seg type="columnLine">at peace; when every nation was rushing through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air toward this last conflict 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, however, Yarnall touched another control, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the electro-static tower's tip, high above us flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">great signals of brilliant lights that were taken up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeated from all the power-towers of all the hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities that ringed us round. And, as those signals</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed, the great crowds that filled the streets of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-cities were suddenly flowing out of those streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the cities' towers; until within a few moments none</seg><seg type="columnLine">were visible in all the streets and plazas, save those</seg><seg type="columnLine">black-uniformed men who stood ready at the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat-gyns of our batteries. And those crowds went</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly, despite their tense excitement, because they</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that they were being ordered inside for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater protection. There was no refuge upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's surface far beneath, for them; when the destruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive powers of all the world were battling above it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE AIR	545</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the First Air Chief spoke a brief order and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Connell beside him repeated it swiftly into the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance-phone (as he did with Yarnall's orders in all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">combat that followed) the great fleet of cruisers hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing above us and visible in our top screen divided into</seg><seg type="columnLine">two masses, of a thousand or more ships each, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept swiftly to east and west. Beyond the great ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">of air-cities they leaped, until they were far out; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">each division then formed into a great curving line</seg><seg type="columnLine">screening our ring of cities to east and west, facing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleets rushing toward them from those directions. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were gazing again at the table-map before us, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deathly silence seeming to grip all the world. Upon that</seg><seg type="columnLine">map we could see the European and Asiatic armadas</seg><seg type="columnLine">were now within hardly more than a hundred miles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own; and tensely we watched the east and western</seg><seg type="columnLine">screens now, gazing out beyond our cities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They'll use their cruiser-fleets for their first attack,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yarnall was saying as we gazed tensely forth. "They'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to wipe out ou^ cruisers before they bring their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities on to attack ours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded. "It would give them a big advantage</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the cities come to blows. But our cruisers beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">them back once with the odds two to one, and now--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I broke off sharply, and at the same moment heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">a low breath from Yarnall and Connell simultaneously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt seemingly a low tremor that seemed to run in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantaneously across all our massed air-cities. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, far to the westward, black against the sky, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had appeared a line of far-flung black dots that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing very quickly in size, and that were massed to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether in a crescent formation whose horns were toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. It was the advancing cruiser-fleet of the Asiatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Federation forces. Tensely we watched it as it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">on; then we looked to the east to see a similar crescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of advancing dots, the European cruiser fleet. On they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, smoothly rushing toward our own lines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruisers, hanging to the east and west of our cities; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then for the moment we forgot them as we made out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to east and west, behind them, advancing toward us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">great black masses that even at that distance seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fill the air. They were the two massed mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">armadas of the European and Asiatic Federation's air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities, rushing to battle with our own!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          CHAPTER X</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          The First Clash</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR one moment we gazed toward them and toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the advancing cruisers that rushed before them, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though held by the grandeur of the spectacle. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous mass of our air-cities hanging there, high</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the earth the gleaming ranks of our own two</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand cruisers that poised to east and west, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advancing cruiser-fleets of twice their strength behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">which there rushed gigantically on the great massed</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-cities of our enemies--it was a spectacle breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking enough! But, then, the two enemy cruiser fleets</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come within a short distance of our own waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruisers; and, as they did so, both their fleets shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly upward, as though in answer to a common</seg><seg type="columnLine">order, to drive above our own cruisers and our air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly Yarnall had uttered a swift order; and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Connell's quick voice sent that order flying out to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruiser-masses, they too whirled upward and forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">to meet the onrushing enemy fleets. Then, far out in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mid-air to east and west of us the great cruiser fleets</seg><seg type="columnLine">had met, had smashed into each other with blind fury.</seg><seg type="columnLine">546</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Through our screens we saw cruisers enveloped by</seg><seg type="columnLine">scores in blinding flares, in that first moment of combat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they raged in two separate mighty battles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, east and west, our own cruisers were outnum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered two to one and, despite their fierce resistance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were being pressed steadily back toward our gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities.

Yamall sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">another order flying out, and the next moment a mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cruisers that had remained at the edges of our gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered cities, on either side, and had not been in the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle, were leaping forward now, like suddenly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leased hounds after prey. A score of them to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastern combat and a score to the western one they</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed; and each, as it reached the lines of struggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships, shot up over them and then flashed along their</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines above them. And as they did, there shot down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward from them over the battling cruisers intense jets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of concentrated water vapor, which puffed out instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into great white cloud masses that enveloped all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grappling thousands of ships!	,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yamall had brought into the battle, I saw, those</seg><seg type="columnLine">great artificial cloud projectors that had saved us in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our first great battle over the Atlantic! And, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">as their white masses enveloped the struggling ships,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sent forth another order; and our own cruisers shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward and downward out of those cloud-masses, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very instant that they had been formed. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all our own cruisers clear of the cloud-masses to</seg><seg type="columnLine">east and west, and the European and Asiatic ships in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side them driving for the moment in blind confusion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our cruisers poured a deadly hail of heat-shells down</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the cloud-masses and the thousands of ships that</seg><seg type="columnLine">swirled inside them! Only for a moment was it that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they remained within the cloud-masses before fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">their way free; but in that moment they had been un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to fire a single effective shell at our own ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside, and we had poured a veritable storm of deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">shells into the cloudy masses. So when, a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, the European and Asiatic ships broke from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vapor-clouds east and westward, our broadsides had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken toll of hundreds of their blinded ships, and hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than our own forces did they number now!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, when they broke free from the cloud-masses</seg><seg type="columnLine">and into open air again, they did not advance toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">our awaiting ships; instead they shot back from either</seg><seg type="columnLine">front toward their cities, in answer to some mysteriflus</seg><seg type="columnLine">order. At once a similar order from Yamall brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashing back, to form again above our own cities, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own ships--still nearly two thousand strong and almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">as many i'n number as the combined cruisers of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies. I heard dimly the great cheers that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling across all our cities, for this mighty blow which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had beaten back our enemies' cruiser-fleets once more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then those cheers died swiftly away; for, far away to</seg><seg type="columnLine">east and west, the gigantic masses of the approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-cities loomed larger and larger, rushing through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air toward us!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eastward the European Federation was approaching,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a gigantic circle that seemed to fill the whole eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. To us three sitting there amid our periscopic</seg><seg type="columnLine">screens, it was as though all the eastern screen was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with that great oncoming mass of cities; Paris,</seg><seg type="columnLine">London, Moscow, Cairo, Rome--all the tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-cities of the great European Federation--and their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">capital of Berlin still at the center.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And westward, upon our western screen, loomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally gigantic the similar circle of air-cities of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Asiatic Federation. Peking, the third in size of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world's air-capitals, at the center of its cluster of cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed at the same smooth speed toward us, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shanghai and Tokio and Bombay and Rangoon fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most in its circle. From east and west thus the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupendous circles of cities rushed toward our own,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly waiting; and, as we watched them, there flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over me in that tense moment a strange wonder as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the feelings with which one of a hundred years</seg><seg type="columnLine">before would have watched this battle. Then I laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside that passing wonder as the two great circles drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer to the range of our great heat-gun batteries.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And this, surely, was a spectacle that none had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen or dreamed before--this spectacle of the world's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty cities converging swiftly upon each other in</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle to the death!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as strange, too, must have been the sight of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">three, sitting there amid our box-like periscopic screens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heart of the mighty tower's base; yet seeing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">directing from there all the great mass of the hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty cities around us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're not going to join forces!" I exclaimed:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They're going to strike us at the same moment from</seg><seg type="columnLine">east and west!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yamall nodded, his eyes intent upon the screens:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Either that," he said, "or--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE broke off suddenly; for at that moment there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to us a giant salvo of thunder from both</seg><seg type="columnLine">east and west, a terrific shock of sound that rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeply through the air toward us from the two distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">armadas advancing! An instant later there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistling sound over our own cities, and we knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great storm of heat-shells was plunging toward them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A few struck with wild bursting flares across our</seg><seg type="columnLine">massed cities, and with their suddenly-released gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat there appeared great craters of fusing, melting</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal. The greater part of the shells, though, fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">short, whirled down to earth to flash on the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">far below. The range was not yet closed, I knew; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far our own great cities remained silent as death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yamall was watching now with hands clenched tightly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the two circles from east and west came on. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment later there rolled from them another great</seg><seg type="columnLine">salvo, and another mass of shells rushed toward us;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but, though most of these also fell short, a greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">number than before flared and fused in melting, sear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing death upon our own massed cities!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gazed anxiously at Yamall, a strange dread taking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">possession of me for an instant as the tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">armadas came on. Would he never give the order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire? He was sitting still as a carved statue, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the screens and his lips compressed; and in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment there came to me a dim sense of all the ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rific responsibility that weighed upon him, the leader</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a third of earth's cities and peoples battling against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the remainder of mankind. Silent he sat and still, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great approaching armadas rushed nearer, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities coming more and more distinctly into view in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our far-seeing screens. In another moment, I knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">another thunderous broadside would be belching toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. But, just as I looked for it to come, Yamall spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">a single word and, as Connell's swift voice sent that</seg><seg type="columnLine">word flying out to all our cities, as my own flashed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to all the batteries of our centermost city of New York,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a hush of a split-second. And then, out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Armageddon!</seg><seg type="columnLine">CITIES IN THE AIR	547</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from all our own hundred giant cities, there broke such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a titanic thundering detonation as seemed to shake</seg><seg type="columnLine">violently all the air about us! And, an instant later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we saw the heat-shells from our batteries falling in</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands upon the two advancing armadas, upon their</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing gigantic cities, and flaring into white-hot craters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fusing roetal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before that terrific blow the two advancing masses</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to stagger a little in mid-air, to hesitate for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant; but then they advanced steadily onward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their own great batteries thundered an answer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our salvo. Then, as the two giant circles drew nearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our own on either side, the whole world seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">swallowed again in one ceaseless thundering of sound.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The giant batteries of all our great air-cities burst forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, to send a storm of heat-shells rushing east and</seg><seg type="columnLine">west upon our enemies! The air between us and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">armadas nearing on either side must have been filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with shells in that moment; for we saw tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">flares there in mid-air as shells of ours met some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">theirs and burst. But few of them did that, most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them whirling through the air to burst and flare in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">their awful destroying heat and brilliance upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-cities!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In that instant, as the batteries of all three gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">armadas thundered^ it seemed that numberless foun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains of brilliant light and terrific heat were springing</seg><seg type="columnLine">into being amid the metal towers of all the three masses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of great air-cities! Great fountains of heat unthink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, beneath which all the metal about them fused and</seg><seg type="columnLine">melted instantly, and about which all life was scorched</seg><seg type="columnLine">into annihilation! Yet this had taken but the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment of the battle to accomplish; and now, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two great circles of the European and Asiatic Federa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions swept nearer, I saw that two of the foremost of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great European cities, Paris and Lisbon, were stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gering and reeling as they rushed forward with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest! They had met an awful storm of striking heat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shells from our own cities; and though their great</seg><seg type="columnLine">motors were deep in their mighty bases, though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alloy of their electrostatic towers could not be affected</seg><seg type="columnLine">by heat-shells, yet the deadly hail of shells that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen upon them had penetrated apparently almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to their great motors beneath!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I whirled to Yarnall. "Paris and Lisbon!" I cried:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They're falling behind the rest a little--they're hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded, eyes burning now: "All east batteries</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentrate on Paris and Lisbon!" he ordered; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Connell's voice sent the order flying out to our eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">massed cities, their batteries were thundering with even</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater fury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now all their shells were aimed toward the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">crippled cities of Paris and Lisbon, and a hell of burst-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing shells were flaring across those two ill-fated giants</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the air. It was as though a living wave, of bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liant heat and light from the bursting shells, were dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cing like lightning across the two cities; and in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant it must have burned from them all the life in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their towers, even as they were striving to do with</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own. The towers of each city became in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment almost a single great surface of fusing, white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot metal; its awfulness added to by the exploding of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stores of heat-shells and magazines l&gt;eneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific flares. Out beyond them and around them</seg><seg type="columnLine">there swept other cities of the European armada to</seg><seg type="columnLine">protect them. There came Madrid and London and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moscow, all their guns thundering answer; but now</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own gunners were not to be denied of their prey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As our batteries sent repeated storms of shells upon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the two doomed cities we saw Paris staggering, slip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping to a lower level, hanging a moment there, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then whirling sidewise downward, down to the green</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth far below! In a moment it had crashed, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific rending and cracking of metal!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I heard a dull roar of cheers rolling across our city</seg><seg type="columnLine">above and between the thunder of the guns, cheers that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were redoubled a moment later as Lisbon too whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward to annihilation, a mere mass of fusing metal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, even as the cheers sounded they were stilled, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yarnall was uttering further orders to our batteries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the Asiatic Federation's circle, a great smoth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering fire of shells had been falling in those moments</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the westernmost of our own cities, upon Omaha.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Its guns were still thundering in savage answer; but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">battery by battery, they were going silent as there fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them the concentrated fire of the whole advancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Asiatic Federation cities, the great guns of Peking</seg><seg type="columnLine">thundering at the center of the rest. Then Omaha,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, had slipped and staggered and was whirling down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to earth in fusing destruction, its motors reached by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bursting shells at last!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Avoiding the Ambush</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOW it seemed as though in all the world was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing but thundering guns and bursting shells;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for now as they came nearer toward each other the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">great circles of cities were exchanging a veritable tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pest of heat-shells upon each other. Watching that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hell of battle through our screens, we three sat tensely</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. Yamall's eyes were intent upon the advancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">armadas; Connell, gripping his distance-phone, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">barking orders to the great cities that were thundering</seg><seg type="columnLine">about us. The two giant circles of the enemies' cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">were very near our own now, rushing toward us at</seg><seg type="columnLine">their tremendous speed; and, as they thus neared us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed that nothing could surpass the tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring broadsides that were hurled from city to city.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw Amsterdam and Madrid staggering a little behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fellows, reeling beneath our awful fire, saw Hong-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kong in the Asiatic forces, its great towers all but</seg><seg type="columnLine">evelled by the flaring heat-shells, plunge suddenly down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward as more of those shells reached its motors! But</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our own mass now New Orleans was plunging like-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise beneath the fire of the advancing fleets; and St.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louis was swaying as though badly hit!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But at that moment there came an abrupt exclama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion from Yamall; and then we saw that the two ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vancing circles of the enemy cities, rushing toward our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own, were changing their form, were changing swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into two great crescents of which the horns of each</seg><seg type="columnLine">were toward us. Those two giant crescents were mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to join each other, to form one great circle; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they did so, our own mass of cities would be com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely surrounded by the overwhelming numbers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our enemies, the easy target for all their mighty bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teries. We would inevitably be annihilated by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosing circle of the enemy. But, even before I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood that maneuver, Yamall's swift order was</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashing out to all our gathered cities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "North at full speed for all cities! Unchanged for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mation !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next instant our whole great mass of cities was</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving, was moving with swiftly mounting speed north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward! For, as his order sounded I had jerked open</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speed-control before me, had flung back one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction-levers. And, as I did so, there had come a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great droning of motors from beneath, resounding even</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the madly-thundering guns, flinging all the mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">city of New York northward. Also there came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">548	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">great hissing of the numberless new tube-propellers</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were jerking it swiftly forward! And, as New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York leaped northward at my touch, all its great bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teries still detonating, so were all the great air-cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ringed us leaping northward, and all their guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">were still thundering toward the advancing armadas!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now the enemy had seen our swift leap north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, and, as their commanders guessed our purpose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they sent their own two crescents whirling toward us</seg><seg type="columnLine">with even greater speed to enclose us before we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape! For the next moment it was a race between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three great city-masses, a race in which our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought to evade the two that closed upon it from either</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. And, as our cities and theirs raced through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air at tremendous speed, ev«7 gun still firing, it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we must lose! For, just north of us, the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">northward horns of the closing crescents had almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">met, were almost joined before us! That northward</seg><seg type="columnLine">horn of the Asiatic crescent held Shanghai and Colombo</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Singapore and others; while the horn that pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected from the European mass had foremost in it Mos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cow and Brussels and Algiers. And as we shot north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward in that wild moment, to escape before those two</seg><seg type="columnLine">horns could join, Yamall sent flying forth a swift order</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all batteries in all our cities to concentrate their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire now upon the foremost cities in the two closing</seg><seg type="columnLine">horns to the north!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At once our own guns were thundering with re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubled fury; for, unless we could destroy in the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes the foremost of those cities north of us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would have closed upon us and brought our irre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trievable doom. So, disregarding for the time all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other air-cities of the two closing crescents about us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all fire was concentrated upon the foremost cities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two horns closing northward. A storm of heat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shells rushed thick through the air toward them; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same time the masses of European and Asiatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities east and west of us were pouring down upon us</seg><seg type="columnLine">the broadsides of their own giant batteries! And be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath that terrific fire, cities among our mass were</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling swift in fusing destruction. St. Louis and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miami and Seattle were whirling to death as we raced</seg><seg type="columnLine">onward; all the people in them who had been left</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive by the shells were meeting annihilation in the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash far below!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, though we were being decimated by the fire of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the closing crescents on either side, our own terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentrated fire was having effect upon the closing</seg><seg type="columnLine">horns of cities north of us, and in the moments while</seg><seg type="columnLine">we rushed toward them, Singapore, Colombo and Brus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sels had been sent down in white-hot destruction by</seg><seg type="columnLine">our awful fire. The remaining cities in those two pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jecting horns were still rushing toward each other with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their utmost speed to close the gap between them before</seg><seg type="columnLine">our great circle could speed through it. With Moscow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Shanghai at their eastern and western tips, the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">homs swiftly closed toward each other; while as swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with every motor droning its loudest, with every</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat-gun thundering northward, we shot onward. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment the whole great race was in doubt; for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment it seemed to us that our great mass of cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">co'ild flash through that gap before it closed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as we watched in tense, terrible hope, even as</seg><seg type="columnLine">our mighty cities raced northward, the cities of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">closing homs seemed to make a last supreme effort,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a last great burst of speed. They shot forward, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaders Shanghai and Moscow almost racing into each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other; and then, with all their tube-propellers reversed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were suddenly halting a barrier of mighty air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities all around us! But nothing now could halt our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous mass, so awful was our speed and so close</seg><seg type="columnLine">were we to the enemy's line. I saw those cities loom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing suddenly gigantic before our own mass as we raced</seg><seg type="columnLine">on; heard hoarse exclamations from Yarnall and Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nell beside me; and then with a terrific shock, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed the shock of meeting worlds, our vast north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward-flying mass of air-cities had crashed headlong</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the great line of cities before us!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          CHAPTER XI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          City Against City</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN the moment that followed, after our flashing circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cities had thundered headlong into the line before</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, all other sounds, all the thunder of countless</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns and the drone of motors and the hiss of tube-</seg><seg type="columnLine">propellers and cries of voices, were drowned in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous splintering crash of metal upon metal. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant mass of cities about us seemed to reel drunkenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in mid-air in that moment. New York at their center</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered from the awful shock transmitted to it. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the screen north of me, I saw titanic metal masses</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had been cities falling downward. Moscow with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sydney and Algiers, and Boston with Detroit, these</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled downward in that moment--no longer recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nizable as air-cities and seeming to the eye but great</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted bulks of rended metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But not even that giant collision had been able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">halt the tremendous momentum of our northward-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thundering mass of cities; for as those cities before</seg><seg type="columnLine">us crashed downward, the whole great circle of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass, New York still at its center, was thundering on</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the gap that that crash had made in the line</seg><seg type="columnLine">before us! We were sweeping northward and out</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond that line that our great crash had shattered. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had won free only by means of that awful crash. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly, Yarnall had cried another order, and our great</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of air-cities was swiftly shifting its formation</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a long line; and at its head rushed our own city</seg><seg type="columnLine">of New York. And then, while the great circle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy's combined armada remained there for the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment still behind us, as though stunned by our colossal</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash and escape through it, the First Air Chief sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">another order flashing forth. At once our line turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a wheeling snake, high in the air, and was rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">back upon the circle of our enemies! We were rush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing back and along the line of European Federation</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities that made up that circle's eastern half for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. And, as our long line of mighty cities whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">past them, all our batteries were thundering upon them</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The advantage now was all with us; since in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">great circular formation more than half their great</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of cities could not reach us with their guns. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so during that moment, the odds were more than even</seg><seg type="columnLine">as our long line swept on, with all our batteries pour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their broadsides forth! Steady at the controls, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">held New York at that colossal line's head, holding it</seg><seg type="columnLine">at an even distance from the great circle of the enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities. I saw now that our terrific fire, as we rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">past those cities, was swiftly in that moment taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect upon them. Even as I gazed, Amsterdam,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vienna, Cairo and Madrid were falling beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful concentrated fire of our rushing cities; and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own line Buenos Aires staggered, swayed and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the enemy barked savagely back toward us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On!" Yamall was crying beside me: "It's our</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to strike hard at them--before they can bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of their cities into action!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But they're doing it now!" I shouted back to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">CITIES IN THE AIR	549</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">above the thunder of guns, the drone of motors and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hissing tube-propellers. "They're stringing their circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into a line also!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For it was plainly visible, upon the great screen be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side me, that the commanders of the enemy were striv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to form their great circle into a line that could meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own more effectively in mid-air. We saw their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities rushing inward and changing formation there</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside us; but we knew that our change had come and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so hung upon the flank of the great mass of cities, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">line rushing along it with all our guns turned toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. And now, though Quebec was falling in our line,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our guns had sent down Copenhagen, Yokohama and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Calcutta in the mass beside us; since by now we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">raced past the mass of the European air-cities and our</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns were thundering against the Asiatic cities. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns roared sullenly in answer to us as we flashed past</seg><seg type="columnLine">them; but, for the moment, in their disorganization,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their attempts to reform swiftly from their circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a line like our own, their fire was seriously ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered by their own movements. In that moment we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were pouring a smothering hail of shells upon them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and city upon city was whirling downward in wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then suddenly, with a supremely swift effort, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle had lengthened, straightened, their confusion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment had vanished; and their cities had formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost instantly into a long line, like our own, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer than our own. We found ourselves in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment with our own line parallel in mid-air to theirs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mixture of European and Asiatic cities directly oppo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">site us; and then, as we raced on, they were racing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">with us, their own batteries thundering with newly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">released fury, as they sought to blast us from the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside them i I heard the sharp order of the First Air</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief beside me, and held New York steady at the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our line. The two great city-fleets were racing</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the air in a great running fight, with every</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun thundering!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Directly opposite New York there raced, at the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their line, the mighty air-city of Peking, third of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three great air-capitals. The two giants were evenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">matched; and now at the head of our respective lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">we engaged in a tremendous duel in mid-air, a duel</seg><seg type="columnLine">so intense that, almost, I forgot the fate of the rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">armadas behind us. In all New York about us mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">fountains of brilliant light and awful heat, were flar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with each salvo of heat-shells from the Asiatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">capital. But, at the same time, our own gunners were</seg><seg type="columnLine">working their .batteries like madmen; and we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see similar giant craters of fusing metal springing into</seg><seg type="columnLine">being over all the vast mass of clustered towers that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Peking. Far behind in the enemy's line raced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third great air-capital of Berlin; and we guessed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was now from B'erlin that the movements of all our</seg><seg type="columnLine">foes were being directed. But so awful was the battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we were undergoing with the Asiatic capital oppo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">site us that for the moment we forgot almost all else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind us, I was dimly aware of all our great line</seg><seg type="columnLine">of air-cities grappling with, the line rushing opposite;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicago, a little farther back in our line from ourselves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was carrying on as terrific a duel with London. Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantinople in the enemy's line was whirling downward</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the batteries of Denver and Valparaiso. Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treal, in our own, was falling in fusing death as it be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the target for all the giant batteries of the colossal</seg><seg type="columnLine">city of Berlin. City after city in the two racing, strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling lines was falling to annihilation as the awful battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">raged on. High above the colossal lines of racing cities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own great fleet of cruisers and the enemy's were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling in a wild fury, insane as our own giant battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cities. Surely Armageddon had come upon the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Although the European and Asiatic cities still out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbered us, we had cut down their great margin</seg><seg type="columnLine">of superiority in that attack which our line had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon their confused circle. Now, with equal fury, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were striking from line to line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Straight ahead of our two racing lines, there loomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">now a great bank of drifting vapors, great cloud-masses</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifting south from the lakes to the north. Neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our two battling lines desired to enter those vapor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses, and so as one, when we neared them, both</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines shot downward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Surrounded Again</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DOWN--down--with our batteries thundering still</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the gulf toward Peking, whose own guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered with as great a fury, though in their city</seg><seg type="columnLine">as in ours, battery after battery was being silenced!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Down--down--until the green earth beneath, lit by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">descending afternoon sun, seemed just beneath us, rush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up toward us with awful speed as we shot down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it! Yet in that dread moment neither line of strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling cities straightened upward, each fearful of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other's gaining an advantage. In an instant more, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed, New York must crash together headlong into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Downward we shot, and I saw the green plain loom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing awful beneath us. At the last moment I jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">back another of the direction-levers before me; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as, in answer to the controls, New York tipped sharply</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward once more. I saw Peking opposite rushing up</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same instant, saving itself as we had done. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind us the cities that directly followed in our two lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">were curving up as swiftly, all their guns thundering</seg><seg type="columnLine">still as furiously. But, farther back in the two lines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were cities that had swooped too low to recover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had dipped lower and in the next moment had crashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and been annihilated upon the green earth, as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">collided with it at their terrific speed!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But while our two lines were whirling upward at</seg><seg type="columnLine">as steep a slant as they had descended, the battle seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to deepen in furious intensity. New York and Peking</seg><seg type="columnLine">were stabbing still at each other with all their forces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each colossal city seeming too mighty to be struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, though each was flaming under a terrible fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shells. Behind us, after a running duel that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">achieved almost the magnitude and fully the intensity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our own, Chicago had given London the finishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroke; and that great city was wavering, staggering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then slipping and falling in white-hot annihilation</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the earth! And, as all along both lines, other</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities staggered and fell, I saw that above us the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling cruiser-fleets had almost entirely vanished.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had almost entirely annihilated each other by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">insane fury of their attacks!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I felt my brain spinning, felt all things about me re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solving into a wild whirl of thunderous sound and flar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing light. I heard, as though from a great distance the</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders of Yarnall beside me, and the frenzied voice of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Connell sending those orders flashing out from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance-phone; heard the thunder of guns and sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of motors and propellers and wild noises that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming from all the city about us. Then, before our</seg><seg type="columnLine">two onrushing lines, there loomed another great mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of drifting vapors; and again our two lines dipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward to avoid those masses. But, as we shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward, the line opposite us with Peking at its head</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot as quickly upward again, in answer to some com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">550	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mand; it raced on through the vapor-masses instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath them!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the next moment we had shot our own line upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">again to race side by side with them still; but we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">too late, for that moment had given them, at their tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous speed, the advantage for which they sought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For in that moment, rushing on through the vapor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses instead of beneath them, they had gained a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little; so that when we shot upward again to their level</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were ahead of us as well as beside us! And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">their line ahead of us was swiftly curving back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">around our other side! As we slowed instantly, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoid a collision that would annihilate us and all our</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass, they swept the end of their longer line around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear of our own, and thus in the next instant were</seg><seg type="columnLine">forming a complete circle around our cities. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last accomplished their great object, had managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to surround our mass of mighty cities, outnumbering</seg><seg type="columnLine">us still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As their circle closed lightning-like about us, we three</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat in that moment as though stunned; and then, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the air-cities that encircled us, a terrific thunderous</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire was pouring upon us! Encircled, we were a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect target now for all the European and Asiatic gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ners around us, pouring all their mighty broadsides</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon us. And now Yarnall had leaped to his feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tense agony in his eyes reflected in those of Connell</seg><seg type="columnLine">and myself in that terrible moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They've got us!" he was crying hoarsely: "They've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got us inside their circle at last--they're hammering us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to doom!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't we break out?" I cried: "Break through this</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle about us ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shook his head, his eyes burning: "No--their</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle is complete around us now and we'd only crash</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own cities to earth--but we'll try above and below!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the words, he gave a brief order and, as Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nell's voice flashed that order to all our confused mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cities, they leaped upward in sudden concerted mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, all their motors' energy turned suddenly into their</seg><seg type="columnLine">vertical lifting power. But, as they shot upward thus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to win free of the circle about us, that circle lifted at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same speed as our own mass, hovering still around</seg><seg type="columnLine">us and beating us still with all the relentless fire of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their massed batteries. And, when we shot suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward in an attempt to escape from below they</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank downward at as quick a speed, were encircling</seg><seg type="columnLine">us still. And now, beneath that awful hammering fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all the massed cities that enclosed us, our own were</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to stagger; to sway and reel!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The titanic circle of enemy air-cities about us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own great throng of cities, each a giant circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of belching flame, floating there miles above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth; the thunder of each city's giant batteries, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific brilliance of the storms of heat-shells that struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">from city to city; the great glowing craters of metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">that each striking shell made in a city, all these things</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed merged in the six periscopic screens that en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed us like some chaotic and meaningless panorama!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was aware of Yamall's agonized expression, as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">strove with every power that was ours to save our great</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-cities from destruction. For now in our cluster,</seg><seg type="columnLine">city after city was falling beneath that deadly fire of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusing shells. Los Angeles, Winnipeg, Panama, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nashville whirled down one after the other. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though our batteries were still thundering their roar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing answers, our surrounded cities were still striking</seg><seg type="columnLine">savagely out. with the colossal batteries of New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">still thundering loudest, I saw how swiftly we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">being annihilated! For, raging there in fearful battle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">high in the dusk between earth and stars, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">left now hardly more than sixty of our hundred air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities; while in the circle about us there still hung,</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite the giant blows we had struck them, a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">or more of the European and Asiatic cities! And with</seg><seg type="columnLine">all their guns thundering into us, the odds were swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">changing and becoming more in their favor 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally I stood up, as though jerked to my feet by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some strange force greater than myself, and wheeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the First Air Chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "It's the end now, Yarnall!" I cried to him above that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thunderous roar of battle that seemed splitting all the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">night about us: "The end for all our cities within an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hour if this keeps on!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The end!" he said, his own face grim: "But there's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">no escape--we can only meet it fighting!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  My eyes held his fixedly in that tense moment. "The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hundred cruisers in the plaza outside!"

You'll never make it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But it's our last chance!" I shouted to him as the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thunderous drumming of doom all about us deepened,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and two more of our cities crashed earthward. "It's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the one last chance to save our cities!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He paused there silent a second, then reached, wrung</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my hand tightly.

Two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of them leaped swiftly at my call, to the side of Yarnall</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to take the places of Connell and myself. And then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Macklin and Hilliard who had been working with them,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were running toward us also, and we four were run-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ning across the room and through the ante-rooms until</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we issued out from the electrostatic tower's base into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the great plaza.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Standing there in that plaza with the darkness gather-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing about us, there stretched from horizon to horizon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a boundless mass of gigantic light-gemmed cities, our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">own and the titanic ring that encircled us. The myriad</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lights of those cities, though, by which their gun-crews</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">worked the great batteries, were feeble in comparison</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the tremendous and blinding flares of brilliance in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all directions that were fountaining up in giant gouts</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of dazzling light. Across all those cities floating, there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">leaped and flew the heat-shell flares, and the thunder</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the guns was deafening, titanic, like the thunder of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a stream of falling worlds! Beneath that thunder</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there came to us thin, high cries, the wild cries of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crowds in the towers of cities and in their streets and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Elazas. And high, high above all these, far, far over-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ead, began to gleam the pale mocking eyes of the dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tant, watching stars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  All about us, in that moment that we burst out onto</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the plaza, it seemed that heat-shells were striking and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flaring. But the static-tower itself was of a composi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion that the shells could not harm, the rare refractory</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">alloy that in air-cities is used only for the vital power-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">towers. And, though shells had struck here and there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the plaza's edge and on its surface, though there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">, were on it and around it still-glowing craters of fusing</seg><seg type="columnLine">CITIES IN THE AIR	551</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">metal, few of the hundred close-massed cruisers that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">waited with their crews upon it had suffered serious</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">injury in the awful course of the battle so far. And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">now Macklin and Connell and Hilliard and I were racing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">across the plaza toward those cruisers, into the fore-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">most of them and up to its bridge-room. Then Macklin</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">jumped to the controls, as I called an order into the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">distance-phone over the titanic drumming of guns. In</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the next moment our hundred cruisers were driving</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up like mad things above the titanic battle raging there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up--up--through a wild inferno of rushing shells,</seg><seg type="columnLine">up over all the struggling, thundering, reeling cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">we sped, on the wild venture that was our last wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance. As we drove upward, I now saw others of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">central mass of air-cities falling. Atlanta and Cleveland</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mexico City were whirling downward, giant masses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of lights in which glowed countless great fusing craters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of metal, gyrating insanely down through the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">to crash in awful destruction on the surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">affrighted earth far below! Hardly more than a half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred, indeed, remained of all our air-cities now;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the odds against them swiftly lengthened, as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hammered still upon an anvil of fire and death by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the circle that hemmed them in. They were staggering</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever swifter, were reeling and swaying so that within</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few minutes, even as I had said, the remorseless fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">from all about them would send them to earth also, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wipe the last of the cities and peoples of the American</seg><seg type="columnLine">Federation from above the earth!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, as I saw that, our own cruisers were whirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">on above that giant central mass, toward the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring of enemy cities about them. Macklin at the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trols, with teeth set, sent our ship and those behind it</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving low above the awful combat with the storms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rushing shells from both sides thick about us. Ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">after ship behind us was flaring and fusing and falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">in white-glowing meteoric destruction, unnoticed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unheeded by any in the titanic thundering battle be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath ! On--on--we sped, rocketing through the night;</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemingly the only cruisers now in the air, since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two great fleets had all but annihilated themselves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet as we shot on, it seemed almost that no cruisers</seg><seg type="columnLine">could exist in the air over that great battle; since in</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozens, in scores, our own ships were falling, stricken</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the tempests of shells through which we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now we were reaching our goal, the giant Berlin</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hung there in the enemy's circle with all its mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">batteries thundering again our doomed cities. Down</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward it our cruisers swiftly rushed, unseen by any in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wild confusion that swept that city below us; down</seg><seg type="columnLine">until we saw plainly the terrific spectacle of thundering</seg><seg type="columnLine">batteries and wildly-rushing men. Here and there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat-shells bursting and flaring in dazzling death, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guns of our own cities roared savage answer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Down toward it moved our ships, now hardly more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a score in number, until there loomed just be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath us, that mighty central static-tower in which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been so recently imprisoned! As we shot down</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward it I beheld a glass ball above its tip, recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that as similar in purpose to the periscopic-screens</seg><seg type="columnLine">on our own tower's tip, and then we had shot down past</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, until our score of cruisers hoved beside the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower's side, at the fifth level.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hovering there in that moment beside the tower,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all the wild confusion raging beneath, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaza Wow still empty, we were still unseen by any</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath, by any in the great batteries that were thunder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing all around that plaza. Poised there in the darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">we could see that the windows beside us were bright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted ; that guards were swarming in the static-tower's</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper levels, rushing to and fro. Then as our cruiser's</seg><seg type="columnLine">door swung open, just level with a window beside us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Macklin and Connell and Hilliard and I were springing</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth from that door and across the narrow gap, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">that window, our heat-pistols ready in our hands! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same moment there burst after us our crew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from all the windows around that level, from all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cruisers hovering beside those windows, a stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">of black-uniformed Americans with heat-pistols in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands were pouring into the tower's fifth level 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly the guards in that level were snapping their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own weapons up toward us; but before they could fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">a score of cartridges from our pistols had flicked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flared among them. As they sank lifeless in scorched,</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned heaps of flesh we were racing through the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms and corridors of that level, killing the guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it with our heat-pistols, the surprise of our attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking them unawares. So awful was the drumming</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the titanic battle all around and outside, that no alarm</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our presence penetrated to the levels above and lie-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low us, and, now with the last of the guards wiped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that fifth level, I turned toward my three com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Connell and Hilliard! Take half our men and find</seg><seg type="columnLine">your places here in the tower, keeping anyone in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper levels from getting farther down than this!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Macklin, watch with our cruisers outside--at this low</seg><seg type="columnLine">height the batteries around the plaza can't reach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships, can't pivot toward you--and be ready to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone from getting into the tower from outside!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they whirled to obey my orders with the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of our men, some hundred and fifty in number,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was running toward the cage-lifts. With swift blows</seg><seg type="columnLine">we destroyed the controls that guided them from level</seg><seg type="columnLine">to level of the tower, and then we rushed toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow stairs that led also downward. Another mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and we were rushing down those stairs, while as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we did so there came a scuffle of battle above us, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we knew that the alarm had penetrated to the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">floors of the tower and that the guards there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">pouring down to battle with Connell and Hilliard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their men. We leaped on downward, though, down</seg><seg type="columnLine">until we had burst down into the fourth level. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">our surprise was as complete, and before the guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were aware of our presence, almost, we had sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">our heat-cartridges flaring among them, had swept them</seg><seg type="columnLine">from existence and were leaping down to the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">level. And in that it went the same; and in the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">below it, and then, with hearts pounding, we were rush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down into the first level!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we poured down into its anterooms, its guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed toward us and their own heat-pistols came up;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they too were falling in scorched heaps a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, and we were dashing through the anterooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the great circular inmost chamber that held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inmost controls of this great air-city of Berlin!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through those anterooms we burst, the surprised guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling lifeless and burnt before us, and then into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inmost circular room! All around its panelled walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved green-uniformed attendants who whirled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise from their switches and dials at our entrance;</seg><seg type="columnLine">while at the room's center there was what seemed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first to be a great dull-glass globe! We knew that that</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe enclosed within itself the great table-map and</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls of Berlin; and now there were bursting out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through an opening in that globe, the three green-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniformed men who had been within it--the First Air</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief of the European Federation and the two officers</seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">552</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">who with him had been controlling the movements of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the mighty combined European and Asiatic cities!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Captured City</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS the leader saw me, his swarthy face lit for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment with a flash of recognition, of astonishment;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then he and his fellows were leaping toward us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hands flashing down toward the heat-pistols at</seg><seg type="columnLine">their belts as the attendants around the room jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth their weapons also. But as they did so, our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat-pistols flashed up and for the next instant the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great room seemed full of flares of blinding light as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cartridges burst among them, sending them stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gering and swaying and falling in seared heaps! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted to my men swift orders that sent a score of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to the great switch-panels to take the places of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attendants there; while the remainder rushed toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great doors that opened from the tower's lowest</seg><seg type="columnLine">level into the plaza outside. Swiftly they closed those</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors, barred them and massed behind them, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was rushing toward the great dull-glass ball at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room's center.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inside that ball stood the great table-map upon its</seg><seg type="columnLine">great block, while beside it were the six levers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed-knob which controlled the speed and direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Berlin. As I took the seat before them now, I gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">about me, and saw that the great ball's interior was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in effect a great periscopic screen itself, one in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could gaze in any direction through the other great</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball above the static-tower's tip. And now, gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">into it around me there, I could see that in the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">night there stretched still the giant ring of the enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities, of which this Berlin was the heart, surrounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own survivors and hammering them still with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly fire which would soon bring them crashing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. Far out over that mighty field of battle, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant lights and blinding heat-flares stabbing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness, and its thunderous roar of guns shaking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, I could gaze; while even at the same moment I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard, high above, Connell and Hilliard and their men</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaged fiercely in holding the guards in the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower back. At the same instant came a sudden knock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, an alarmed rapping and then a battering and cry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of voices against the great tower's door from out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side; as the alarm spread from the tower's upper levels!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Disregarding all these things, I grasped the controls</seg><seg type="columnLine">before me, watching the scene all about the great city</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the periscopic ball about me. Swiftly I jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">open the speed-knob, at the same time slamming down</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the direction-levers; and, as I did so, I saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole great city of Berlin was soaring up now above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ring of cities in which it had hovered, until it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a little above their level. And then I thrust back</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lever in my hand and jerked down another; as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did so the mighty air-city of Berlin, the titanic air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">capital whose controls we had captured and which lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">now in my hands, was driving sidewise toward Geneva,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hung beside it in the ring. Toward it we sped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving at top speed toward it at a height a little above</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, so that our colossal base was on the level of Geneva's</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper towers. And with set teeth I drove Berlin on-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, and in the next moment its great base had sheared</seg><seg type="columnLine">right across the upper towers of Geneva, had mowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down those great towers like blades of wheat before</seg><seg type="columnLine">a reaper!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then as Berlin drove on from above it I saw Geneva</seg><seg type="columnLine">wavering in mid-air behind us for a moment, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashing down to earth through the night! I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">mowed away the great electro-static tower whose col-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lection of cosmic energy held it aloft, and Geneva went</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashing down to earth through the darkness like some</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant comet of blazing lights plunging to doom! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, beneath my hands, Berlin was driving still on-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward across and over that great ring of enemy cities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shearing now in the same way across the towers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">city upon city in that ring. Stockholm and Cape Town</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Bucharest fell as I mowed their power-towers from</seg><seg type="columnLine">them; and to them that awful spectacle of Berlin rush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing upon them and sending them to doom, crashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">across their great towers, must have been utterly stun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning and inexplicable in that wild moment!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On--on--around the great ring I held, almost insane</seg><seg type="columnLine">with wild fury and excitement in that moment of tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umph, driving through the night on our captured air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">city and sending city after city whirling to death. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dimly aware that the fighting above had ceased.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Connell and Hilliard and their men had wiped out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards in the tower above, and they had rushed down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to defend the electro-static tower's doors, against which</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wild battering was resounding now. Huge crowds</seg><seg type="columnLine">were surging madly against the tower as they felt their</seg><seg type="columnLine">great city rushing through the night and crashing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild destruction across their fellow-cities! But, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wild excitement that was surging through me now</seg><seg type="columnLine">I paid no attention to all about me; for surely I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying such colossal forces as no man ever had swayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The European and the Asiatic cities were breaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">from me, in wild panic, disorganized and shattered;</seg><seg type="columnLine">since there came now no commands to them from this</seg><seg type="columnLine">city of Berlin that had held their commander. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they broke into a disorganized mass, the half-hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">American cities massed in the center, who had seen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible havoc that Berlin, beneath my hands, was wreak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing upon their enemies, were themselves rushing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attack once more; and all their guns were thunder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing toward the disorganized mass of their enemies!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up toward Berlin from that mass as we rushed for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward there rose to meet us the giant air-capital of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peking, battered, scarred; its commander seeking to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay this crazy destruction its sister-capital was wreak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing upon their own forces. Up it came; and for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant it seemed that Berlin and Peking must crash</seg><seg type="columnLine">together bodily, but with a last wrench of the speed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">control I sent Berlin racing higher. And then, as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">met Peking, crashed over it, that mighty capital's power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower also, with its other clustered towers, was sheared</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it by our great base. Peking was wavering for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment and then went whirling down to death! Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as it wavered, slipped and fell, its great guns were</seg><seg type="columnLine">thundering savagely upon us until it had crashed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth far below!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Victory I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND now, down through the night upon the mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our enemy cities, I sent Berlin slanting down</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward them, at its full speed, and across them in a tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous ramming swoop that sheared the towers from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen of them, even as they attempted confusedly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise and meet the onthundering mighty city! Of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">confused, disorganized and broken mass there remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them at last hardly more than a score, still savagely</seg><seg type="columnLine">belching death from their guns toward our half-hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">American cities and still sending an occasional one</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward! But now as I whirled the giant mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berlin back toward them like a striking, gigantic bird of</seg><seg type="columnLine">prey, I was aware of a tremendous battering and clang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of metal; and at the same moment Hilliard was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting to me from the great doors that opened from</seg><seg type="columnLine">QTIES IN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the anterooms into the plaza.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''They're breaking down the doors, Brant!" he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">screaming above the wild thunder of battle and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamor of giant crowds that surged against those doors</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside: "Fight on, though--we'll try to hold them</seg><seg type="columnLine">back!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold them a moment longer!" I yelled back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him: "A moment more--!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For now I sent Berlin whirling downward in another</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific swoop across the mass of our enemy cities and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it sheared across half their mass, as they sought by</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising or sinking to avoid that deadly swoop. But a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-score were left of them now, and now the half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred cities of the American Federation had gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">about them and were hammering them with terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire. No gun sounded now on Berlin, all its crews and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers were rushing wildly across it toward the electro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">static tower, as the city whirled and crashed and fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ran there against their own allied cities! Caught in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrific fire of the cities around them, the half-score</seg><seg type="columnLine">European and Asiatic cities were going down with guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">thundering into annihilation. But now I was aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same moment of a terrific uproar there at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower's doors and of wild shouts and clanging blows</seg><seg type="columnLine">there as our men fought to hold back the madly surging</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowds outside!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gripping the levers before me for one last effort,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I jerked open the speed-control to its widest; and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it shot above the mass of the European and Asiatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities, only a half-dozen in number now, I whirled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty mass of Berlin down upon them in one last</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous swoop from which they sought in vain to</seg><seg type="columnLine">swerve. They too.were hesitating for a moment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then went whirling down to death, the last of the Europ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ean and Asiatic cities save for Berlin itself about me!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then, as I brought that city to a stay, with the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its companions crashing beneath and with the Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can cities hanging all about us now, there was a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">clang of falling metal at the tower's doors, and back</seg><seg type="columnLine">through them wild crowds without were pushing our</seg><seg type="columnLine">black-uniformed defenders!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Connell and Hilliard at their head, our men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">being pushed back through the ante-rooms, back toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great circular room in which I sat at the controls;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, as I gazed out through the opening in the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">periscope ball about me, I saw that an instant more</seg><seg type="columnLine">would see them overpowering the last of our men, rush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in upon me to take the city's controls once more!</seg><seg type="columnLine">But as I saw that, I reached forward, slammed down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lever that sent the city rushing downward! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped that lever and with a supreme effort tore it</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely from its socket! The next moment a wilder</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry came from the crowds fighting through the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the crowds over all the city outside, as they felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that city whirling and swaying beneath them, felt it</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling down to death through the night to annihi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lation !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as they uttered that tremendous cry, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying city flashed downward, their struggle at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door forgotten in that awful moment of doom, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware subconsciously that I was staggering with Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nell and Hilliard and our remaining men, up the nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row stair. Up to the great tower's second level and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its windows, beside which hung our cruisers with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Macklin and a skeleton crew, holding them there be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the tower even as the great city whirled with awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed downward! Then we jumped through those</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows into the cruisers. And the next moment, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the cruisers with ourselves inside them drove upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">like light from the falling city. Berlin had crashed into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE AIR	553</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth just beneath us, with a terrific, annihilating</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock that buckled it, broke it, made of it but a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted mass of rended metal 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then we were driving up toward the half-hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">remaining American air-cities that hung still high above,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant city of New York still at their center. Up</seg><seg type="columnLine">until we had soared above those cities and they lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath us, giant circles of brilliant light, scarred here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there with countless craters of fused metal! Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">great crowds of peoples had surged, now, from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">towers, out into their squares and streets. They gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if incredulously stunned by their deliverance, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty air and night about them, where so shortly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore had hung the enemy that had been sending them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to doom. In that moment, as we hung there high over</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, in that moment of incredible surprise and dawn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing joy, it seemed that all the world was silent after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrific thunder of that wild rushing battle that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">riven earth and sky so short a time before. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though the night, and the winds about us, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white stars overhead, were as silent with astonishment</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that moment as the crowds on the cities that hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">around and beneath us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then suddenly, from those cities, there was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up toward us as though from a single voice a single,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty cry!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dawnward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT dawn of the next day our half-hundred great</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-cities prepared to separate, to move back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">those positions that had been theirs before danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brought them together. Through all of that night</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had hung there together, their streets crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with weeping yet rejoicing crowds; and, now that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn showed them the green plains far beneath, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were beginning to depart. And we five, sitting there</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the periscopic screens in the power-tower of</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York, were watching them as they prepared to go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Battered and scarred, all of them, by that titanic</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle through which all had fought, many of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with great towers fused and broken, and scarred with</seg><seg type="columnLine">great craters, they were crowding toward us. Wash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ington was foremost among them, until it hung just</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside our city, its great streets and plazas thronged</seg><seg type="columnLine">with shouting crowds. And, in the wild shouts of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowds, we could hear our own names, their roaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribute. For, in their eyes, we had saved them by that</seg><seg type="columnLine">last wild effort of ours. And then Washington was</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving away from us, toward the southeast, speeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">away and vanishing as a dark spot in the southeastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now another was crowding beside us, and an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, and still they came. Pittsburgh and Guatemala,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tacoma, Chicago and Philadelphia, Rio de Janeiro,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kansas City and Vancouver--one by one they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving beside us, their giant bulks hanging beside New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York, their mighty cheers reaching us.

If a pilot could be found</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sayt positively that his plane bad been hit by</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning, Prof. Woodman says, then matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be different. A body must be heavily</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged with electricity for lightning to strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">it.

It is also clear that dirigible and</seg><seg type="columnLine">airplane are to be pitted against each other for</seg><seg type="columnLine">supremacy, and it is possible that they may de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velop into complements of each other. Diesel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">type engines, or possibly modified oil turbines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are being considered for .use for airplane pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsion.

It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not likely, according to Mr. Martyn, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">airplane will be able to carry the pay loads of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dirigible. On the other hand, the dirigible</seg><seg type="columnLine">can never expect to attain the speed of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">airplane. The dirigible will always have a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Greater flying range than the airplane, and will</seg><seg type="columnLine">: more spacious and luxurious; but the faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of the plane will permit it to outride a</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm faster than the dirigible and to land more</seg><seg type="columnLine">readily. A dirigible is apt to become helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a bad windstorm; but in the case of engine</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble it is much safer than a plane, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutt land, whereas the airship may remain aloft</seg><seg type="columnLine">until repairs have been effected.

The plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">is propelled from behind, and the main ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage of the plane will be the reduction in</seg><seg type="columnLine">air resistance due to the absence of the fuselage</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tail.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">factor which will have to be solved in connec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion with this type of plane is whether it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">better to have the propellers in front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wing, or behind it.

My vote is: Keei* Ur toe Serials. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">read and very much enjoyed "The Ark of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Covenant"--but I do not think I would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoyed it at all if it had been squeezed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">one issue of your magazine, along with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other stories. How could it be as interesting--</seg><seg type="columnLine">because half, over half of it, would be left out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order to do so, or else you would have had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to forego printing it. Why deprive the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tbe readers from reading a good story because</seg><seg type="columnLine">some man hasn't the patience to wait until it</seg><seg type="columnLine">ends? Mr. Kiessling's request is childish and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unreasonable, I think. Good stories should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">printed regardless of length--the longer it is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the more I # enjoy a fine story. Certainly, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good story is worth waiting lor, as all good</seg><seg type="columnLine">things arc. Oh, these men who haven't the</seg><seg type="columnLine">patience to wait for an ending to a story they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are reading--and so they think interesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories must be sacrificed because they cau't</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait until the end of three or four months I</seg><seg type="columnLine">There are plenty of short-story magazines on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the market if Mr. Kiessling wants to read</seg><seg type="columnLine">them--but don't by any means do away with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the serials--print at least two a month, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly don't object to three. Just so they</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain interesting, and anyhow, it gives one</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to look forward to eagerly every</seg><seg type="columnLine">month--not that the readers don't •'pester" the</seg><seg type="columnLine">postman or haunt the newsstauds waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">your two magazines to arrive. Let it not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that all men lack patience and I hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">that our readers will come forth with a loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Aye" for serials--and also members of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair sex, let it not be said that we women</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't patience either to wait for a good story.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Please pardon my criticism of your letter, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kiessling; but truly, you're unreasonable when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you expect a three- or four-month serial to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">crammed into one issue. It's evident that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story meets with your approval or you wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">get it every month.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As to your covers, both on Science Wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stories and Air Wonder Stories--they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelous.

You probably understand that oxygen is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the portion of the air which serves to "burn" a</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance; in the pure form, it brings about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid ignition with the release of such tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous energy that it causes an explosion as</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the union of oxygen and hydrogen.
