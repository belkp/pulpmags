That and fishing are my two recreations. </p><p>ADVENTURE has always been good, but I have been </p><p>looking for an opportunity to tell you that the last six </p><p>numbers have been the best all-fiction magazines that I </p><p>have ever read.” </p><p> We admitted it.</p><p> "And haven’t lots of people been finding it out?”</p><p> We cheerfully told him that our circulation was forty</p><p>per cent, larger now than a year ago, and that it had been </p><p>jumping ahead every month for the past six months. In </p><p>fact, we had every reason to expect that it would double </p><p>itself in a year. </p><p> "Then why don’t you shout it in the magazine,” said</p><p>he, "so that all your old friends may rejoice with you?” </p><p> You will find in this conversation, which is accurately reported,</p><p>the boast that we threatened to make on this page. We are delighted </p><p>to be able to make it. As it refers to circulation figures, which are </p><p>sometimes open to suspicion, we are hoping that you will receive it </p><p>not as a boast but as a cheerful bit of office gossip passed along to you. </p><p>Published by The Ridgway Company </p><p>EKMAN 1.

The waiting intermin- </p><p>ably prolonged because the man </p><p>did not know what was the thing he must </p><p>expect; terror more hideous than mere fear </p><p>because it was the unknown which menaced. </p><p> In all of the universe there was now only</p><p>this one thing which mattered; all else was </p><p>forgotten. And what was it? To the man </p><p>the desert in which he lay, helpless and </p><p>hopeless, had ceased to exist. He no longer </p><p>saw the hot sky, the molten sun, the limit- </p><p>less stretch of sand, cactus and blistering </p><p>rock. He saw only the eyes which watched </p><p>him. </p><p> They seemed staring at him terribly, two</p><p>eyes which were steady, unwinking, immea- </p><p>surable, inscrutable twin pools of ink. At </p><p>one instant they became to his fevered </p><p>fancy the fierce eyes of a savage, desert </p><p>born and bred, observing his death with a </p><p>curiosity at once unmoved and strangely </p><p>childlike. Then he thought that he saw </p><p>the eyes expand, dilate, grow enormous, </p><p>the eyes of some misshapen monster thing, </p><p>into whose lair he was the first man since </p><p>the first dawn to penetrate. Northrup’s </p><p>reeling brain groped insanely for the visuali- </p><p>zation of the great body to which the eyes </p><p>must belong, and which he could not see. </p><p> Then, with unconsciousness seeking to</p><p>cast its black mantle over the man who </p><p>struggled against it, the eyes seemed sud- </p><p>denly to change again, to grow smaller, </p><p>smaller, rounder, until they were the evil </p><p>eyes of the desert’s chief curse, Sika-tcua, </p><p>the yellow rattlesnake. He found himself </p><p>groping, wondering dully if there were truth </p><p>in the old tale, if a snake might charm a </p><p>man and draw him closer and ever closer </p><p>to the quick forked tongue? He set his two </p><p>hands out in front of his pain-twisted body, </p><p>sinking them in the blistering sand, seeking to </p><p>stop the impulse which had crept upon him. </p><p> He knew that the gray wolf at times came</p><p>down from the ridges; that the panther fol- </p><p>lowed the track of the mule-deer here; that </p><p>the gaunt, mean-spirited coyote was not</p><p>averse to sitting patiently and watching </p><p>the slow death of one of his superior ani- </p><p>mals, waiting.

Encompassed through the hesi- </p><p>tant hours by the material threats of the </p><p>desert, he had not once groaned. It was </p><p>Northrup’s way to suffer in silence. </p><p> But now the unknown had swept the last</p><p>vestiges of reality aside; it had the seeming </p><p>of creeping close about him from all quar- </p><p>ters of a veritable mundane hell. Half- </p><p>crazed with pain in the semi-consciousness </p><p>which he was always fighting for, it was as </p><p>if he had passed out of the old life already </p><p>and into a fierce land of sorcery. Of only </p><p>one thing could he be certain now—the pair </p><p>of steady black eyes watching him through </p><p>a fissure in the rocks above. </p><p> Had it been an hour since he had called</p><p>out? Or had many circling eons reeled </p><p>drunkenly over him since his voice, disturb- </p><p>ing the vast silence, had choked back into </p><p>his throat? He did not know. </p><p> He knew that he had called out, thinking</p><p>that these were the eyes of a man, a human </p><p>being like himself, that he had begged for </p><p>help. He knew that there had come no </p><p>answer, that the eyes had watched him </p><p>with the same steady curiosity. He knew </p><p>that he had shouted and that long ago he </p><p>had grown still. </p><p> Once he had painfully dragged from its</p><p>holster the automatic which had not been </p><p>shaken loose in his fall; when, with a blind </p><p>anger upon him, he had lifted it a little the </p><p>two eyes were gone. When it had fallen </p><p>from his weak grasp the two eyes were back </p><p>there, watching him with the same cursed </p><p>steadiness. </p><p> In a moment of half delirium the quick</p><p>suspicion had come to him that it was </p><p>Strang, Strang who had deserted him in his </p><p>helplessness, robbing him of the scant sup-</p><p>ply of water to drive on madly, seeking to </p><p>gain the next water-hole. But no; Strang </p><p>wouldn’t be tarrying here, watching him </p><p>die. Strang wouldn’t even be so much as </p><p>thinking of him. Strang was taking his own </p><p>chance, his one chance, and pushing on </p><p>desperately. </p><p> Northrup had lived through the day</p><p>praying dumbly for the coming coolness of </p><p>the night. Now the night was coming and </p><p>he was afraid of it. </p><p> He twisted his head a little to look at the</p><p>sun. He was less sure that the sun was </p><p>setting than that this was the last time he </p><p>would ever look upon it. In the west, a </p><p>riot of color; the sun was sinking through a </p><p>mist which seemed to rise from a sea of </p><p>blood. Night was at hand. And with the </p><p>sign of its coming the sense was strong upon </p><p>him of the unknown, terror-infested, creep- </p><p>ing closer about him. </p><p> “Strang might have waited,” he thought.</p><p> His swollen lips and dry, aching throat</p><p>were long ago past utterance. But he was </p><p>not past saying within himself: </p><p> “I won’t die until I know to what-</p><p>thing those eyes belong!” There was much </p><p>stubbornness in Sax Northrup. </p><p>IT WAS not meant that he should </p><p>die yet. And so he did not die. It </p><p>was meant that he should see Strang </p><p>again, that he should stumble upon a cen- </p><p>tury-long hidden secret of the desert. So </p><p>he lived on where another man would have </p><p>died. </p><p> The silver desert moon was two hours</p><p>high in the purple sky when he realized </p><p>that he had lost consciousness and found it </p><p>again. Before he thought of that he </p><p>thought of the eyes which had so long </p><p>watched him; before he saw the moon he </p><p>saw them. They were over him now, just </p><p>over him, less than a yard away. </p><p> He stared upward through the night light</p><p>curiously. There was sufficient light for </p><p>him to see clearly, but his brain cleared </p><p>slowly. </p><p> In seeking to guess the riddle of the two</p><p>eyes, to conjure up the thing to which they </p><p>belonged, he had never thought of a wo- </p><p>man. And yet a woman it was bending </p><p>over him, though his mind took long in clear- </p><p>ing enough for him to be sure of that. </p><p> She was old, unthinkably old, unbeliev-</p><p>ably ugly. She might have been the bar- </p><p>ren deity of a barren land. She might have </p><p>been a skeleton, with the skin upon the </p><p>fleshless skull tanned by sun and wind </p><p>through hundreds of years until it was </p><p>leather. Squatting motionless over him she </p><p>did not seem to be a living, breathing being </p><p>until he saw the eyes, the same steady, un- </p><p>winking black pools of ink with the glint of </p><p>the moon in them. </p><p>Y ahoya </p><p>5 </p><p> The moment was uncanny. The moon-</p><p>light dragged weird figures from the desert </p><p>floor, charging them with ghostly unreality. </p><p>The thing squatting above him might have </p><p>been a sister thing to the fantastic shapes </p><p>the moon made everywhere about her. </p><p> Northrup shivered. His reason, making</p><p>its way back through the darkness of his </p><p>stupor, had not fully reinstated itself. He </p><p>knew that here in this strange land of arid- </p><p>ity there could be no such thing as decom- </p><p>position. When death came it struck its </p><p>blow cleanly, unattended by decay. Air, </p><p>sun, wind, when they had their way undis- </p><p>puted, made of the dead such a thing as </p><p>that which bent over him. If no prowling </p><p>beast came to rend apart, then the body </p><p>would last throughout generations, perhaps </p><p>centuries. </p><p> Fear comes in many guises but never</p><p>with so cold a clutch as when whispering </p><p>of the supernatural. At the shock from the </p><p>pictures whipped up before him by his own </p><p>imaginings, Northrup again lost conscious- </p><p>ness. </p><p> Later—he did not know how much later</p><p>—it seemed quite natural for him to feel </p><p>that some one was moving about him. He </p><p>realized dimly that it couldn’t be Strang, </p><p>for Strang had gone on. He knew that it </p><p>must be the thousand-year-old woman who </p><p>had come out of the nowhere, riding on a </p><p>moon-ray, perhaps; who, when she was done </p><p>pottering around him, would go back the </p><p>way she had come. He didn’t try to turn </p><p>his head to watch her because he knew that </p><p>he hadn’t the strength left in him. </p><p> She had slipped something soft under his</p><p>shoulders, had even managed to turn his </p><p>great body a little, making it lie a fraction </p><p>less painfully. And she had brought him </p><p>water. That was a joke on Strang! He </p><p>had gone on furiously, lugging three or four </p><p>warm cupfuls in his canteen, thinking that </p><p>there was no other drop to be had until one </p><p>had crossed many miles of desert. </p><p> There came intervals during which</p><p>Northrup was oblivious to everything about </p><p>him, brief spaces of time when he awoke to </p><p>both realization and curiosity. But for the</p><p>most part he existed in a condition which </p><p>was a sort of dim border-line between con- </p><p>sciousness and stupor. He accepted the </p><p>present as matter of fact, forgot the past </p><p>and did not seek to speculate upon the fu- </p><p>ture. </p><p> For days he lay upon the talus, upon the</p><p>first of whose ragged boulders he had fallen </p><p>from the cliffs of porphyry above. The old </p><p>woman, moving with the feebleness and the </p><p>slowness of a Winter sunbeam, forced her </p><p>shaking hands to construct a shelter over </p><p>the spot where he lay. </p><p> A ragged, home-made cotton blanket</p><p>stretched above him from rock to rock, a </p><p>robe of rabbit-skins made at once cover and </p><p>bed. She brought him water in a rude olla </p><p>of sun-baked clay, administered gruelly </p><p>messes made from com-meal, attending him </p><p>after the first with a faithfulness like a shep- </p><p>herd dog’s. Where she went for the water, </p><p>what was the source of her food supply, he </p><p>did not know. </p><p> The silence was seldom broken. For</p><p>hours at a time she would squat near him, </p><p>her blanket drawn about her shoulders, over </p><p>her head, her hands lost in its folds, her </p><p>ancient face turned upon him in an expres- </p><p>sionless stare. When there arose absolute </p><p>need for speech there was no difficulty in </p><p>understanding each other. </p><p> Northrup, through many years of going</p><p>up and down among people of her breed, </p><p>had come to understand the tongue of the </p><p>Indians of Walpi, Oraibe, Taos. When he </p><p>had called her “So Wuhti,” which is the </p><p>Hopi for Old Woman or Grandmother, she </p><p>had understood. She had named him “Ba- </p><p>liana,” White Man, and the ceremony of </p><p>introduction was complete. </p><p> For a long time Northrup, lying grim and</p><p>quiet, thought that by struggling to keep </p><p>on living he was but postponing the hour </p><p>of his death a few hours. Among his lesser </p><p>injuries he thought that he could count the </p><p>fracture of his left arm. He could only </p><p>speculate upon the extent of injury done </p><p>internally. </p><p> Had he been in a hospital with capable</p><p>physician and nurses attending him there </p><p>might be a chance. But here, with the half-</p><p>cooked food a wild woman brought, with </p><p>the nauseating decoctions which she ex- </p><p>tracted from he knew not what plants or </p><p>roots, with a bed of lava rock, his chance </p><p>seemed little enough. He watched her mak- </p><p>ing his medicines, heating the sticky liquid </p><p>over a greasewood fire, then setting it aside </p><p>that she might sing over it and so make it </p><p>“good medicine,” and imagined that the </p><p>mixture would be about as efficacious as her </p><p>singing. The latter was horrible enough. </p><p>But he got well. </p><p> And they grew to be companions of a</p><p>6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>sort, as perhaps nearly any two of God’s </p><p>creatures would if set alone in the world. </p><p>The fact that the old hag was living here </p><p>and absolutely alone, that she seemed con- </p><p>tented to be here and looked for no other </p><p>company than her own until Northrup had </p><p>come, aroused curiosity after a little. </p><p> He soon found many questions to ask.</p><p>And during the five months which passed </p><p>before he was a strong man again—and one </p><p>must be certain of his full strength before </p><p>he seeks to walk out into the desert with </p><p>the little water he can carry and the </p><p>knowledge that he must travel forty miles </p><p>to the first water-hole—he learned much </p><p>from So Wuhti. </p><p>II </p><p> HAD not So Wuhti led him at last</p><p>to her abode, Northrup would never </p><p>have found it. It was slow climb- </p><p>ing for them both, the woman weighted </p><p>down by close to a century of years, the </p><p>man still so weak that a little exertion set </p><p>him trembling throughout his wasted body. </p><p> The chosen chamber of So Wuhti was</p><p>close up to the cliff-tops, a roughly gouged- </p><p>out room in the rocks, to be approached </p><p>only by a steep trail from below. It was </p><p>constructed cunningly in a great fissure so </p><p>that while from it the old woman might </p><p>look out over the desert, it would be a keen </p><p>eye down there to discover her. </p><p> Upon the floor lay So Wuhti’s bed, a</p><p>tumbled pile of cotton blankets of native </p><p>weave and a rabbit-skin robe. In a smoke- </p><p>blackened corner were a few charred sticks </p><p>and bits of brush; here and there were sun- </p><p>baked clay utensils, for the most part black </p><p>and cracked. A few strings of dried meat, </p><p>a heap of shelled corn, a pot of water, a </p><p>prayer-stick against the wall by the bed </p><p>completed the equipment of the room. </p><p> From So Wuhti’s boudoir—Northrup al-</p><p>ways called it that and So Wuhti seemed </p><p>greatly pleased with the name—it was no </p><p>trick to come to the top of the cliffs by </p><p>means of the short ladder. And here one </p><p>came upon that wonder of the desert of </p><p>which a thousand tongues have told since</p><p>first the old Spanish conquistadores dipped </p><p>into it, which countless artists have sought </p><p>to catch upon their brushes. </p><p> For a hundred miles in all directions the</p><p>eye passed over gray floor, sweeping up into </p><p>loma and mesa, the magic desert colorings </p><p>over it all, deep blues and glittering bronzes, </p><p>the snow white of drifted sands, the gray- </p><p>green of cactus and brush, the brick reds of </p><p>rocky precipices. Through the clear, dry </p><p>air the eye sped instantly over waterless </p><p>distances where a man might find slow </p><p>death in crossing. </p><p> Here, just at the cliff’s edge, Northrup</p><p>found again the half-expected, the tumbled </p><p>ruins of an ancient watch-tower. His mind </p><p>toyed with the pictures which his fancies </p><p>suggested. </p><p> The vision arose of a gaunt, cat-quick sen-</p><p>tinel, hawk-eyed, skin beaten into glistening </p><p>copper from the sun, keeping guard here </p><p>while his brothers slept in a younger cen- </p><p>tury; starting up as, many miles away </p><p>across the rolling floor of desert sand and </p><p>scrubby growth he caught a quick glimpse </p><p>of an invading enemy; cupping his hands to </p><p>his mouth to send outward and downward </p><p>his warning shout; kindling the ever-ready </p><p>pile of greasewood fagots to send out over </p><p>the land other messages of warning, voice- </p><p>less, lightning-winged. And, as if the old </p><p>time were not yet dead though the watch- </p><p>tower of stone was crumbling, he saw a pile </p><p>of dry greasewood and a black smudge of </p><p>smoke against the side of the one upstand- </p><p>ing slab of stone. </p><p> He went back, down to So Wuhti, won-</p><p>dering. </p><p> As,little by little, strength came back into</p><p>his emaciated body, he grew impatient for </p><p>the time when he might dare to take up the </p><p>trail again. But a month passed and he </p><p>knew that it would be as mad a thing to </p><p>try to move on as to climb to the cliff-tops </p><p>and leap downward. </p><p> There was water here; So Wuhti brought</p><p>it laboriously from a hidden spring far back </p><p>and deep down in the great fissure in the </p><p>rock wall. If he turned back, he knew </p><p>there was no more water within thirty miles; </p><p>if he went on it was a gamble if he would</p><p>find water at the end of forty miles. So he </p><p>waited for his strength to come back to </p><p>him. </p><p> Slowly, so slowly that perhaps she was</p><p>never aware of it, So Wuhti’s silence slip- </p><p>ped from her. She came, in her loneliness, </p><p>to feel a strange affection for the big-bodied </p><p>Bahana with his white skin, his yellow hair </p><p>and blue eyes. </p><p> She had never seen a man like him. At</p><p>first she seemed a little in awe of him, a lit- </p><p>tle afraid of him. In those first weeks she </p><p>Yahoya </p><p>7 </p><p>would sit and watch him suspiciously, her </p><p>lips locked, her eyes bright with speculation. </p><p> But, as the Hopi legends have it, woman</p><p>is the daughter of Yahpa, the Mocking- </p><p>bird, and so, since her father is so great a </p><p>talker, may not long remain silent. The </p><p>legends of her forefathers were scripture to </p><p>So Wuhti. </p><p> So it turned out that as they sat together</p><p>in the old woman’s boudoir or upon the </p><p>cliff-tops, the slow hours passed to the </p><p>throaty monotone of So Wuhti’s talk while </p><p>Northrup smoked her tobacco in his pipe </p><p>and listened. It took him no great time to </p><p>recognize the fact that the old woman was </p><p>half crazed—a brooding, solitary life and a </p><p>mind filled with superstitions having worked </p><p>their way with her. </p><p> In the main her conversation was an in-</p><p>genious fabric of lies told with rare sem- </p><p>blance of truth. As if she were recounting </p><p>some minor happening of the day, she told </p><p>of a visit she had had from Haruing Wuhti, </p><p>chief deity of the Hopi polytheism. The </p><p>goddess, coming up out of the sea, had </p><p>come across the desert, running swifter than </p><p>an antelope. So beautiful was she that she </p><p>had hurt So Wuhti’s eyes with her beauty. </p><p>Aliksail Listen, Bahana! She is like a soft </p><p>white maiden, Haruing Wuhti, her hair yel- </p><p>low like the squash blossom, yellower than </p><p>yours. Her eyes are like turquoises, her </p><p>mouth as red as a sunset through the sand- </p><p>storm. She came swiftly at So Wuhti’s </p><p>call. Through the night the goddess sat </p><p>there, So Wuhti here, and they talked. </p><p> So Wuhti shook her head, mumbled, grew</p><p>silent. The Bahana was not to hear the </p><p>things of which Haruing Wuhti and So </p><p>Wuhti spoke in the night. </p><p> She explained her presence alone here.</p><p>She told him of it twice, once in answer to </p><p>his question, once volunteering the infor- </p><p>mation. Had she gone into the matter a </p><p>third time Northrup had no doubt that he </p><p>would then have had three instead of mere- </p><p>ly two distinct explanations to choose from. </p><p> In the first account Northrup found many</p><p>traces of ancient Indian religions. So Wuhti</p><p>spoke familiarly of the beginnings of the </p><p>world which, while she admitted that it was </p><p>Haruing Wuhti and the Sun who had done </p><p>the actual work, she herself witnessed. </p><p> She called Northrup’s attention to the</p><p>fact that the spot in which he and she were </p><p>was the top of the world. Hence it became </p><p>clear that it was very distantly remote from </p><p>the abiding-place of the chief goddess. Be- </p><p>ing so far away the goddess must have some </p><p>one in whom she could trust to see that </p><p>everything went right. Consequently So </p><p>Wuhti, a very great favorite with Haruing </p><p>Wuhti, was stationed here. When there </p><p>was need she built signal fires at the ruined </p><p>watch-tower and Haruing saw and under- </p><p>stood the matter. </p><p> If Northrup didn’t take a great deal of</p><p> stock in this explanation, he had the other</p><p> one: Further in the desert, so far and across</p><p> such a waterless tract that the white man</p><p> could only send his hungry eyes traveling</p><p> into it, was a land where there were hidden</p><p> cities. The gods of the underworld had</p><p> built these cities. Then they had given</p><p> them to a people, the people of So Wuhti.</p><p> There were seven of these cities, the Sev-</p><p> en Cities of Chebo. (Northrup smiled as</p><p> he saw a trace of the old legend told by the</p><p> early Spanish explorers of the Seven Cities</p><p> of Cibola.) They were very rich cities, hav-</p><p> ing much silver, many turquoises and of</p><p> late years much gold, which they made into</p><p> rings and bracelets, the chiefs having cups</p><p> and plates of gold.</p><p> In order that they might remain hidden</p><p> from the greed of the white men and from</p><p> the jealousy of other tribes, they set senti-</p><p> nels out through the desert, a hundred</p><p> miles away. Such a sentinel was So Wuhti.</p><p> She had but to set fire to the fagots upon</p><p> the cliffs and the chiefs of the Hidden Cities</p><p> of Chebo would understand.</p><p> Northrup must understand that the gods</p><p> and goddesses were very close to the people</p><p> of So Wuhti. Didn’t Haruing Wuhti her-</p><p> self come here to chat with So Wuhti, to eat</p><p> piki with her? It was so.</p><p> And by living here alone So Wuhti was</p><p>doing a kindness at once to her people of </p><p>'Chebo and to her sovereign deity. The</p><p>priest had told her. As long as she lived </p><p>she would watch here. When she was to </p><p>die she would build a big fire which would </p><p>carry the word across the desert so that </p><p>another might be sent to take her place. </p><p>And then Haruing Wuhti would come for </p><p>her and throw her cloak about her and So </p><p>Wuhti would be a young mana again, living </p><p>always where the Big River breaks through </p><p>the crust and goes into the underworld </p><p>where the gods live. </p><p> Though the old woman’s rambling stories</p><p> with their innumerable digressions and</p><p> repetitions soon ceased to interest him,</p><p>8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Northrup did not fill his canteen and move </p><p>on when at last he felt that he was his old, </p><p>strong self. Half-crazed old savage that </p><p>she was, So Wuhti was none the less hu- </p><p>man. Nor was there any denying his obli- </p><p>gation to her. Had it not been for her he </p><p>would be now only what the coyotes and </p><p>strong-beaked birds would have left of him. </p><p>And now, strong enough to attempt the </p><p>passage of the desert, he could not fail to </p><p>see that So Wuhti was coming quickly to </p><p>the end of her life, and he could not bear </p><p>the thought of going on heartlessly, leaving </p><p>her to die alone. </p><p>SHE looked at him curiously many </p><p>times during those last few days to- </p><p>gether. She, too, had seen her death </p><p>coming to her at last and looked at it with </p><p>steady, curious eyes. She was not afraid, </p><p>she did not seem sorry to go. She was cer- </p><p>tain that Haruing Wuhti was making her </p><p>future existences her own concern. It was </p><p>all arranged. </p><p> She had never manifested a hint of emo-</p><p>tion of any kind since he had seen her beady </p><p>eyes peering at him through the crack in </p><p>the rocks and now he had been here upward </p><p>of six months. He did not expect for a sign </p><p>of emotion now. Too long had she had the </p><p>opportunity of looking forward to the end </p><p>to be greatly perturbed by it now that it </p><p>was at hand. </p><p> It came with a little shock to him one</p><p>day that So Wuhti was all human, after </p><p>all. Out of a still silence by the ruined </p><p>tower she had moved to him quickly, her </p><p>crooked claw of a hand suddenly fastening </p><p>about his forearm. </p><p> “You’re a good man, Bahana,” she said,</p><p>her eyes unusually bright upon his. “Many </p><p>days ago you were ready to go. You wait </p><p>that So Wuhti does not die alone like the </p><p>coyote. Askwalil I thank you. Haruing </p><p>Wuhti will bring you many good things. I </p><p>will tell her.” </p><p> With all of her madness she was not with-</p><p>out wisdom. She set her chamber in order </p><p>that night; Northrup had the suspicion that </p><p>in honor of the occasion she even went so </p><p>far as to bathe. Then, when the first stars</p><p>were coming out she made a trembling way </p><p>to the cliff-tops, Northrup helping her up </p><p>the short ladder. </p><p> In the faint light here Northrup saw how</p><p>she had arranged her hair, and the thing </p><p>came to him with something of a shock. </p><p>She had done it up into two whorls, one at </p><p>each ear, the imitation of the squash blos- </p><p>som which with the Zuni people tells the </p><p>time when a maiden has ripened into the </p><p>first blush of womanhood. So Wuhti was </p><p>ready for the coming of Haruing Wuhti, for </p><p>the time when again she would be beauti- </p><p>ful—a young mana. </p><p> When at last the great fire, which at her</p><p>command he had kindled, had burnt down, </p><p>Northrup went slowly back into the stone </p><p>chamber which had so long been So Wuhti’s </p><p>and which was never again to know her </p><p>presence. As he looked at her blankets laid </p><p>in order, folded by hands into which the </p><p>chill had already crept, when he saw the </p><p>broken jugs and crocks set in their neat </p><p>row, a sudden moisture came into his eyes. </p><p>So Wuhti had been good to him and she </p><p>was dead. So Wuhti was gone and he was </p><p>lonely! </p><p> In the coolness of the night, having only</p><p>the stars to guide him, his canteen freshly </p><p>filled, he pushed on, out into the desert. </p><p>Ill </p><p>ONLY because of the great stub- </p><p>bornness which was a part of him, </p><p>and because of the unswerving pur- </p><p>pose which had grown to be a part of that </p><p>stubbornness, did Sax Northrup battle on </p><p>with the desert instead of turning back </p><p>now. For fight was it to be at every step, </p><p>with the ultimate outcome hidden upon the </p><p>knees of the barren gods of the Southwest- </p><p>ern Sahara. </p><p> Already was he in a land into which men</p><p>do not come, where perhaps before him ten </p><p>white men had not ventured since the time </p><p>of Fray Marcos close to four hundred years </p><p>ago. Here was a region from which a man </p><p>might bring back with him nothing but a </p><p>tale of suffering; where often enough he </p><p>might find nothing but a horrible death. </p><p>And yet Northrup, seeking that which he </p><p>sought, with his eyes open went on.</p><p> But, thinking that he knew the desert,</p><p>he came to learn that he had never known </p><p>it. Alone in the silence he came to under- </p><p>stand a little the majesty and power of God. </p><p> Day after day, night after night, he saw</p><p>these things made tangible in the sweep of </p><p>the sandy floor, in the stern grandeur of the </p><p>uplifted walls of rock. Through the frag- </p><p>ment of eternal silence through which he </p><p>fought his way he felt these things. He </p><p>Yahoya </p><p>9 </p><p>felt himself a small figure alone in a strange, </p><p>hard world. </p><p> Grandeur, majesty, sublimity—he knew</p><p>them to be of the desert. But they were </p><p>not the essence of it. Its supreme quality, </p><p>seen at all times and not to be mistaken, </p><p>was its savage fierceness. The desert is no </p><p>hypocrite; its teeth are always bared, poi- </p><p>soned teeth in a snarl at the intruder, </p><p>threatening no less its own offspring. It is </p><p>the land of the iron fang. </p><p> As he battled on, always was he in the</p><p>heart of another battle which had outworn </p><p>the youth of time. A struggle to the death, </p><p>without quarter, and oh, the silence of it! </p><p>Here about him was no created thing which </p><p>the desert did not strive to kill. Here was </p><p>no living thing upon all the terrible surface </p><p>which did not strive to kill its brother crea- </p><p>tion. </p><p> Life here had never gotten beyond its</p><p>primary, elemental phase. It was, over and </p><p>over, the frenzied seeking to inflict death </p><p>in order that the conqueror might live; to </p><p>live in order to kill; to deal death and to flee </p><p>from death. </p><p> The fierce brood of things struggling for</p><p>existence even from the very womb of their </p><p>terrible mother were without exception a </p><p>brood armored and armed, the desert coy- </p><p>ote a murderer with a coward’s heart and a </p><p>madman’s cunning; the wildcat a machine </p><p>for assassination; the gray wolf so much </p><p>cold steel, tireless, swift, merciless, the spir- </p><p>it of slaughter cast into flesh and blood; the </p><p>rattlesnake as deadly as death itself; even </p><p>the harsh growth of vegetation, bound to </p><p>earth by its iron roots so that it might not </p><p>spring to attack or flee from its enemy, was </p><p>armed with its thousand knife-thorns to tear </p><p>at flesh and bite at bone. </p><p> Everywhere Northrup sensed the silent,</p><p>unending struggle, the preying of living </p><p>things upon one another, the warring of the </p><p>land which bore them against them all. </p><p>And he came to know what it meant for a </p><p>human being to enter this scene of natural </p><p>warfare. </p><p> Like the man and wife in Moliere’s com-</p><p>edy, fighting like cat and dog but ready to </p><p>turn united against the interloper into their </p><p>domestic realm, so these desert things seem- </p><p>ed to combine with horrible power against </p><p>the stranger in their realm, the Bahana who </p><p>had dared set foot upon the changing sands. </p><p>The sun tortured him, thirst came to mad- </p><p>den him, spiked cacti tore at his bleeding </p><p>hands, wind parched, sand blinded him, the </p><p>rattlesnake and the poisoned spiders threat- </p><p>ened when he slept or woke. </p><p> As the still, hot days went on he came al-</p><p>most to believe himself in a veritable land </p><p>of sorcery, of witchcraft, of black magic. </p><p>It became to him the demesne of the un- </p><p>earthly, the home of illusion, a region be- </p><p>witched and bewitching him who looked </p><p>upon it, the one place in the world where </p><p>the supernatural was a part of nature. </p><p> He saw the sun changed into a monster</p><p>bloodstone, the moon into a disk of white </p><p>silver, the sober skies into a riot of colors, </p><p>burning reds, rich purples, greens and golds. </p><p>His eyes told him of a stretch of level lands </p><p>which were to be crossed in two hours and </p><p>he struggled across them for two days; told </p><p>him of mountains five miles away which his </p><p>brain, wise from past experience, knew were </p><p>seventy miles from him. </p><p> He walked toward misty veils of pale</p><p>pink and deep rose; they melted away from </p><p>him, withdrawing, showing him the barren </p><p>places which had been softened only in the </p><p>seeming. He saw things which did not ex- </p><p>ist, built out of nothingness as by the touch </p><p>of a magician’s wand, hovering in the air. </p><p>What looked like a lake before him, cool </p><p>waters stirring softly to a cool breeze, was </p><p>nothingness, a bit of trickery of the air. </p><p>To see trees, mountains where they were </p><p>not, turned topsy-turvy, became a common- </p><p>place. </p><p> There was one day when, hoarding the</p><p>little water in his canteen, hurrying on to </p><p>the vague promise of a water-hole, he saw </p><p>quick clouds gathering in the sky, black </p><p>with the rain in them. Caught in a driving </p><p>current high above, the clouds passed over </p><p>him. Saturated, struck by a cooler current </p><p>of air, they burst open like huge water-bags, </p><p>spilling the rain. He saw it fall in a steep </p><p>slant. It was raining up there in big drops. </p><p>And yet no single drop of water came down</p><p>to him. In the dry air through which it </p><p>plunged hissing downward it disappeared, </p><p>drunk up by the air itself as a drop of mois- </p><p>ture is drunk up by a dry sand bank. Mere- </p><p>ly the natural thing here, yet looking like </p><p>enchantment. </p><p> Northrup was a man essentially given to</p><p>strong, vigorous action rather than to fan- </p><p>ciful musings. And yet here, with aught of </p><p>action denied him beyond the monotonous </p><p>driving of one boot after the other into loose </p><p>sand, or up lava-strewn slopes, or about and </p><p>10 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>through clumps of desert vegetation, for </p><p>weeks his mind was the home of strange </p><p>imaginings. </p><p> He found himself wondering, at first light-</p><p>ly, but at times with a soberness which </p><p>startled him when he recognized it, if there </p><p>did exist supernatural forces of which man </p><p>had no understanding. The thought came </p><p>to him that such a force had drawn him, </p><p>Sax Northrup, from the beaten thorough- </p><p>fares of white men into this empty land. </p><p>What had brought him here while tie men </p><p>whom he had known of his class and type </p><p>were driving their motors over smooth </p><p>roads, dining in comfortable cafes, sleeping </p><p>upon soft beds and otherwise disporting </p><p>themselves as befitted the city-bred? What </p><p>indeed but the wild tale of a dying Indian </p><p>down in Santa Fe? </p><p> The thing which takes men by the hair</p><p>and drags them to the hidden corners of the </p><p>four quarters of the world is generally the </p><p>same thing in whatever garb it chooses to </p><p>wear—the lure of gold. It had brought </p><p>him, him and Strang, here. </p><p> Through many a day there stood between</p><p>Northrup and death a scrap of paper and a </p><p>hope that the paper did not lie. In the </p><p>main it had told the truth thus far. If, </p><p>later on, it lied to him, why, then he’d do </p><p>what many another man has done on the </p><p>desert, die for want of water. </p><p> He had the way, before leaving any</p><p>water-hole upon which he had come, of </p><p>taking the paper out of his pocket, studying </p><p>it thoughtfully, looking up from it across </p><p>the bleak stretches, out toward a steep- </p><p>walled mesa or the clear-cut ridges of dis- </p><p>tant mountains. And always his frowning </p><p>eyes camc back from the old story of sand, </p><p>lava-rock, gorge, precipice and gray-green </p><p>desert growth to the bit of paper in his </p><p>hand. </p><p> Already was it more precious to him than</p><p>the gold which he hoped it might lead him </p><p>to. </p><p> “For if through some mischance I should</p><p>lose this,” he admitted to himself often </p><p>enough, “why, then, I’d be a dead man in</p><p>forty-eight, maybe in twenty-four hours!” </p><p>A STRANGE map this, which </p><p>Northrup carried rolled and thrust </p><p>into an empty rifle-cartridge for </p><p>safety. That he had made it himself did </p><p>not in any way make it seem to him infal- </p><p>lible. </p><p> The Indian, dying in Santa F6, had told</p><p>him the way to follow and Northrup had </p><p>made the rough map from the Indian’s </p><p>words. And he had known, from the time </p><p>that he made his first step upon the long </p><p>trail, that, trusting himself upon it, having </p><p>only that to guide him deep into the secret </p><p>heart of the land of little water, was as fool- </p><p>hardy a thing as he had ever done in all </p><p>the years of a foolhardy existence. But </p><p>there had been the golden lure. </p><p> As he crouched by some lonely water-</p><p>hole, trying to get his big body into a scant </p><p>patch of shade, his eyes turned upon his </p><p>crude map, Northrup’s thoughts had grown </p><p>into the way of flying back to the manner </p><p>of this thing coming to him at all. </p><p> He had been in Santa Fe, chafing under a</p><p>short enforced idleness, restive, eager for </p><p>whatever might come next on the cards. </p><p>There he had found Strang; or to be exact </p><p>Strang had found him. Northrup hadn’t </p><p>particularly liked him from the beginning. </p><p>But men of his class were few and hard to </p><p>find hereabouts and Strang was not with- </p><p>out a certain insinuating way and a per- </p><p>severance almost as great as Northrup’s </p><p>own. </p><p> Besides, Strang in the beginning of the</p><p>matter had been in trouble and Northrup </p><p>in his wide-handed, generous way had be- </p><p>friended him. The ridding oneself of a </p><p>person to whom one has done a kindness is </p><p>not without its difficulties. </p><p> At any rate Northrup and Strang had</p><p>been together watching a game of cards in </p><p>an adobe saloon when the Indian had first </p><p>come into their stories. The native, a tall, </p><p>gaunt, sinewy fellow thrusting through a </p><p>knot of men at the door had come almost </p><p>at a run to where they were. </p><p> “Sax Northrup?” he had asked swiftly.</p><p> Even before Northrup could answer, there</p><p>came a little whirring sound and a small ar- </p><p>row, tipped with a blue feather, evidently </p><p>fired through the open window from with- </p><p>out, drove deep into the Indian’s side. His </p><p>eyes, turned toward the square of dark- </p><p>ness, were horrible. And Northrup, bend- </p><p>ing over him quickly, had seen no pain, </p><p>just wicked, venemous hatred in them. </p><p>The arrow was poisoned and the wounded </p><p>man knew it. </p><p> In a little room just off the saloon the</p><p>Indian told his story to Northrup and </p><p>Strang. To the latter because he asked to </p><p>stay, since the Indian made no objection, </p><p>Yahoya </p><p> ii</p><p>t </p><p>because Northrup had no reason for privacy </p><p>in the matter. </p><p> That night the Indian died. But first</p><p>he had told his story. Northrup, looking </p><p>his incredulity, saw a keenness of eagerness </p><p>in Strang’s eyes. And in the end the Indian </p><p>convinced them both. </p><p> “Look!” he had panted, speaking as swift-</p><p>ly as he might in the Hopi tongue. “There </p><p>is more—like this!” </p><p> He had managed to squirm over on his</p><p>bed, jerking weakly at something tied about </p><p>his body under his shirt. It was Strang’s </p><p>eager hands which did the actual work. </p><p>There was a little bag there, made rudely </p><p>from a piece of buckskin. And in the bag </p><p>were two gold nuggets and half a dozen </p><p>turquoises. </p><p> “But why do you give this to me?”</p><p>Northrup had demanded. “You came here </p><p>looking for me. I don’t know you.” </p><p> “I know you,” the Indian had answered.</p><p>“Where hard things get done, I hear your </p><p>name. Where dangerous things are, I hear </p><p>your name. A man must be like you to go </p><p>there. Now listen: get paper quick; make </p><p>marks on it while I tell you.” </p><p> And so Northrup had made his map.</p><p> “It is many miles, more than two hun-</p><p>dred, before you come to the beginning of </p><p>the trail,” the Indian had said. “Red Rock </p><p>Gully, you know? And Badger Gulch be- </p><p>yond, and Coyote Gap on the other side, </p><p>they are known to you.” </p><p> “Yes,” Northrup had answered.</p><p> “Then, Bahana, listen. Listen with both</p><p>ears!” </p><p> He made his description of the trail to</p><p>travel swiftly, seeming to have each great </p><p>or minor direction in mind, as if he had </p><p>carefully arranged every detail already. </p><p>From Coyote Gap Northrup was to go </p><p>straight toward the rising sun where it lift-</p><p>ed between the two peaks in the Spanish </p><p>Mountains, the peaks known as Los Dos </p><p>Hermanos. There, in the pass, was water. </p><p>It was not over ten miles from Coyote Gap. </p><p> Then, before going further, the Indian</p><p>had wriggled up, his back against the wall, </p><p>and had seized pencil and paper from North- </p><p>rup. </p><p> “Look,” he had said, making a little</p><p>mark. “This is where the north star is. </p><p>You can always find the place of the Kwinae </p><p>Wuhtaka—North Old Man—on the desert? </p><p>Day and night, by the stars?” </p><p> Northrup nodded. Already he had be-</p><p>gun to feel something of the earnestness </p><p>which seemed to possess the Indian and </p><p>which at the jump had gotten into Strang’s </p><p>blood. The Indian grunted his satisfaction. </p><p> “Now,” the Hopi had said at the end,</p><p>showing the same readiness which So Wuhti </p><p>showed months later to meet the Skeleton </p><p>Old Man half-way, “it is done. You will go, </p><p>for there is gold at the end of it all, and </p><p>where there is gold, if it is under hot rocks, </p><p>a white man will go. The other Bahana,” </p><p>looking shrewdly into Strang’s brightening </p><p>eyes, “will go also. You will make two </p><p>writings, so that if the wind steals one you </p><p>will not die for water.” </p><p> “Oh, I suppose we’ll go,” had been North-</p><p>rup’s answer. “But look here, my friend— </p><p>I want to know what’s back of this? Why </p><p>are you so infernally set upon anybody </p><p>using the stuff you can’t use yourself?” </p><p> The Hopi’s last earthly grin was full of</p><p>malice. </p><p> “It is because I hate Tiyo,” had been</p><p>the full of his explanation. </p><p>IV </p><p>THE question, “Who the devil is </p><p>Tiyo?” had come quite naturally to </p><p>Northrup’s lips when he had first </p><p>heard the name. But now it had long ago </p><p>been crowded aside, all but forgotten. In </p><p>due time he’d know, or else he’d never </p><p>know', and in the meantime he had other </p><p>matters to ponder upon. </p><p> It had been at a spot some ten miles in a</p><p>general northeasterly direction from the </p><p>point indicated on his map by the words </p><p>“Canon—Pines—Mountain Ridge,” that he </p><p>had had his mishap. Here Strang had left </p><p>him. Here So Wuhti had appeared before </p><p>him like a black witch, to become his good </p><p>angel. </p><p> When he had pushed on again he had</p><p>found that, day after day, the country un- </p><p>folding before him became more menacing. </p><p>He found no water of any description, ex- </p><p>cepting at those spots where little crosses </p><p>upon his map indicated it. He slept and </p><p>woke with the knowledge that should he </p><p>miss one of these holes, should the Indian </p><p>have lied to him, should the drifting sands </p><p>have covered and blotted out a spring, why </p><p>then the tale was told for Sax Northrup. </p><p> And there was another thing, a thing</p><p>which multiplied a hundredfold the danger </p><p>which lay about him: While the figures </p><p>12 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>upon his map told him definitely that it </p><p>was ten or twenty-five miles between water- </p><p>holes it was, after all, just guesswork— </p><p>guesswork first on the part of an Indian </p><p>runner, guesswork on his own part; guess- </p><p>work where the penalty for a mistake might </p><p>well be death. No, as he went on, there </p><p>was not much call to puzzle over the ques- </p><p>tion, “Who is Tiyo?” </p><p> “In a race across the desert with the</p><p>‘Skeleton Old Man’ it is well to travel </p><p>light!” Northrup remembered that bit of </p><p>advice. From So Wuhti’s caves he had </p><p>brought water, corn-meal, a little dried </p><p>meat which she informed him was rabbit </p><p>meat but concerning which he had his </p><p>doubt. At any rate it was meat. </p><p> When he came to a pool in a dry creek-</p><p>bed, a spring great enough to give life to a </p><p>little splotch of green stuff under the cliffs, </p><p>he rested, sometimes a day or two if there </p><p>was a hard pull ahead of him. Here he </p><p>found animal life, cotton-tails and jack-rab- </p><p>bits for the most part and a few birds. </p><p>They were tame, having no doubt never set </p><p>their bright round eyes upon a thing which </p><p>walked upright as he did, and they were </p><p>curious. </p><p> What he needed Northrup killed, either</p><p>with his automatic or with stones. The </p><p>meat had but to be tossed over the limb </p><p>of sage or mesquite for the sun to “jerk” it </p><p>for him. </p><p> But times came when his stomach was</p><p>empty and he went long without food; when </p><p>there were no last, precious drops in his </p><p>canteen and he began to fear that at last </p><p>his map was lying to him. But always he </p><p>forged on; never did the thought of turning </p><p>back come to him. He knew that Strang </p><p>had gone ahead, Strang for whom he had </p><p>felt a mild sort of contempt. </p><p> He passed successively the points he had</p><p>marked “Cave Rocks,” where he spent two </p><p>days and a half in interested exploration of </p><p>the broken remnants of a civilization which </p><p>must have been many centuries old before </p><p>the Spaniards came into the New World; </p><p>Big Skeleton, where, as the Hopi had fore- </p><p>told, he came upon the sun-bleached bones</p><p>of what must at one time been a veritable </p><p>giant of a man, now a pile of bones no long- </p><p>er of interest to preying animals where it </p><p>lay upon the top of an overhanging boulder; </p><p>Poison Springs where there were more skele- </p><p>tons, these of thirst-tormented, unwary ani- </p><p>mals; the Sunken Meadows which might </p><p>have been originally the home of all the </p><p>world’s butterflies, and where many re- </p><p>mained, great-winged, incredibly swift, that </p><p>they might live at all through the eternal </p><p>warfare which the bird - folk here waged </p><p>upon them, where humming-birds bright- </p><p>ened the air and mocking-birds shook out </p><p>their cool, clear notes against desert sun </p><p>and silence; into the ancient realm of cliff- </p><p>dwellers where he saw countless orifices </p><p>punctured into the cliffs a hundred, five </p><p>hundred feet above some spring where he </p><p>camped. </p><p> As the weeks wore on and he entered</p><p>more deeply into the heart of the unknown, </p><p>Northrup became possessed of a faith in </p><p>the undertaking which had not been with </p><p>him at the outset. Then he had thought, </p><p>“I’ll go and see.” Now he felt, “I’ll go and </p><p>find!” </p><p> The very fact that every day he had con-</p><p>stant proof of the Hopi’s truthfulness began </p><p>to work its spell upon him. Why should </p><p>the end of the tale then prove fiction? Was </p><p>he hourly drawing nearer the desert trea- </p><p>sure-house? </p><p>ACROSS bare, blistering miles he </p><p>followed his trail that led him to </p><p>those deathless springs which in old </p><p>times had made these arid lands an open </p><p>thoroughfare to moccasined feet. There </p><p>were times in those long, silent days of utter </p><p>solitude when, far to right or left, he fan- </p><p>cied he saw along high cliffs the remains of </p><p>an old civilization, man-made trails in the </p><p>rock, rudely circular holes in the precipices </p><p>which well may have led into cool, cham- </p><p>bered dwellings. </p><p> But it was risking too much to seek to in-</p><p>vestigate here where distances are deceptive </p><p>and water is not assured. Nor did he have </p><p>the inclination to linger. His quest had </p><p>gotten into his blood. </p><p> The time came at last when, standing</p><p>clear and distinct in the north, he saw the</p><p>line of cliffs marking his journey’s end. He </p><p>traveled now at night, since the moon was </p><p>at the full. Through the loose sand which </p><p>seemed one instant to give away as freely </p><p>as water only to grasp at his ankles and </p><p>hold him back the next, he plowed on all </p><p>that night, his face set toward the north </p><p>star. In the moonlight the desert about </p><p>him was touched into a softness of beauty </p><p>which was no attribute of it in the harsh </p><p>light of day; the distant mountains looked </p><p>Yahoya </p><p>13 </p><p>unreal, mystically lovely, the borders of </p><p>fairyland. </p><p> “What sort of people were the men and</p><p>women who lived this, knew no life but </p><p>this?” was Northrup’s thought over and </p><p>over. “The warriors, were they as hard as </p><p>the desert by day? The maidens, were they </p><p>as savage as their lovers? Or did the soft- </p><p>ness of desert moonlight, the tenderness of </p><p>desert colorings seep into their souls?” </p><p> Toward dawn, from a gently sloping</p><p>loma, he saw the clump of trees, mesquite </p><p>for the most part, betokening the spot where </p><p>he was to water and rest. From here, when </p><p>the coolness of another dusk came, he would </p><p>press 011—over the last lap of the quest. </p><p> That day he dozed restlessly, dreaming</p><p>broken dreams from which he started up </p><p>repeatedly, muttering. The scenes through </p><p>which he had so long traveled had had their </p><p>deeper impressions upon him and suggested </p><p>wild thoughts which in sleep were uncheck- </p><p>ed. The speculation of what might lay </p><p>ahead mingled with them. </p><p> He felt all night as if he were in the grip</p><p>of some power other than his own, not to </p><p>be explained by materialistic mankind. He </p><p>dreamed that the old peoples who had </p><p>striven with the desert for existence, who </p><p>had mastered it and lived through it, were </p><p>not dead; that they still had their moun- </p><p>tain fastnesses; that he moved among them; </p><p>that strange adventures were his. </p><p> Toward late afternoon, too restlessly</p><p>eager for further rest, he ate, drank, filled </p><p>his canteens and struck out for the moun- </p><p>tains. And before he had gone a mile, be- </p><p>fore the sun had wheeled down toward the </p><p>end of the hottest day he had yet experi- </p><p>enced, a thing occurred which sent a thrill </p><p>through the man’s physical being, a fresh </p><p>shock of wonderment into his heart. </p><p> Before him were the heat waves trembling</p><p>over a wide expanse of barren sand. Sand </p><p>for miles in each direction, the white, loose </p><p>sand which one finds in wind - tumbled </p><p>dunes, like the white sand of the seashore, </p><p>but waterless. Then slowly into the empti- </p><p>ness of burning air there grew a vision. He</p><p>looked upon it at first with little interest; </p><p>this sort of thing could hardly interest him </p><p>after all these years of life upon the fringe </p><p>of the desert, he thought. But, ten steps </p><p>further he grew stock still, his heart thump- </p><p>ing wildly, the old sense of the supernatural </p><p>strong upon him. </p><p> He saw, woven into the semblance of</p><p>reality from sunlight and air, hanging in the </p><p>air close to the ground, like some master’s </p><p>painting suspended by invisible ropes, a </p><p>scene of rare beauty, of mad beauty, for </p><p>this bleak stretch of scant vegetation. It </p><p>was a garden a hundred feet across, with </p><p>tall, lush, water-loving flowers such as he </p><p>had never seen before. </p><p> In the heart of the garden a pool of water</p><p>with shade-trees dropping leaves into it, a </p><p>pool not of nature’s making but of man’s. </p><p>For surely its basin was white rock which </p><p>man’s hand had carved and scooped out; </p><p>surely there stood carven pillars and col- </p><p>umns of white stone about it. The water </p><p>shone at him with a blue laughter, the white </p><p>of the rock glistened like snow; the grass </p><p>and plants flung emerald reflections at </p><p>themselves; the blossoms everywhere were </p><p>purple and scarlet and deep rose. </p><p> Clearer and clearer grew the desert vision</p><p>until Northrup, seeing a bright-colored par- </p><p>rot drop from a swaying branch like a float- </p><p>ing flower, caught his breath in wonder- </p><p>ment. </p><p> “My God!” cried Northrup sharply.</p><p>“Have I gone mad?” </p><p> He knew the way in which the thirst-</p><p>torment ends: in forgetfulness of what one </p><p>has suffered, in delicious delirium, in fancies </p><p>like this thing which his two eyes told him </p><p>was physical fabric. </p><p> His eyes had followed the gaudy flight of</p><p>the parrot. And so they came to see what </p><p>he had not seen before, to trick him into </p><p>thinking he saw what he would not believe </p><p>existed. </p><p> A hand had been thrown out—never mi-</p><p>rage like this if this in sober truth were not </p><p>magic’s masterpiece—a slow-moving, grace- </p><p>ful hand, a bare arm of rare perfection. The </p><p>parrot had perched upon a finger, seeming</p><p>to cock a suspicious, jealous head toward </p><p>Northrup. So Northrup had seen the hand, </p><p>the arm, the maiden herself. </p><p> She was lying upon her side, an arm flung</p><p>out, an arm under her head. He saw the </p><p>loose hair about her face, saw—or fancied </p><p>he saw, for his senses were reeling—the face </p><p>itself, the lips curving to languid laughter, </p><p>saw the white robe girt about with a broad </p><p>band of blue, saw the crimson flower set </p><p>close to the brown throat, saw the little </p><p>bare feet from which the white moccasins </p><p>had fallen. And then-- </p><p> Then the air had wavered and shimmered</p><p>and clouded and cleared, and Sax Northrup </p><p>14 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>found himself staring out across an empty </p><p>stretch of white sand, drifted here and there </p><p>by the desert winds. </p><p>V </p><p>TONIGHT the wind rose with sun- </p><p>set, sweeping across the desert in </p><p>strong gusts. The white drifts of </p><p>sand were disposed anew, in fresh designs. </p><p>The sand, carried in level strata, cut at </p><p>Northrup’s face and hands, stinging him </p><p>unmercifully like fine particles of heated </p><p>glass. </p><p> Within an hour the wind dropped. The</p><p>sparse grass here and there was motionless. </p><p>It was stifling hot for another hour. Then </p><p>came sudden cold through which Northrup </p><p>made swifter progress. At dawn he thought </p><p>that the mountains were not ten miles away, </p><p>that he could come to them long before </p><p>noon. </p><p> But as the sun rose, the wind came up</p><p>with it, blowing again in mighty gusts, then </p><p>settling into a steady storm from the north. </p><p>Every step of the way now Northrup fought </p><p>hard. The wind whipped the moisture out </p><p>of his body until his skin seemed to be on fire. </p><p> Bend his head as he might, the sand found</p><p>its way under his hat-brim, cutting his face, </p><p>driving through his shirt-collar, slipping </p><p>everywhere into his clothing, running into </p><p>his boots. An hour after sun-up it was fear- </p><p>fully hot; the sun was a small ball looking </p><p>very far away yet smoldering with an in- </p><p>tense red heat. </p><p> He hoarded his water, but again and</p><p>again his dry throat drove him to lift his </p><p>canteen to his lips. He sought to see the </p><p>mountains ahead of him and could not make </p><p>out the dimmest outline. </p><p> The flying sand would have hidden them</p><p>had they been less than a tenth of the ten </p><p>miles distant. It had smothered the world; </p><p>it was choking, stifling him. He tied a </p><p>handkerchief about his face and threw him- </p><p>self to the ground. He could make no prog- </p><p>ress against that fierce, raging storm from </p><p>the north. He knew the folly of matching </p><p>his strength against it. At this rate he</p><p>would have exhausted his force, drunk his </p><p>water in an hour, and then the piling, drift- </p><p>ing, flying sand would work its grim way </p><p>with him. </p><p> He began to think the storm would</p><p>never end. The darkness into which mid- </p><p>day was plunged grew thicker; the sun was </p><p>a terrible, unearthly thing, dim and red. </p><p> Until far in the afternoon the sand-storm</p><p>swept upon him, racing away into the south </p><p>with a sound of distant booming, with the </p><p>whistle of dry sand upon dry wind. Little </p><p>by little it subsided, the air thinned, a vague </p><p>blur looking at the end of the world marked </p><p>the mountains. </p><p> Northrup lifted his canteen. He had only</p><p>a little water, perhaps two cupfuls, left. He </p><p>drank sparingly and, fearful lest the wind </p><p>might rise again, blowing for many days as </p><p>he knew it did at times, he forced his heavy </p><p>way northward. </p><p> He moved like a ghost through a mist of</p><p>sand all that day. The wind came and went </p><p>in gusts, dying down utterly toward sun- </p><p>set. The air cleared then, the mountains rose </p><p>steeper, came marching to meet him. He </p><p>drank the last drop of water and pushed on. </p><p> Moonrise found him, beaten and grimy,</p><p>at the mouth of the great canon toward </p><p>which he had journeyed. He hurried on </p><p>into the canon. There were black shadows </p><p>everywhere about him. But slowly as he </p><p>went on the shadows drew into themselves </p><p>as the moon climbed higher. </p><p> Here, on each side of him, were the walls</p><p>of the canon, lifted up in sheer cliffs. Al- </p><p>ready the cliffs were a hundred feet high; </p><p>ahead he could see that they stood up into </p><p>the sky seven hundred, a thousand feet. </p><p>The canon where he stood was perhaps fifty </p><p>yards in width; a little further on it widen- </p><p>ed out to three times fifty yards, narrowing </p><p>again rapidly. </p><p> But now Northrup’s eyes were concerned</p><p>not with the walls of rock but with the floor </p><p>of the canon. He wanted water, wanted it </p><p>badly. All day he had been stinted for it; </p><p>now he must have it, and soon. His throat </p><p>ached and burned; his tongue felt thick and </p><p>stiff in his mouth; his whole body cried to</p><p>him for water. </p><p> He believed that he had come to the right</p><p>canon; it was as the Hopi had described it, </p><p>lying due north of the last water-hole, with </p><p>the tallest peak towering above it. If in </p><p>the sand-storm he had lost his bearings, why </p><p>then so much the worse for a foolhardy ad- </p><p>venturer. </p><p>FOR an hour he sought water and </p><p>ImuS found none. His thirst was tor- </p><p>menting him, driving him mad. </p><p>The moonlight glistening from a white slab </p><p>of granite tricked him; he hurried stumbling </p><p>Yahoya </p><p>15 </p><p>to it only to twist his lips into a silent curse </p><p>when he saw clearly. </p><p> He sucked at his canteen and in sudden</p><p>wrath threw it from him. A moment of </p><p>terror came upon him in which he ran here </p><p>and there blindly. He jerked himself to- </p><p>gether with anger at himself. </p><p> He went to the flat-topped boulder and</p><p>sat down. He needed rest almost as badly </p><p>as he needed water. And he must get him- </p><p>self in hand. </p><p> The orb of the moon silvered the cliffs</p><p>above him. Northrup sent his eyes quest- </p><p>ing everywhere, even up the cliffs. He saw </p><p>something move, a wolf he supposed. He </p><p>wasn’t interested in wolves; it was water he </p><p>wanted. </p><p> But his eyes remained a moment with</p><p>the sign of life, hundreds of feet above him. </p><p>The moving thing came out from a blotch </p><p>of shadow and stood upon the edge of the </p><p>cliff. It was not a wolf, it was a man, or </p><p>else the trickery of the moon was building </p><p>another taunting vision for him. </p><p> The moving form, coming to the very</p><p>edge, stood still. Northrup saw the man </p><p>distinctly, almost straight up above him. </p><p>The face was in profile, etched clear against </p><p>the sky. It was the face of an Indian, Hopi </p><p>perhaps, but handsomer than the Hopi </p><p>Northrup had known, the nose prominent, </p><p>the features sharply cut and clear. The In- </p><p>dian was naked save for the white loin- </p><p>cloth and the band about his head. His </p><p>arms were flung out toward the moon as if </p><p>in supplication, his body rigid a moment, </p><p>his head lifted. </p><p> Northrup sought to call out, and a dry</p><p>whisper in his tortured throat fell hissingly </p><p>upon his own ears. He sprang up, striving </p><p>again to call. But the form above him was </p><p>gone. The man had drawn back from the </p><p>cliff-edge; the moonlight silvered the rock </p><p>where he had been. </p><p> Hastily Northrup sought the way up</p><p>there, knowing that he must come upon this </p><p>man before he was beyond call. He might </p><p>have used his gun to attract attention—he</p><p>thought of that now—but already his feet </p><p>had found the first of the rude steps in the </p><p>cliff and he was climbing rapidly. When he </p><p>came to the top, then if the man were not </p><p>to be seen he would use the gun. </p><p> As Northrup’s head rose slowly above the</p><p>edge of the cliff he stopped suddenly, a lit- </p><p>tle gasp in his throat. Here was a great </p><p>shelf against the precipice, the cliffs falling </p><p>abruptly to the desert below, rising sheer </p><p>another five hundred feet back of the level </p><p>space. The space, itself some hundred feet </p><p>in length and half of that in width, appeared </p><p>to him like some mighty stage set for one of </p><p>the desert’s wild extravaganzas. </p><p> He saw not one man but fifty, a hundred;</p><p>he could not estimate how many. All were </p><p>like the first, gaunt-bodied, clothed in the </p><p>loin-cloth of pure white, their bodies glis- </p><p>tening in the moonlight like polished bronze. </p><p>They were moving about in a slow, stately </p><p>procession, their arms lifted to the moon, </p><p>their faces upturned, their forms swaying </p><p>rhythmically as they circled about a form </p><p>standing above them upon a flat boulder. </p><p>Along the cliff wall upon the far side of the </p><p>level space Northrup saw other forms, these </p><p>in the shadow, clothed in white robes, </p><p>whether of native cotton or buckskin he </p><p>could not tell, the forms of matrons and </p><p>maidens, scores of them. </p><p> Not a sound had come to him. The feet</p><p>moving in the wide circle were bare feet </p><p>falling lightly upon a floor of rock. He saw </p><p>lips opened, moving in unison as if some </p><p>mighty chant were bursting from them. </p><p>And yet no sound of singing came to him. </p><p>It was as still here as it was out ten miles </p><p>across the sands. </p><p> The form standing upon the boulder</p><p>about which the others circled, was that of </p><p>an old man. Northrup saw the hooked </p><p>beak of a nose like a hawk’s, the hair falling </p><p>about the shoulders, silver under the moon, </p><p>the black eyes filled with a strange ecstasy. </p><p>And then the black eyes saw him. </p><p> Just Northrup’s head coming up slowly</p><p>from the void below', a great head of yel- </p><p>low, disheveled hair, a great yellow beard, </p><p>unkempt and made over into gold by the </p><p>night light, great blue eyes looking fierce as </p><p>a wolf’s from the thirst upon him.</p><p> And yet the ceremonial dance, if such it</p><p>were, went on with no pause. The old man </p><p>stood still, his arms outflung, his lips mov- </p><p>ing as the lips of the others moved. He had </p><p>seen Northrup, he had seemed then to have </p><p>forgotten him. </p><p> Northrup came slowly up to the ledge,</p><p>his big body seeming unnaturally large when </p><p>at last he stood upon a level w'ith the </p><p>others. </p><p> “Water!” he cried hoarsely. “I want</p><p>water.” </p><p> He had spoken in English. His voice cut</p><p>rudely into the silence. Those wrho had </p><p>i6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>not seen him before saw him now. A hun- </p><p>dred looks turned upon him, swift and </p><p>startled. For a moment the swaying bodies </p><p>and moving lips grew as still as the rocks. </p><p>Then again the bodies swayed, the lips </p><p>moved, the silent circle continued as if he </p><p>had not broken into it. </p><p> “Water!” cried Northrup again, moving</p><p>toward them heavily like some great tawny- </p><p>maned lion, wrath in his eyes. And in half </p><p>a dozen tongues, dialects of the southwest </p><p>he hurled the word at them: </p><p> “Water. I want water!”</p><p> A fierce anger surged into Northrup’s</p><p>heart. Would these copper-bodied devils </p><p>of silence keep on with their mad dance </p><p>while Sax Northrup was dying of thirst? </p><p> He bore down upon them, the voice in</p><p>his throat harsh and savage. They gave </p><p>back before him, moving but a little to the </p><p>side, their bodies still swaying, their lips </p><p>still moving. But he saw that the scores of </p><p>eyes were turned upon him wonderingly. </p><p> So he came almost to the boulder upon</p><p>which the old man stood. He saw that </p><p>this one was clad differently from the others, </p><p>a long robe hanging from his shoulders, girt- </p><p>ed about by a broad band of red, a chain of </p><p>glass beads—or were they turquoises?— </p><p>about the forehead, holding the hair back. </p><p>He had come almost to this man, thinking </p><p>him to be the one in authority here, when </p><p>he found another of the bronze bodies in his </p><p>path. </p><p> Northrup plunged toward him, but this</p><p>man did not move aside. He was taller </p><p>than the others, Northrup noted, gaunt- </p><p>bodied like them, but with mighty sinews </p><p>standing out upon shoulders and arms and </p><p>thighs, a man as tall as Northrup. </p><p> Northrup threw out his arm to thrust this</p><p>man aside, his one thought to come to the </p><p>old man. But his arm struck a body hard </p><p>like rock, unyielding. </p><p> “-you!” shouted Northrup. “Stand</p><p>aside. I want water!”</p><p> The man’s body was swaying gently with</p><p>the other swaying bodies, his lips moving </p><p>with the other moving lips, his eyes fear- </p><p>less and stubborn and filled with threat. </p><p>Northrup’s two hands shot out, gripping </p><p>the bare shoulders. </p><p> Until now he had seen no sign of a weapon</p><p>among these people. But suddenly a knife </p><p>had leaped out in this man’s right hand, the </p><p>moonlight running down the thin, keen </p><p>blade. And still no sound save Northrup’s </p><p>heavy breathing and scuffling feet and an- </p><p>gry, snarling voice. </p><p> Northrup’s rage was like the rage of a</p><p>mad desert animal. As the knife-blade </p><p>swept upward, preparatory for the down- </p><p>ward blow, Northrup struck. His big fist </p><p>hammered straight into the Indian’s face, </p><p>the knife clattered to the rocks, the Indian </p><p>staggering back. </p><p> In an instant Northrup was upon him,</p><p>had caught the lean body in his hungering </p><p>hands, had dragged it to the cliff’s edge, had </p><p>lifted it high in air until the bronzed limbs </p><p>stood out against the sky. </p><p> Then, his savage blood-lust gone as swift-</p><p>ly as it had come, he had cast the man </p><p>down upon the ledge at his feet, turning </p><p>swiftly toward the other forms which had </p><p>ceased swaying at last. And as he turned </p><p>he heard a burst of laughter, the soft, tin- </p><p>kling laughter of a woman. Out of silence </p><p>he had drawn this thing, a woman’s laugh </p><p>bubbling over with mirth like the overflow </p><p>of a sparkling fountain. And then he saw </p><p>her. </p><p> Beyond the stone where the old man</p><p>stood was a narrow rift in the wall of rock. </p><p>Deep in the rift was a blazing fire, throwing </p><p>into relief the form which had come out </p><p>from it. The form of a girl, her left arm </p><p>and shoulder bare and brown, a single stone </p><p>or bead gleaming upon her forehead, her </p><p>slender form clad in a long, loose robe of </p><p>white, her feet encased in moccasins of white </p><p>buckskin. </p><p> And her eyes under her dusky hair laugh-</p><p>ed, fcer red lips laughed. And as if an echo </p><p>of her laughter came the laughter of the </p><p>gaudy-plumaged parrot perched upon her</p><p>round wrist. </p><p> Northrup stared at her in amazement,</p><p>thinking himself staring at some soft maid- </p><p>en of the Orient. He forgot the others, for- </p><p>got the man at his feet who had rolled over, </p><p>his dark hand going swiftly to the knife </p><p>upon the rock. He thought of it in time </p><p>because of what he saw in the girl’s eyes. </p><p> No sound after the laughter had died</p><p>away, no single word. But in her eyes was </p><p>a language which was not to be misunder- </p><p>stood. There was anger there now, a wrath </p><p>which blazed as brightly as Northrup’s had. </p><p>And there was a command. Her eyes, pass- </p><p>ing beyond Northrup, were upon the man </p><p>with the knife. </p><p> She lifted her hand as if putting a cup of</p><p>water to her lips. Then she nodded briefly </p><p>Yahoya </p><p>at the man who stood so close to Northrup </p><p>with the knife shaking in his hand. North- </p><p>rup, turning, saw again the picture of an- </p><p>ger there, but an anger sullen and hesi- </p><p>tant. </p><p> He again looked to the girl. Her hand,</p><p>pointing at this man, made again the swift </p><p>gesture of lifted cup, then swept in a wide </p><p>arc, pointing into the rift in the rock walls </p><p>through which the fire gleamed. </p><p> Northrup found himself watching as he</p><p>might have done were this in reality some </p><p>extravaganza and he in his seat in the audi- </p><p>ence. He read the command in the girl’s </p><p>furious eyes, the hesitation and sullen rage </p><p>in the man’s, the wonder in other eyes, and </p><p>something that looked like fear, a look of </p><p>baffled fury in the eyes of the old man in </p><p>the long robe. And then he was following </p><p>the man with the knife, passing through a </p><p>long lane of silent, watchful figures, going </p><p>after his guide through the narrow passage- </p><p>way into the cliffs. </p><p> For an instant, as he was passing close to</p><p>where the girl stood at the mouth of the </p><p>cleft, Northrup paused, his eyes turned curi- </p><p>ously upon her. Her eyes met his steadily, </p><p>eyes whose color was elusive there in the </p><p>moonlight. He could only tell that they </p><p>were big, dark and lustrous. </p><p> A word of thanks upon his lips was check-</p><p>ed by what he read in her quick expression. </p><p>The girl’s gaze had swept him from the top </p><p>of his tousled yellow hair to the sole of his </p><p>dusty boots. Her look, meeting his again, </p><p>was filled with admiration; her thought </p><p>stood out plainly, with no attempt at con- </p><p>cealment. It was as if she had opened her </p><p>red mouth and said softly, wonderingly: </p><p> “You are the biggest man, the most won-</p><p>derful, the most handsome I have ever look- </p><p>ed upon!” </p><p> Northrup’s face reddened suddenly and</p><p>he went on, merely bowing deeply as he </p><p>passed. He saw the face of the man with </p><p>the knife; this man too had read the girl’s </p><p>expression and his features were twisted </p><p>with malicious rage. </p><p>VI </p><p>r NORTHRUP, forcing himself to </p><p>drink slowly, looked about him be- </p><p>tween sips of the cold water. He </p><p>had followed his guide through the narrow </p><p>cleft, by the fagot fire, up a series of wind- </p><p>ing, uneven steps in the rock and out upon </p><p>a second ledge, some distance to the side of </p><p>the first and some fifty feet higher. </p><p> Here, in a niche in the rock, was a clay</p><p>water-jug, brimming. Above rose the cliffs </p><p>precipitately upon one side; upon the other </p><p>they fell straight down to the more gentle </p><p>slope of the foothills. There was-no sign of </p><p>habitation here, nothing to bespeak human </p><p>occupation of these heights save the water- </p><p>jug and the Indian who had brought him </p><p>here. </p><p> Turning, Northrup looked back down the</p><p>rude stairs and through the cut in the rocks. </p><p>Upon the lower ledge the old man was </p><p>standing upon the boulder, his arms lifted, </p><p>his face upturned, his lips moving. About </p><p>him the bronze figures, naked save for the </p><p>loin-cloths, were passing noiselessly, bodies </p><p>swaying rhythmically. </p><p> The girl with the parrot upon her wrist,</p><p>a slender, peeled willow-rod tipped with </p><p>feathers in her hand, was watching them. </p><p>Her Ups moved with the others, her lithe </p><p>body swayed with theirs, the feather-tipped </p><p>rod in her hand beat time to the voiceless </p><p>singing. </p><p> The man at Northrup’s side had slipped</p><p>silently away, his bare feet falling noise- </p><p>lessly upon the rock staircase. Swiftly he </p><p>went down, dropping from sight, reappear- </p><p>ing by the fire, passing out upon the lower </p><p>ledge to take once more his place in the </p><p>circling about the old man. </p><p> Was the desert in all truth a place be-</p><p>witched? And were these voiceless beings </p><p>the band of sorcerers brewing black magic </p><p>to cast out through the moonlight and over </p><p>the world? What strange race of tongue- </p><p>less people was this upon which he had </p><p>stumbled, following the wild tale of a dying </p><p>Indian down in Santa Fe? And—suddenly </p><p>the question which had not presented itself </p><p>for many days came back to him now—who </p><p>was Tiyo? </p><p> Northrup shrugged his shoulders in an-</p><p>swer to his own questioning and again lifted </p><p>the water-jug to his lips, drinking more </p><p>deeply now. Time would answer him and </p><p>in the meantime he was not going to die of </p><p>hunger and thirst. He sat down upon the </p><p>verge of the higher ledge, filled his pipe and, </p><p>resting, watched what went on below. </p><p> For the greater part of an hour the silent</p><p>circling continued. Then, at no signal </p><p>which he could see, it ceased suddenly, </p><p>breaking off with abrupt finality. </p><p> The girl with the parrot, walking slowly</p><p>i8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>between the two long lines of bronze figures </p><p>which had drawn up and grown motionless </p><p>for her passing, went to the boulder where </p><p>the old man in the white robe stood. As </p><p>he reached down she put her hand up, tak- </p><p>ing one of his. She carried it to her lips, </p><p>the action filled with reverence. The old </p><p>man stood above her like one great in power, </p><p>undisputed in authority, accepting homage </p><p>and reverence as his due; the girl’s attitude </p><p>was one of rare humbleness and humility. </p><p> But in an instant the parts had changed.</p><p>As she had dropped the withered hand, the </p><p>old man had slipped down from his place </p><p>of eminence. In a moment he had sunk to </p><p>his knees, had lifted the blue embroidered </p><p>fringe of her robe, had carried it to his lips. </p><p>And the girl’s air had suddenly undergone a </p><p>change lightning swift. Her head was lift- </p><p>ed, the round throat showing brown and </p><p>bare through the opening in her robe; she </p><p>had gathered her small height so that she </p><p>looked tall; her manner was subtly arro- </p><p>gant, queenly proud. As the kneeling fig- </p><p>ure looked up at her the reverence was in </p><p>his eyes, the power and dignity in hers. </p><p> “It’s the land of mad folks!” grunted</p><p>Northrup. </p><p> A man knowing as much as Northrup of</p><p>the Indians of the Southwest, such as dwell </p><p>in Oraibi, Walpi, ancient Taos, throughout </p><p>the desert lands of New Mexico, Arizona, </p><p>Utah, knows with what tenacity they cling </p><p>to traditions which were old centuries be- </p><p>fore the armored Spaniard came hi to the </p><p>New World. He knew them for a deeply </p><p>religious people, their beliefs stoutly main- </p><p>tained in the face of alien interference, filled </p><p>with ceremony and symbolism. He knew </p><p>that this thing which he was watching was </p><p>some rite deeply important to these people, </p><p>and could only watch, wondering vaguely </p><p>what it portended. </p><p> Among savage people there is perhaps</p><p>even less difficulty in selecting at a glance </p><p>the “higher-ups” than among a people who </p><p>have gone further with civilization. Al- </p><p>ready Northrup recognized the very ob- </p><p>vious fact that the persons to be reckoned </p><p>with here were the old man in the white </p><p>robe, a priest, without doubt, the young</p><p>man with the knife, and the girl. And now, </p><p>awakening a keener interest in him, came </p><p>the knowledge that, for the moment at </p><p>least, it was the girl to whom all eyes were </p><p>turned with reverence and obedience. </p><p> She lifted the rod in her hand, a baho, or</p><p>prayer-stick, no doubt, and once more the </p><p>silent circle was described, the old man </p><p>leading, the young fellow with the wonder- </p><p>ful physique following, the others taking </p><p>their places behind him. And all of them, </p><p>passing under the outstretched baho, stoop- </p><p>ed swiftly to lift the hem of her garment to </p><p>their lips. She looked over their bent heads </p><p>with bright eyes, like a young queen just </p><p>come into her birthright. </p><p> In a little they had all passed by her and</p><p>in silent procession had come through the </p><p>defile in the rocks, mounting the crooked </p><p>steps, passing by Northrup with sharp, </p><p>black eyes turned upon him, across the sec- </p><p>ond ledge and down at the far side, seeming </p><p>to him to drop one by one into the void be- </p><p>low. </p><p> After them came the women, matrons</p><p>first, with their hair arranged in Hopi fash- </p><p>ion, done low at each side, the maidens with </p><p>their hair massed into two great whorls, </p><p>one at each ear, flashing quick glances of </p><p>curiosity at him. Upon the lower ledge </p><p>now were five figures only, the girl with the </p><p>parrot and the two maidens who stood a </p><p>little back of her, one on each side, the old </p><p>man and the man with whom Northrup </p><p>had struggled. </p><p> Now the girl was making swift gestures</p><p>which for a little perplexed the man who </p><p>watched her from above, though her com- </p><p>panions seemed readily enough to grasp her </p><p>meaning. Across the few feet which separ- </p><p>ated them, Northrup could catch their ex- </p><p>pressions as clearly as if it had been the sun </p><p>instead of the round moon hanging above </p><p>them. Into the eyes of the old man and </p><p>the two attendant maidens came a quick </p><p>look of horror; into the eyes of the other </p><p>man a look of black anger. </p><p> The girl, seeing what Northrup saw, lift-</p><p>ed her head a little higher, her eyes grown </p><p>brighter, suddenly hard as rock. The ges- </p><p>ture again and Northrup knew that it had </p><p>something to do with him. For the feather-</p><p>tipped willow-rod was pointed toward him, </p><p>then out across the ledge where the others </p><p>had gone, then to the young man before her. </p><p> The old man seemed upon the verge of</p><p>speaking. But, still with locked lips, he </p><p>shook his head vigorously. The girl whirl- </p><p>ed upon him, her attitude filled with sover- </p><p>eign menace, and he drew back swiftly as if </p><p>afraid of her. The two maidens, eyes wide, </p><p>lips parted breathlessly, stared in sheer </p><p>amazement at her. </p><p>Yahoya </p><p>19 </p><p> Again the girl with the parrot had whirled</p><p>about, her back upon the old man, some- </p><p>thing of contempt in the action, her eyes </p><p>blazing at the younger man. The gesture </p><p>came swift and imperious. The fellow who </p><p>had already felt Northrup’s fist, and whose </p><p>lips were swollen because he had, grew sul- </p><p>len, shaking his head with determined re- </p><p>fusal. </p><p> The girl took a swift step toward him;</p><p>he held his ground obstinately. Suddenly, </p><p>her face showing the fury upon her, she had </p><p>lifted the prayer-stick as if she would strike </p><p>him with it. The thing was a slender rod </p><p>which a man might break between thumb </p><p>and forefinger. And yet it was the sacred </p><p>bahol </p><p> Northrup thought that he heard a gasp;</p><p>he knew that what looked like shaking fear </p><p>had descended from the rod still held aloft. </p><p>The old man and the young had stooped, </p><p>lifting the hem of her garment, and the girl, </p><p>her lips curved into a victor’s smile, turned </p><p>her back upon all of them and came through </p><p>the defile, to the higher ledge and to North- </p><p>rup’s side. She flashed him a smile which, </p><p>filled with triumph, was not without the </p><p>warmth of the admiration which had been </p><p>in her eyes when he had passed her. Then </p><p>she went across the ledge, pausing at the </p><p>brink to look back. </p><p> The old man and the two maidens had</p><p>followed her. The other man, his face con- </p><p>vulsed, his eyes like knives, came to where </p><p>Northrup was now standing. For a mo- </p><p>ment, the two men looking into each other’s </p><p>eyes, had a glimpse of what might lie in the </p><p>future. Then again Northrup was follow- </p><p>ing his guide. </p><p> The girl, seeming satisfied, went down</p><p>over the edge of the cliff. Northrup, follow- </p><p>ing his guide, found other steps there, wind- </p><p>ing downward and turning about a great </p><p>knob of rock. And then, startled by that </p><p>which he might have expected, he was look- </p><p>ing down into the garden with the white </p><p>rock basin, the white stone columns, the </p><p>pool of water and the green-leafed trees he </p><p>had seen in the mirage. </p><p> Here was a third broad ledge, the cliffs</p><p>at the back curving outward over it, al- </p><p>most like a roof. Close under this over- </p><p>hanging precipice was a building, rudely </p><p>square, built of white stone and cement </p><p>with one wide door set between two pillars </p><p>of stone. </p><p> There were half a dozen square openings</p><p>in the wall, their use as windows obvious. </p><p>Upon the flat roof were green things grow- </p><p>ing and the great blossoms looking either </p><p>white or black in the fainter light there. A </p><p>temple, Northrup guessed. He was to learn </p><p>differently soon. </p><p> At the side of the pool the girl with the</p><p>parrot had stopped. The bird, fluttering </p><p>from her wrist, perched upon a limb which </p><p>bent and swayed with him. The old man </p><p>and the younger one, who had guided </p><p>Northrup here, made again the deep obei- </p><p>sance and passed on, going to the far edge </p><p>of this ledge and passing down other steps, </p><p>out of sight. The two attendant maidens, </p><p>their eyes still wide with surprise and won- </p><p>der, waited a few steps from their mistress. </p><p> Again a quick imperious gesture as she</p><p>turned upon them. They moved back and </p><p>away, going from her to the stone building, </p><p>disappearing through the wide door. The </p><p>girl who had remained turned slowly, her </p><p>eyes upon Northrup. </p><p> For a little she stood looking at him with</p><p>deep soberness, her oval face like a little </p><p>child’s in its unaffected interest and curios- </p><p>ity. Then suddenly—it seemed that she </p><p>did all things with rare swiftness excepting </p><p>when the mood or pose of languor was upon </p><p>her—a smile touched her lips into gentle </p><p>curves, her face dimpled up at him, from </p><p>low in her throat came a little burst of </p><p>laughter. </p><p> “Ishohil In your big hands did Tiyo</p><p>look a little bug squirming! For that, Ba- </p><p>hana, I thank you! Askwalil” </p><p> “Tiyo?” grunted Northrup. “So the</p><p>gentleman with the carving-knife is our old </p><p>friend Tiyo, eh?” </p><p> The words, coming with the little start</p><p>of surprise, found utterance quite natural- </p><p>ly in English. In the same tongue he added, </p><p>“You pretty thing! I wonder if you</p><p>know you are the prettiest girl I ever saw, </p><p>red, black, yellow or white?” </p><p> She looked at him frankly puzzled, shak-</p><p>ing her head slowly. Northrup laughed. </p><p>Speaking in the tongue his many months </p><p>with So Wuhti had perfected he said </p><p>quickly: </p><p> “I was just mentioning my delight at</p><p>meeting up with Tiyo. I have heard of </p><p>him.” </p><p> She showed her pleasure at his speaking</p><p>words which she could understand by clap- </p><p>ping her hands. But, again very sober in </p><p>her regard of him, lifting her face upward </p><p>20 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>until the wonder was he didn’t kiss her </p><p>tempting mouth then and there, she studied </p><p>him a moment and then declared as though </p><p>quite satisfied and convinced: </p><p> “You are beautiful, Bahana! You are</p><p>like Sikangvvunuptu! Your eyes are like </p><p>the skies one sees from the mountain-tops. </p><p>Your hair is like gold, more beautiful than </p><p>gold.” </p><p> She came closer, putting up her hand in</p><p>that swift way of hers until her fingers gent- </p><p>ly brushed the hair at his temple. </p><p> “Yes, you are like the God of the Yellow</p><p>Dawn.” </p><p> Northrup whistled. And then, though</p><p>he felt like a fool for it, he blushed. He </p><p>felt his face getting red, as red as fire. The </p><p>girl, seeing his embarrassment, laughed </p><p>again, her mirth rippling out through the </p><p>still night, as pure and clean a thing as the </p><p>moonlight itself. </p><p> “You little devil!” muttered the man.</p><p> She lifted her brows, making again the</p><p>sign that she did not understand. Then for </p><p>an instant Northrup lost sight of her in a </p><p>new vision which appeared abruptly. He </p><p>had thought that Tiyo and the old priest </p><p>had gone on down the rocks somewhere; </p><p>evidently they had contented themselves by </p><p>merely going down over the edge and re- </p><p>maining there just out of sight. </p><p> For, as if some one had pulled a string</p><p>and they both were puppets answering to </p><p>the jerk, their two heads appeared again, </p><p>the old man’s face twisted evilly into a crim- </p><p>son rage, Tiyo’s eyes filled with horror and </p><p>an anger like the priest’s. Even the two </p><p>maidens who had disappeared through the </p><p>wide doorway were back at the entrance; it </p><p>seemed to Northrup that their dark faces </p><p>had grown ashy. He was positive that </p><p>they had clutched at each other and that </p><p>they were trembling. He turned question- </p><p>ing eyes back to the girl. </p><p> If before she had taken upon herself a</p><p>seeming of queenliness, now she was like </p><p>an angry goddess. A moment ago one</p><p>could not have looked into the limpid, </p><p>laughing pools which were her eyes and </p><p>have imagined that they could change so. </p><p>They blazed with an anger which was great- </p><p>er than Tiyo’s and the priest’s; they shone </p><p>with a menace which was hard enough to </p><p>inspire one with terror. Northrup saw that </p><p>while the two men held their places there </p><p>came quickly into their look a certain hint </p><p>of uneasiness; the two maidens had fled </p><p>into the dark interior of the stone building. </p><p> “Why do you linger, Inaa Wuhtaka</p><p>(Father Old Man)?” she said with a tone </p><p>which knew the way to be at once cool, </p><p>steady and deadly. “Why, Tiyo, do you </p><p>bring back into the presence of Yahoya </p><p>your evil face, unbidden? Do you wish </p><p>Yahoya’s blessing? Or her curse perhaps?” </p><p>The baho in her hand lifted a little, a </p><p>very, very little. But the gesture was sig- </p><p>nificant. Both men started back as if they </p><p>had been struck across the faces. Then, </p><p>only anger again to be read in the priest’s </p><p>countenance, he began a series of frantic </p><p>signs which Northrup, looking on in won- </p><p>derment, was at loss to read, but which the </p><p>girl seemed to grasp readily. </p><p> “Inaa,” she said gently, quite as a moth-</p><p>er might speak to a forward child, although </p><p>his years must have numbered seventy at </p><p>the least, while the maiden was at the first </p><p>blush of womanhood. “I understand what </p><p>your locked lips whisper. Your speech </p><p>comes from your heart and so it is kind. </p><p>But you will remember, Inaa, that though </p><p>a priest you are only a man whose path goes </p><p>the way soon of the Skeleton House. And </p><p>you will not forget, Inaa, who is Yahoya! </p><p>Go! Tiyo goes with you.” </p><p> The thin old hands lifted in protest drop-</p><p>ped hopelessly; with no word Inaa, and </p><p>Tiyo with him, went over the cliffs and out </p><p>of sight. Northrup, filled more than ever </p><p>with curiosity, turned to the girl. </p><p> “He is like an old sheep, is Inaa,” she</p><p>smiled with pleasant disrespect for the </p><p>cloth. “All white wool and little brain. </p><p>And Tiyo—Tiyo is his son.” </p><p> “And you,” said Northrup, wondering at</p><p>all he had seen. “You are—Yahoya, a </p><p>great lady—a princess?” </p><p> Her smile was as serene as the moonbeam</p><p>across the still pool as she answered him, </p><p>stating quite simply as the most matter-of- </p><p>fact thing in the world: </p><p> “I am Yahoya—a goddess!”</p><p>VII </p><p>“I — I see,” stammered Northrup </p><p>when he could think of anything to </p><p>say. “I—I might have known it. I </p><p>never saw a goddess before, but—oh, yes, </p><p>you’re a goddess, all right!” </p><p> “Yes,” said Yahoya simply, dimpling at</p><p>him quite like a maiden of flesh and blood, </p><p>altogether adorable. “I am Yahoya, chief </p><p>Y ahoya </p><p>21 </p><p>goddess of the ‘People of the Hidden </p><p>Spring,’ sister of Haruing Wuhti, daughter </p><p>of Cotukvnangi, god of thunder, mother of </p><p>T-okila, the Night, bride of Pookhonghoya, </p><p>god of war.” </p><p> Northrup bowed and remembered to take</p><p>off his hat. From the comer of his eye he </p><p>looked at the goddess Yahoya in stupefac- </p><p>tion. Was she poking fun at him or did </p><p>she believe all of that stuff? </p><p> The question need not go begging for an</p><p>answer. Her whole being breathed the cer- </p><p>tainty that she was what she had said she </p><p>was. The attitude of Inaa the priest and </p><p>his evil-eyed son Tiyo backed up her belief. </p><p>They were all so certain of the thing that </p><p>Northrup, a little dazed, asked himself: </p><p>“Well, why not? Everything happens </p><p>here! Why not find oneself in the presence </p><p>of deity?” </p><p> And he admitted that she looked the part</p><p>•—all except being the mother of Tokila, the </p><p>Night, or of anything else. </p><p> “It is the Festival of Silence,” the god-</p><p>dess was explaining to him in the same </p><p>quiet way. “At such time it is death to </p><p>make so much as a little sound with the </p><p>lips, death to a mortal. But I, being an </p><p>immortal, may do as I please. You, being </p><p>bidden by me, may speak. Inaa,” and she </p><p>laughed again, mirthfully as at a rare </p><p>thought, “Inaa is afraid of the Skeleton Old </p><p>Man. But most of all is he afraid of me!” </p><p>“Yes,” said Northrup, gathering his wits. </p><p>“Exactly.” </p><p> She turned a little and led the way close</p><p>to the pool of water in the white basin, </p><p>along its side and to what appeared to be </p><p>a huge panther-skin cast upon the ground </p><p>under a drooping tree. Here she seated </p><p>herself, stretching out, making herself com- </p><p>fortable, lying as he knew she had been ly- </p><p>ing when the sorcery of the atmosphere had </p><p>shown her to him across the desert. Even </p><p>the parrot was upon a swaying branch </p><p>above her. </p><p> “Be seated, Bahana,” she said lightly.</p><p>“We shall talk. My lips are tired with the </p><p>long silence.”</p><p> Northrup’s tired body was not averse to</p><p>accepting the invitation. He sat just at </p><p>the fringe of the shadow of the tree, a few </p><p>steps from her, where he could see the play </p><p>of her features. And already he began to </p><p>forget his weariness. </p><p> “Yesterday, in the late afternoon,” he</p><p>said with the impulse upon him, “you were </p><p>lying here, upon the panther-skin. Your </p><p>hair was loose, all about your shoulders; </p><p>your little moccasins had fallen off and you </p><p>did not notice. You wore a flower at your </p><p>throat. Your bird was in the tree there. </p><p>He dropped down and perched upon your </p><p>wrist.” </p><p> Yahoya, without sitting up, looked at</p><p>him, a little startled, hers now the time for </p><p>wonderment. </p><p> “But you were not here to see, Bahana.”</p><p>“I was out yonder,” he answered. </p><p>“ ’Way out on the desert.” </p><p> “Then,” she cried a little breathlessly,</p><p>“you too are a god! Not a Bahana but a </p><p>deity. You are perhaps, him I said you </p><p>looked to be, Sikangwunuptu, God of the </p><p>Yellow Dawn! Ishohil” </p><p> She had twisted over, her graceful body</p><p>little less pantherine in its movements than </p><p>had been the body upon whose skin she </p><p>now lay, and slipped to her feet, standing </p><p>over him. </p><p> Wondering what thing she was going to</p><p>do next, Northrup sat still watching her. </p><p>She was making him a curtsey or an obei- </p><p>sance, he wasn’t quite sure which. Any- </p><p>way it was pretty and decidedly worth </p><p>watching. He was already asking himself </p><p>why white girls didn’t have half the charm </p><p>of this wild thing. </p><p> “You are Sikangwunuptu!” she was cry-</p><p>ing softly. “You, a great god of the under- </p><p>world, have come up to visit at the kiva of </p><p>Yahoya, Chief Goddess of the People of </p><p>the Hidden Spring! You are more beauti- </p><p>ful than a man because you are more than </p><p>a man. You have the strength of ten Tiyos </p><p>because you are an immortal. See. I, too, </p><p>am immortal,I, the Goddess Yahoya! And </p><p>yet I, even I, kneel before Sikangwunuptu,</p><p>great God of the Yellow Dawn!” </p><p> And, true enough, the impetuous creature</p><p>had sunk to her knees, throwing out her </p><p>round, brown arms as in supplication. The </p><p>parrot, perhaps bewildered at seeing his </p><p>mistress act so, gave utterance to a nervous </p><p>squawk, fluttered over her head, availed </p><p>himself of a vicious snap at Northrup and </p><p>went back to his tree to watch. </p><p> Northrup in his wanderings up and down</p><p>the world had seen little of womankind, </p><p>knew little of her and her ways. In all es- </p><p>sentials he sat spellbound for an instant, </p><p>hardly grasping Yahoya’s intent. But in </p><p>another second when her two hands had </p><p>found his two and were lifting them to her </p><p>22 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>lips he realized that, savage or goddess, she </p><p>was getting into the way of making him </p><p>blush and that he didn’t like it. </p><p> “Look here,” he said quickly. “My</p><p>name’s Sax Northrup, if you want it. And </p><p>I’m hungry.” </p><p> Yahoya laughed lightly. Northrup</p><p>wasn’t sure that he knew what inspired her </p><p>laughter. She seemed to be built of mirth. </p><p>She was on her feet again in a flash, drop- </p><p>ping him another of her quaint little bows, </p><p>her dark eyes dancing. Then she had cup- </p><p>ped her two hands to her mouth and called. </p><p>Her two maidens came pattering in bare </p><p>feet across the stone courtyard. </p><p> “Nayangap Mana! Tocha Mana!” she</p><p>cried softly to them when, hesitant and </p><p>wide-eyed, they stood before their mistress, </p><p>darting swift, curious glances at Northrup. </p><p>“You are in the presence of the gods!” </p><p> As if this were a signal and they grasped</p><p>it instantly, the two not uncomely maidens </p><p>plumped down upon their knees. </p><p> “Listen!” went on Yahoya swiftly. “He</p><p>whom you see before you is one come up </p><p>from the underworld to have speech with </p><p>Yahoya. Guard your eyes that they go </p><p>not blind with looking upon him. It is </p><p>Sikangwunuptu!” </p><p> Instantly four brown hands flew up to</p><p>hide four very bright and inquisitive eyes. </p><p>Northrup fancied, while he was not certain, </p><p>that the girl called Nayangap was peeking </p><p>at him through her fingers. </p><p> “He has come running across the desert,”</p><p>continued Yahoya. “Therefore is he hun- </p><p>gry. He does not carry water with him as </p><p>men do; therefore he thirsts. Hasten!” </p><p>Before Northrup, missing the canteen </p><p>which had been with him so long, came to </p><p>remember how in a fit of anger he had </p><p>thrown it away down in the canon, Nayan- </p><p>gap and Tocha had flitted back across the </p><p>moonlit space like nimble little ghosts. </p><p> “What makes you so certain,” demanded</p><p>Northrup abruptly, “that you are a god- </p><p>dess?”</p><p> Yahoya, again making herself comfort-</p><p>able upon her panther rug, pondered the </p><p>matter a moment. </p><p> “One just knows,” she explained. “The</p><p>coyote knows he is not a humming-bird </p><p>and the horn toad knows he is not an </p><p>eagle.” </p><p> “How does it happen then that you dwell</p><p>with mere mortals?” </p><p> “I tarry with them but a little while,”</p><p>she told him thoughtfully, her eyes upon </p><p>the moon now. “My home is yonder.” </p><p> “In the moon, I suppose?” he bantered.</p><p> “Yes,” she answered seriously.</p><p> “But,” he argued, scarcely knowing why,</p><p>“you were born here, among these people, </p><p>of them.” </p><p> “Oh, no!” she smiled brightly, shaking</p><p>her head at him. “I was not born. I have </p><p>lived always. I just came.” </p><p> “Then,” he demanded, “how in the—</p><p>how did you get here?” </p><p> “It was a night like this one, many years</p><p>ago,” she explained. “The moon was big, </p><p>like you see it now. I floated down through </p><p>the night.” She laughed reminiscently. </p><p>“When I appeared coming out of nothing- </p><p>ness, singing the sacred song before Inaa, </p><p>the old priest, I think he was much afraid. </p><p>But he knew that a goddess had come.” </p><p>There could be no doubt that she believed </p><p>this rigmarole. Nor did she' seem to be </p><p>insane. If one were taken when she was a </p><p>little girl, taught from the beginning that </p><p>she was an immortal, she’d grow up into </p><p>such a young woman as Yahoya was. In </p><p>the old days when the divine right of kings </p><p>was undisputed the princesses must have </p><p>been no little like the Yahoya type. But </p><p>they were only mortals! </p><p> “And of course Inaa told everybody that</p><p>a goddess had come to town?” </p><p> She nodded, seeing no sacrilege in North-</p><p>rup’s way of speaking. Seeking beyond the </p><p>mystification of her “explanation” he </p><p>thought that he saw light. Priesthood often</p><p>enough is synonymous with trickery; no </p><p>doubt, some years ago old Inaa had needed </p><p>or wanted to strengthen his prestige. It </p><p>had been, no doubt, a comparatively simple </p><p>thing for him to procure a pretty little girl </p><p>from some distant tribe, to bring her here </p><p>secretly and pass her off upon his credulous </p><p>people as a divinity. It was not difficult to </p><p>see how he’d strengthen his own hand in </p><p>the matter. It at once amused Northrup </p><p>and appealed to him as strangely pathetic </p><p>that the girl herself had come to believe as </p><p>the others believed. </p><p> “I suppose,” he said, completing in words</p><p>the thought which had suggested itself to </p><p>him, “that in due course of time Inaa will </p><p>marry you off to Tiyo, his son?” </p><p> “That has been his wish,” she responded.</p><p>“And it was mine, for in holy matters Inaa </p><p>is very wise, while in other things he is stu- </p><p>pid. But when the Man of Wisdom came, </p><p>Yahoya </p><p>23 </p><p>I saw it was not for me to marry Tiyo, but </p><p>him.” </p><p> “And who is the Man of Wisdom?”</p><p> “Oh, he is the one who teaches my peo-</p><p>ple wonderful things! Such things as men </p><p>know out in the world of the white man. </p><p>And he tells Yahoya wonderful tales of the </p><p>land where he will take her one day when </p><p>she marries him—of great wagons which </p><p>run uphill without horses; of wires over </p><p>which people speak across many miles; of </p><p>big waters with houses floating upon them; </p><p>of beautiful women who wear beautiful gar- </p><p>ments.” </p><p> Northrup started, a suspicion that at the</p><p>jump was almost a certainty upon him. </p><p> “A tall man, thin faced, with drooping</p><p>eyes?” he asked. “Very heavy eyebrows, </p><p>coming together over his nose? A way of </p><p>twisting his hands while he listened? He </p><p>has been with you about half a year?” </p><p>Yahoya gazed at him in rapt admira- </p><p>tion. </p><p> “You know everything, Yellow Beard!”</p><p>“I know Strang,” he grunted. “And I </p><p>think I know his ways. So he is going to </p><p>marry you, is he?” </p><p> “Oh, yes,” she dimpled at him. “That</p><p>will be nice, won’t it? He is not pretty like </p><p>you, Yellow Beard, but then he is prettier </p><p>than Tiyo. And he is white.” </p><p> “On the outside,” growled Northrup.</p><p>“But do you think it is wise for an-” </p><p> He had started to say “an Indian girl,”</p><p>and thought better of it. He must try to </p><p>keep in mind that she was a goddess! So </p><p>he finished— </p><p> “For one of your race to marry a white</p><p>man?” </p><p> She stared at him wonderingly a moment,</p><p>then broke again into laughter. </p><p> “So then Yellow Beard does not know</p><p>everything after all! His eyes can not see</p><p>through a piece of cotton cloth. He thought </p><p>that Yahoya was black like Nayangap and </p><p>Tocha. Look!” </p><p>THE amazing maiden had suddenly </p><p>drawn open a little her robe at the </p><p>throat, showing him the merest hint </p><p>of her round breast. And Northrup sat </p><p>astounded. The sun and desert air had </p><p>worked their will with her flower-like face </p><p>and hands and arms, making them brown </p><p>and dusky. But her breast was as white </p><p>as milk! </p><p> “You see,” she smiled quite naturally,</p><p>“goddesses are white like the women of the </p><p>Bahana.” </p><p> “My God!” said Northrup. And then,</p><p>trying to speak sternly although his voice </p><p>was a trifle uncertain, “Cover yourself, </p><p>child. You oughtn’t to do things like that.” </p><p>“Why?” she wanted to know. “Am I </p><p>not pretty?” </p><p> “You are a madness-making little beauty,</p><p>that’s what you are,” he said in English. </p><p>“And besides you are an ingenuous little </p><p>savage.” </p><p> His anger against Strang had had many</p><p>months in which to cool and it was no hard </p><p>matter for Northrup’s generous nature to </p><p>make allowances. But suddenly the old </p><p>anger was flaring out hotter than ever. It </p><p>was no hard matter to see the situation </p><p>through Strang’s eyes. His big hands shut </p><p>slowly into hard fists. </p><p> “Do you love this man, this strange Ba-</p><p>hana?” he asked her. </p><p> Yahoya’s smiling lips had turned into a</p><p>pout. Her quick fingers were busy gather- </p><p>ing her gown close up about her brown </p><p>throat. She had expected him to be pleased </p><p>with her, and he had seemed angry. With a </p><p>quick glance Northrup saw what she was </p><p>doing, glimpsed also a little gold chain </p><p>about her throat, hidden in a moment by </p><p>her cotton garment. </p><p> “Goddesses do not love mere men,” she</p><p>told him loftily. </p><p> Nayangap and Tocha came then bearing</p><p>in their hands broad trays upon which were</p><p>many dishes and enough food for ten men. </p><p>Evidently they expected that the god Si- </p><p>kangwunuptu had a stomach in proportion </p><p>to his might and dignity. They set down </p><p>the trays, half afraid of him and yet thrill- </p><p>ing a little with the thought of being so </p><p>close to him. Then, at a curt nod from </p><p>their mistress, they were gone. </p><p> “Tell me about Strang,” Northrup com-</p><p>manded after a sip of water and beginning </p><p>upon the piki. “Does he love you?” </p><p> “Oh, yes,” Yahoya answered a little stiff-</p><p>ly. “All men love me.” </p><p> “Humph! I don’t.”</p><p> “You!” widening her eyes at him after a</p><p>fashion peculiarly her own. “But you are </p><p>not a man—you’re just a god!” </p><p> “I’m no such thing,” he said emphatic-</p><p>ally. “I’m a man, a white man, I hope, </p><p>and my name is Sax Northrup.” </p><p> “Then,” she informed him demurely, “it</p><p>may chance that after all I shall not marry </p><p>24 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the Man of -Wisdom. For, though you </p><p>growl like a bear, you are so much prettier!” </p><p>“I want to know all about Strang,” said </p><p>Northrup hurriedly. “He’s been here over </p><p>half a year. Why does he stay on so long?” </p><p>She knew perfectly well how to droop her </p><p>eyelids, how to flash a sidelong glance at </p><p>him, how to do whatever she pleased with </p><p>her two dimples. </p><p> “It may be that he has stayed because</p><p>Yahoya lingers here.” </p><p> He wasn’t persuaded. It might be, but</p><p>it didn’t sound like Strang a little bit. It </p><p>was more Strang’s way to get out of this </p><p>with both hands filled and to a place where </p><p>a man might throw his money after the </p><p>sort of things which are to be found in cities </p><p>of the white men. </p><p> “Also,” Yahoya admitted, “it was the</p><p>word of Inaa that the Bahana should not </p><p>go forth to tell of the People of the Hidden </p><p>Spring. He does not go out of sight of </p><p>Tiyo or one of Tiyo’s men.” </p><p> “He is a prisoner then?”</p><p> “He is held in high respect; songs are</p><p>sung for him; my people learn many things </p><p>from him. But it is death for him if he </p><p>tries to go away.” </p><p> “Then,” he asked her, “how does it hap-</p><p>pen that you count on having him show </p><p>you the wonderful things of his world when </p><p>you are married?” </p><p> “You ask many questions, Sax North-</p><p>rup.” She hesitated over the name, casting </p><p>the two words into one and making quite a </p><p>mess of it. “But if you must know, Yahoya </p><p>and Eddie have many words in private.” </p><p>“Eddie!” </p><p> “He tells me to call him that. It is</p><p>nicer than Strang, and oh, so much nicer </p><p>than Saxnorthrup!” She achieved the last </p><p>with a little shudder and another of her sly </p><p>glances at him. “If I decide to love you I </p><p>shall call you Eddie!” </p><p> Northrup passed from corn-meal soup to</p><p>melon, from melon back to corn-meal soup</p><p>without ever realizing that his manner of </p><p>eating was fascinating Yahoya. If Strang </p><p>had been here all this time and had had </p><p>words in private with this unsophisticated </p><p>little thing, if in all that time he had not </p><p>taken the trouble to enlighten her upon her </p><p>possible past history, what was the answer? </p><p> The man who would leave a partner to</p><p>die alone out in the desert, robbing him of </p><p>his last drop of water, was not the man to </p><p>be overscrupulous in his dealings with a </p><p>maid. Not with a maid like Yahoya. </p><p>Northrup looked at her sharply, seeking </p><p>the measure of her beauty. She looked a </p><p>being created all of soft curves, with ten- </p><p>der dimples set just where they would do </p><p>the most good, or the most harm, as the </p><p>case might be. </p><p> “Where is Strang now? Tonight?” he</p><p>asked. </p><p>“There is sickness in the tribe down by </p><p>the corn meadows. Eddie has gone there to </p><p>drive out the sickness and make people well.” </p><p>“Whew! So he’s turned doctor, has he?” </p><p>“He is the Man of Wisdom. He can do </p><p>all things. He knows everything.” </p><p> “He’s certainly got a strangle-hold on</p><p>the situation,” thought Northrup. </p><p> Out of a spell of moody abstraction he</p><p>was recalled to himself by the tinkle of Ya- </p><p>hoya’s laughter. </p><p> “You make faces, like this,” she informed</p><p>him, wrinkling her forehead into a frown </p><p>and thrusting her lower jaw out at him. “It </p><p>must be that you and Eddie are not good </p><p>friends?” </p><p> “I don’t think that we are. But look</p><p>here, Yahoya, have you made up your mind </p><p>that you are going to marry him?” </p><p> “Oh, yes! At the end of the Festival of</p><p>Silence.” </p><p> “What does Inaa say of it? And Tiyo?”</p><p>“Inaa grows very cross. And Tiyo looks </p><p>at Eddie like he could eat him up. Tiyo is </p><p>very sad that I don’t wish to be his wife.” </p><p>“You told me that before. Now the next </p><p>question is, when does the Festival of Si- </p><p>lence end?”</p><p> “With the moonset. Then I will sing the</p><p>sacred song and after that my people may </p><p>unlock their lips.” </p><p> “And you marry Strang at dawn?”</p><p> “Yes, Saxnorthrup.”</p><p> She looked at him teasingly, as if her in-</p><p>stinct or intuition had told her that the </p><p>matter displeased him and as if it were all </p><p>a lark for her. But she looked a little </p><p>troubled when he said shortly: </p><p> “You’re going to do nothing of the sort.</p><p>Not after I have a talk with your friend </p><p>Eddie.” </p><p>VIII </p><p>YAHOYA sat very still, half in </p><p>moonlight, half in shadow, looking </p><p>steadily at Northrup. He, return- </p><p>ing her gaze, could see that in the depths of </p><p>her eyes there was a light as of an inner fire. </p><p>Yahoya </p><p>25 </p><p> “I wonder,” she said softly, “are you Si-</p><p>kangwunuptu, God of the Yellow Dawn? </p><p>Or are you a mere man, Saxnorthrup?” </p><p> It was not a question asked of him but</p><p>of herself and he made no answer. He had </p><p>told her already; now she was seeking to </p><p>decide for herself. Suddenly, with that </p><p>swift gracefulness which was almost like a </p><p>liquid flowing, she was upon her feet, her </p><p>arms thrown out toward him as he rose </p><p>with her. </p><p> “What are you?” she cried, and there</p><p>was passionate earnestness throbbing </p><p>through her erect body, thrilling through </p><p>her clear voice. “You come up like a god </p><p>—a White God of the underworld! Your </p><p>hair is like fine threads of gold; your eyes </p><p>are like such turquoises as they do not find </p><p>any more in the world, such turquoises as </p><p>Haruing Wuhti wears upon her throat and </p><p>arms when the Sun God conies to see how </p><p>beautiful she is. Your skin where the sun </p><p>has not blackened it is white like goat’s </p><p>milk, white and soft like Yahoya’s own! </p><p>Why do you come?” </p><p> She broke off suddenly. He could hear</p><p>her breathing. Then, before he could an- </p><p>swer, she had gone on impetuously, drop- </p><p>ping her arms, moving a little closer to him. </p><p> “Do you come seeking a maiden, Yellow</p><p>Beard? Ishohil There is no mana here so </p><p>beautiful as I! Look! Do you come to </p><p>make my heart leap out of my side for you? </p><p>It has leaped, quick, without waiting, as </p><p>the white antelope leaps up when he sees </p><p>the wolf. If you come seeking a maiden </p><p>then, Yellow Beard, here am I, Yahoya, </p><p>maiden and goddess, who will follow you </p><p>into the desert if you will, or down into the </p><p>underworld.” </p><p> She stood so close to him now that it was</p><p>almost as if he had obeyed the wild im- </p><p>pulse upon him and was holding her in his </p><p>arms. For an instant he felt that one must </p><p>be more than man or less than man not to </p><p>yield to her. </p><p> But his arms, lifting a little, fell again to</p><p>his sides. He had one code, had Sax North- </p><p>rup, and many hard years of seeking to live</p><p>up to it had made him the man he was. </p><p>“Accept the chances which the game of life </p><p>presents, but play the game square!” If </p><p>ever there was call upon him for fair play </p><p>it was now. </p><p> “Yahoya!” He sought to speak sternly,</p><p>but his voice was uncertain, catching a lit- </p><p>tle in his throat. “There is moon-madness </p><p>upon you. You don’t know what it is you </p><p>are saying.” </p><p> She looked at him with a curious smile,</p><p>in which were oddly mingled wonder and </p><p>confidence. </p><p> “Must Yahoya twist her lips into lies</p><p>when her lover comes?” she asked softly. </p><p>“Must she hide her heart because it loves </p><p>you, Yellow Beard?” </p><p> “You are talking nonsense,” he said</p><p>harshly. “You don’t love me and there’s </p><p>no reason why you should. Love doesn’t </p><p>come this way, in a hurry. Just because </p><p>you are used to Indians about you and I </p><p>am the first white man-” </p><p> “You forget Eddie,” she dimpled at him,</p><p>still confident and undisturbed by his words. </p><p>“I did not love Eddie.” </p><p> “Thank God for that! But that’s no rea-</p><p>son you should think you love me. Nor </p><p>any reason that I should love you.” </p><p> She laughed at his earnestness.</p><p> “Your Ups lie well for you, Saxnorthrup.</p><p>But in your eyes I saw the truth before you </p><p>hid it. When you lifted your arms a little, </p><p>like this-” </p><p> Already did Northrup, thinking of the</p><p>coming dawn, foresee complication enough </p><p>without this. Feeling that he must settle </p><p>this matter while the strength of will was </p><p>with him, he said in well simulated anger: </p><p>“Yahoya, listen to me. I did not come </p><p>here seeking a maiden. I came looking for </p><p>gold and turquoises. I have need of them, </p><p>not of a mana. You do not love me and I </p><p>do not love you. Do you understand?” </p><p> He marveled at the lightning - swift</p><p>changes which seemed so natural to this </p><p>girl. In a flash the erect body had grown </p><p>rigid, the laughing mouth hardened cruelly, </p><p>the dark eyes were flashing at him as he </p><p>had seen them flash at old Inaa in a mo- </p><p>ment of anger. </p><p> “So,” she said, and her voice was steady</p><p>and low, but as hard as flint. “So you </p><p>come but to make mock of me? Is that it? </p><p>I offer you my love and you push it aside </p><p>to seize upon gold and cold stones! You </p><p>dare—you dare make light of Yahoya’s </p><p>love?” </p><p> Northrup watched her, uncertain of the</p><p>answer to make. </p><p> “If you are a god,” she said in the same</p><p>cold voice, “I, too, am a goddess; then the </p><p>time will come when I shall learn how to </p><p>make you twist your great body in suffer- </p><p>ing. If you are but a man--” </p><p>26 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> She stooped swiftly, snatching up the</p><p>prayer-stick from the grass. </p><p> “If you are but a man,” and she stretch-</p><p>ed it out over him, “I have but to touch </p><p>you with this and you wither and die!” </p><p>“Try it,” he said bluntly. “You might </p><p>kill a lizard with it; nothing more.” </p><p> A moment she seemed to hesitate, in</p><p>deadly earnest, filled with assurance that </p><p>her curse would annihilate him. Then she </p><p>dropped the baho to the grass again. </p><p> “I think,” she said quietly, “that I shall</p><p>wait until the dawn. That then I shall call </p><p>and Tiyo and the others at my command </p><p>will hurl you out from the rocks. And I </p><p>shall laugh at you while you die horribly, </p><p>Yellow Beard!” </p><p> “I’ll plug a dozen of them full of holes</p><p>first,” grunted Northrup, a real anger be- </p><p>ginning to grow within him. </p><p> God knew he was but seeking to befriend</p><p>her and that she needed a man to lift a </p><p>curse from her. And all that he was getting </p><p>by way of reward was a threat of death. </p><p> “Yahoya,” he said after the flash of an-</p><p>ger, forcing himself to a sane line of thought. </p><p>“I want to tell you something. Will you </p><p>listen to me and try to understand?” </p><p> Now he was the one supplicating; now</p><p>there was a note of eager pleading in his </p><p>voice and she was the one who could deny. </p><p> “Yahoya has wasted enough time amus-</p><p>ing herself with a new plaything,” she said </p><p>with her quaint little queenly air. “Now </p><p>she must go and prepare for the bridal cere- </p><p>mony.” </p><p> She took a step to pass him, but North-</p><p>rup set himself stubbornly in her path. </p><p> “Stand aside!” she commanded him.</p><p>“Or shall I call for Tiyo and his men?” </p><p>“What are you going to do?” he demand- </p><p>ed. “Are you going on with this mad wed- </p><p>ding?” </p><p> “At the dawn,” she informed him coolly,</p><p>“Yahoya will become the bride of the Man </p><p>of Wisdom. After that she will do what </p><p>she likes. It may be that she will have Tiyo </p><p>throw Eddie down the cliffs; it may be that </p><p>she will become a bride again to Tiyo; it </p><p>may be that she will have Tiyo throw Yel- </p><p>low Beard down to join the other Bahana! </p><p>Whatever the Goddess Yahoya wishes done, </p><p>that thing will be done. And now, will you </p><p>stand aside for me to pass?” </p><p> “No!” snapped Northrup. “You are go-</p><p>ing to listen to me if I have to hold you </p><p>while you do it.” </p><p> “You would lay your hand on Yahoya?”</p><p>The wonder at him stood high in her eyes, </p><p>but back of it was a quick look of admira- </p><p>tion. Certainly this man dared much. </p><p> “I’ll take you across my knee and spank</p><p>you in a minute!” he told her in mystifying </p><p>English. </p><p> “Are those magic words, Yellow Beard?”</p><p>she asked quite seriously. </p><p> Northrup grinned a little.</p><p> “They are very magic words, sometimes,”</p><p>he told her. “They have been known to </p><p>work wonders with little girls who didn’t </p><p>mind properly. I want to talk with you, </p><p>about you, Yahoya. Before it is too late.” </p><p>Perhaps it was his earnestness which held </p><p>her; perhaps just the curiosity to know </p><p>what it was he had to say of her. She </p><p>turned back, again making herself comfort- </p><p>able upon her rug. </p><p> “Now,” and it was with a sigh of relief</p><p>that he began, “I want you to tell me again </p><p>of your coming here. Did Inaa, by any </p><p>chance, save any of the garments which </p><p>you wore?” </p><p> “I came down from the emptiness of</p><p>night,” she told him. “My robe was built </p><p>of moonlight and mist.” </p><p> “It’s a wonder you didn’t catch cold,”</p><p>he grinned at her, and he thought that she </p><p>had to fight back an answering smile. “So </p><p>nothing that you wore has been saved?” </p><p>“This only,” and her fingers at her throat </p><p>showed him a glimpse of the gold chain. </p><p>“This came with me from the moon and is </p><p>a magic thing.”</p><p> He put out his hand eagerly for it. It</p><p>might be that after all she had carried with </p><p>her through the years a locket which would </p><p>establish her identity—if he could ever get </p><p>her out of this! </p><p> “Let me look at it.”</p><p> She shook her head.</p><p> “It has never left my throat but the one</p><p>time for a goldsmith to lengthen it. To </p><p>take it off would bring evil. But since you </p><p>are curious, Saxnorthrup, and since it may </p><p>happen that you will die in a few hours, </p><p>you may come close and look.” </p><p> Northrup bent over her, drawing the</p><p>chain out from under her robe. From the </p><p>slender chain hung a little locket, plain </p><p>gold. He found the spring, the locket flew </p><p>open. Within was the picture of a young </p><p>woman who, in this light, might have been </p><p>Yahoya herself. Opposite the picture were </p><p>some two or three words engraved, a full </p><p>Yahoya </p><p>27 </p><p>name he hoped. But he could not make </p><p>them out. </p><p> Well, this was something. If he ever got</p><p>out and got Yahoya away with him, he’d </p><p>never rest until he could tell her who she </p><p>was. </p><p> “About the time that you came here,”</p><p>he asked, “do you remember that the body </p><p>of a white man or woman was found any- </p><p>where in the desert? Where they had given </p><p>out, starving, dying of thirst or a rattle- </p><p>snake bite? And quite near the spot where </p><p>you appeared before Inaa?” </p><p> “No,” she answered, obviously puzzled.</p><p>“Why do you ask that, Yellow Beard?” </p><p>“This is the thing which I wanted to tell </p><p>you, Yahoya.” </p><p> There he stopped hesitantly, trying to</p><p>see just how to go about telling a goddess </p><p>that she was just a girl in spite of her many </p><p>years of belief to the contrary. </p><p> “A good many years ago,” he began</p><p>slowly, “some people, a man and a woman </p><p>and a little girl, perhaps, sought to cross </p><p>the desert. God knows what drove them </p><p>or lured them. We may never know that, </p><p>Yahoya, or it may be that we shall find </p><p>out sometime. At any rate, just before </p><p>they came this far, they died. Perhaps </p><p>their water gave out. The man would try </p><p>to save his water for the woman; she would </p><p>let her little girl drink and go thirsty her- </p><p>self. So it might happen that both man </p><p>and woman would die and the little girl live.” </p><p>He paused again, looking at her to see if </p><p>she began to understand. She was looking </p><p>at him intently. </p><p> “Go on,” she commanded. “The little</p><p>girl, what became of her?” </p><p> “They were white people, Yahoya. The</p><p>little girl was too little to understand all </p><p>that had happened. Maybe her mother, </p><p>dying, or her father, told her to go on to- </p><p>ward the cliffs where they had thought </p><p>they saw a man. The man they saw was </p><p>Inaa, and the little white girl was—you, </p><p>Yahoya!” </p><p> For a long time she sat still and silent,</p><p>staring at him in sheer wonder. Yahoya </p><p>not a goddess! Yahoya a white girl, the </p><p>daughter of a white man and woman who </p><p>had perished miserably on the desert! </p><p> Northrup, seeing the rise and fall of her</p><p>breast in the moonlight, the look which </p><p>had crept into her wide eyes, wondered </p><p>what tumult of thoughts had seethed into </p><p>her brain at his words. It did not enter </p><p>his mind that she would not believe him. </p><p> But he had not counted sufficiently upon</p><p>what a dozen years of training had done for </p><p>her. She had been very, very little when </p><p>she had come to the People of the Hidden </p><p>Spring. Inaa had told her that she was a </p><p>goddess and had bade his people worship her. </p><p> She had heard over and over and over</p><p>the tale of her coming down through the </p><p>night from her distant home in the moon; </p><p>the tale, oft repeated, had grown into fact. </p><p>She did not remember her father and moth- </p><p>er dying of thirst; she thought that she did </p><p>remember her floating down to earth among </p><p>the stars w’hich worshiped her as she went </p><p>by. She had been reared to a belief, a re- </p><p>ligion, which never a doubt had assailed. A </p><p>confidence like hers was not to be shaken </p><p>by the words of the first man who said: </p><p>“You are no goddess, but a mortal Ba- </p><p>hana!” </p><p> “So you dare say to me, Yellow Beard,</p><p>that Yahoya is no true goddess but an im- </p><p>postor? Is that it?” </p><p> “What I have to say is that old Inaa is a</p><p>- scoundrel who has used you for his </p><p>own purposes,” muttered Northrup. “You </p><p>are a girl, just a girl, and God knows there </p><p>is nothing more wonderful than that in the </p><p>world. A girl to whom the going back to </p><p>the world of her kind will be nothing short </p><p>of dipping into fairyland.” </p><p> Yahoya’s sudden laughter surprised him.</p><p>“Fool!” she called him. “Fool and liar! </p><p>To think that I would believe such wild </p><p>tales. It would be well if you remembered </p><p>that you are but a Bahana, Saxnorthrup, </p><p>while I am Yahoya.” </p><p> And he put out no hand now to stop her</p><p>as she went swiftly toward the stone edifice </p><p>under the overhanging cliffs. </p><p> “Here’s a pretty game for a man to play</p><p>out,” he grunted when she was gone. “If </p><p>she were just plain girl things would be bad </p><p>enough. But being a goddess to boot-” </p><p> Here he broke off. Yahoya had left her</p><p>panther-skin behind her. Northrup rolled </p><p>up in it and went to sleep. </p><p>IX </p><p>IN SPITE of the fatigue resting </p><p>like a dead weight upon him North- </p><p>rup dozed more than slept that </p><p>night, waking often. His destiny had </p><p>brought to him a responsibility which he </p><p>accepted unqucstioningly. </p><p>28 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> The whole future life and happiness of</p><p>an extremely unsophisticated girl was upon </p><p>his shoulders and if he played the game fair </p><p>he had her hand as well as his own to play. </p><p>These thoughts alone were sufficient to re- </p><p>strain him from yielding to heavy sleep. </p><p>And, allied with them, was the feeling that </p><p>his new acquaintance, Tiyo, might not be </p><p>averse to creeping up upon him and driving </p><p>a knife into him. </p><p> Through the night he gained the impres-</p><p>sion that Yahoya had not gone to bed. </p><p>Now and then a light moved across the </p><p>door of her stone habitation; once or twice </p><p>he thought that he heard her voice giving </p><p>commands to her attendant maidens. Once </p><p>he was certain that it was her laugh, as </p><p>carefree as if she had never known a shadow </p><p>of trouble or anxiety in her life, that woke </p><p>him. </p><p> The moon had long passed the zenith</p><p>and from bright silver had turned to a milky </p><p>whiteness when he started up to a new </p><p>sound. Since coming to this strange place </p><p>he had heard no voice save his own and </p><p>Yahoya’s; she herself had told him that no </p><p>one would dare speak until she had stood </p><p>out upon the cliff’s edge and sung the sa- </p><p>cred song. But now from the stone house </p><p>came not only her voice but the low rum- </p><p>ble of a man’s utterance. And the tone was </p><p>hard, menacing, oddly unpleasant. </p><p> Northrup got to his feet, stretching his</p><p>body to get the stiffness out of it. He took </p><p>the gun out of its holster and examined it </p><p>to be sure that the clip was full, that it </p><p>might be relied upon in case of need. His </p><p>first thought was that the voice was </p><p>Strang’s. </p><p> “It will be dawn in an hour,” he thought.</p><p>“I wonder what the new day is bringing for </p><p>all of us?” </p><p> He went to the western edge of the cliffs</p><p>and looked down. There was the head- </p><p>quarters of the tribe. He could see ledges </p><p>and steps cut into the face of the precipice, </p><p>could make out countless orifices, rudely cir- </p><p>cular, which no doubt led into intricate </p><p>passageways and numerous small chambers. </p><p> He noted swiftly that the stairways and</p><p>ledges seemed alive with figures of men, </p><p>women and children, and that in long </p><p>streams they were moving downward into </p><p>the canon below. Down there were many </p><p>other figures, clustering in groups where </p><p>their fires burned. Northrup saw with a </p><p>frown what they were doing. Everywhere </p><p>were great jugs, and from jug to jug the </p><p>men were passing, drinking. He saw that </p><p>many of them walked with the unsteady </p><p>step of drunkenness. And all in silence— </p><p>silence, absolute, unbroken by so much as </p><p>a whisper; silence hovering over a drunken </p><p>carousal! </p><p> “When they start things going,” he mut-</p><p>tered, “where is it going to end?” </p><p> Yahoya’s face, the clear-eyed, frank, in-</p><p>genuous face of a girl who should be wear- </p><p>ing her first party gown, flushed with the </p><p>triumph of her first season, rose before him. </p><p>If she had only realized the horror of the </p><p>position in which she stood it seemed to </p><p>Northrup that the situation would have </p><p>been a shade less terrible. But her calm </p><p>serenity in the face of all that encompassed </p><p>her, her dimpling assurance that she was </p><p>the Goddess Yahoya, only to be adored and </p><p>not to be harmed, made him feel toward </p><p>her as he might have felt toward a child </p><p>cooing its happiness over a new discovery </p><p>as it crept toward a rattlesnake. </p><p> He shuddered at the thought and, turn-</p><p>ing away from the silent orgy below, went </p><p>with guarded steps toward the stone build- </p><p>ing. </p><p> The low rumble of the man’s voice, rasp-</p><p>ing impatiently now, was not Strang’s voice. </p><p>Northrup realized that before he had gone </p><p>ten steps. He moved on quietly, coming to </p><p>the door. </p><p> He looked into the one large room which</p><p>constituted the greater part of the build- </p><p>ing’s interior; saw that upon each side a </p><p>smaller door led into what was apparently </p><p>merely an anteroom of some sort; saw Ya- </p><p>hoya, her two maidens and the man who </p><p>was speaking swiftly. The man was Inaa, </p><p>the old priest. His attitude was plainly one </p><p>of dominance and threat now; Yahoya’s </p><p>eyes were filled with amazement. North- </p><p>rup guessed quickly that never had a man</p><p>spoken to her like this before. </p><p> So intent were the four upon what Inaa</p><p>was saying that none of them noted the </p><p>tall form in the shadow outside. Yahoya </p><p>was seated upon some sort of chair over </p><p>which a robe of white skins had been </p><p>thrown. </p><p> For a long moment Northrup’s eyes clung</p><p>to her, wonderingly. Until now he had not </p><p>been struck with the full measure of her </p><p>beauty. Now was there excuse enough for </p><p>superstitious minds to believe her what she </p><p>believed herself. </p><p>Y ahoya </p><p>29 </p><p> There were a score of little lamps in the</p><p>room, set in niches or upon squared stones, </p><p>the cotton wicks soaked in oil shedding a </p><p>bright, soft light. Northrup saw that the </p><p>girl’s eyes were not black but a deep, fath- </p><p>omless gray; that her hair was not the night- </p><p>black hair of Nayangap and Tocha but a </p><p>rich, sun-kissed brown. </p><p> The hair was arranged as the native</p><p>brides wear it, in two great whorls, one at </p><p>each ear, held back from the forehead by a </p><p>broad band of gold above the brows. A </p><p>great turquoise, catching many lights from </p><p>the lamps, shone from the middle of the </p><p>golden band. </p><p> The cotton gown of the early evening to-</p><p>gether with the broad blue sash had been </p><p>discarded for the bridal gown. This was of </p><p>some stuff which could not be but which </p><p>looked the finest silk, snow-white, a cling- </p><p>ing garment which fitted the tender form </p><p>perfectly, which left the arms bare, which </p><p>showed a glimpse of the whiteness of the </p><p>young breast. </p><p> The band about her slim waist was a gir-</p><p>dle of gold, beaten into little squares joined </p><p>cunningly, each adorned with a pendent </p><p>turquoise. Her feet, encased in snow-white </p><p>buckskin moccasins, were crossed before </p><p>her upon the loose folds of the white robe. </p><p> Nayangap and Tocha stood one at each</p><p>side of their mistress, their black eyes wide </p><p>and startled, their lips parted, a look of </p><p>fear upon each face. Inaa’s back was to- </p><p>ward Northrup. The old man’s form was </p><p>tense, his voice vibrant with the emotion </p><p>riding him. </p><p> “It is death to break silence during the</p><p>Festival of Silence,” Yahoya was saying </p><p>now quite calmly, a little curl of contempt </p><p>touching her mouth. “You will go down to </p><p>the Skeleton House, Inaa, before the day is </p><p>born and dies again!” </p><p> Inaa’s grunt was eloquent of his defiance.</p><p>“Will you not let the maidens go, oh, Ya- </p><p>hoya?” he demanded in a tone which told </p><p>that the same demand before had met with </p><p>her refusal. “The thing which I have to </p><p>say, for which I have dared break silence</p><p>before the time, is not for them to hear.” </p><p>“I have told you,” she answered him </p><p>steadily, “that it is my will that my maid- </p><p>ens stay with me. Surely with old age mad- </p><p>ness has come upon you! You are great </p><p>among your people, Inaa, but do you for- </p><p>get that you are only an old man, soon to </p><p>die? The Skeleton Old Man has one hand </p><p>upon your beard now! Be careful what </p><p>you say, how you speak to Yahoya!” </p><p> Again Inaa’s grunt, making Northrup</p><p>vaguely uneasy. The old man was unmoved </p><p>by Yahoya’s words, and his attitude was </p><p>plainly untinged by respect. </p><p> “Let the maids stay,” he said gruffly.</p><p>“It matters not. If,” and as he turned a </p><p>little Northrup could see the evil glance he </p><p>shot at them, making them cringe back </p><p>from it, “if they speak later of what hap- </p><p>pens here tonight they will go at once and </p><p>for all time to a lover who has cold arms </p><p>and lies in darkness.” </p><p> He paused a moment, staring from under</p><p>his gathered brows at Yahoya. Then he </p><p>spoke swiftly, his voice lowered, unspeak- </p><p>ably stern. </p><p> “There is little time, for what I have to</p><p>say must be finished before the first dawn </p><p>comes. Yahoya, at dawn you will sing the </p><p>sacred song?” </p><p> “Will the sun rise?” she mocked him.</p><p>“And afterward,” he retorted, “you will </p><p>wed?” </p><p> “Do you think,” she answered, her tone</p><p>filled with sarcasm, “that Yahoya can find </p><p>a man among all these men who will wed </p><p>with so ugly a mana?” </p><p> “You think that you will put out your</p><p>hand and that the Man of Wisdom will </p><p>come? You will wed him?” </p><p> “Oho!” she laughed, leaning a little for-</p><p>ward, her mocking eyes upon the old </p><p>priest’s. “And are you jealous, Inaa? With </p><p>madness has youth run back into your cold </p><p>blood, making it hot again? Do you covet </p><p>Yahoya!” </p><p> And again she flung her laughter at him,</p><p>playing with him, finding vent for the an-</p><p>ger which he had whipped up in her. Inaa </p><p>lifted his hand as if to stop her. And Ya- </p><p>hoya’s laughter taunted him until she had </p><p>done. </p><p> “It is my desire,” he said angrily, “that</p><p>you wed one of my own people. It is my </p><p>desire, Yahoya, that you wed Tiyo, my </p><p>son. It is also his desire. And,” the words </p><p>coming coldly, “it is my command!” </p><p>SLOWLY Yahoya’s face went </p><p>white. She did not move but seem- </p><p>ed for a long moment a statue ready </p><p>to be wakened into life but as yet cold mar- </p><p>ble. </p><p> Then the blood sprang back into her</p><p>cheeks, racing hotly through her veins, a </p><p>30 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>red tide of anger. Northrup drew a deep </p><p>breath and stared at her fascinated, forget- </p><p>ful for the instant of Inaa. The girl stirred </p><p>a little where she sat, then grew still, only </p><p>her quick breathing and flashing eyes and </p><p>the color in her cheeks hinting at the tu- </p><p>mult in her breast. </p><p> “The others are drinking in the canon,”</p><p>she said coolly. “Have you too drunk deep- </p><p>ly, Inaa? Or are you eager to have the </p><p>vengeance of Yahoya strike?” </p><p> “Fool!” snarled Inaa. “Must I, though</p><p>an old man, be afraid of you, a soft-bodied </p><p>girl? For the thing I have to tell you, Ya- </p><p>hoya, is that you are a girl and no goddess; </p><p>just a girl as Nayangap there and Tocha, </p><p>but with the white body of the Ba- </p><p>hana.” </p><p> Northrup felt that he could have patted</p><p>the old villain on the back for that. For, if </p><p>anything were to be done for her, the soon- </p><p>er Yahoya got her ideas of her own divinity </p><p>out of her head, the better. </p><p> “A girl, a girl with white skin, but just a</p><p>girl,” he gibed, mocking her as she had </p><p>mocked him. “A girl I put where she is; a </p><p>girl I can pull down and give to the village </p><p>to play with when I wish. Would you like, </p><p>oh, dainty Yahoya, to have the hard hands </p><p>of many drunken men pull you this way </p><p>and that? Or would you like to obey the </p><p>command of Inaa and wed Tiyo—and so </p><p>remain to the people what Inaa made you, </p><p>a goddess? You must decide swiftly, for </p><p>the dawn is coming and does not wait, Ya- </p><p>hoya, because a white maid bids it to!” </p><p> Nayangap and Tocha gasped, turning</p><p>their bewildered eyes from their mistress to </p><p>the old priest, back to where Yahoya sat </p><p>motionless. </p><p> Slowly now Yahoya stirred, her gaze go-</p><p>ing to Nayangap, then to Tocha. </p><p> “You have heard Inaa speak,” she said</p><p>very quietly. “You have seen one high in </p><p>the thoughts of the gods stricken with mad- </p><p>ness. In a little those gods will gather him </p><p>to them, Nayangap and Tocha. You </p><p>will see; his death has left the underworld</p><p>to bring him thither. And harken well—” </p><p>her voice rising a little—“you maidens who </p><p>have heard must forget that you have </p><p>heard! I have commanded, I, Yahoya!” </p><p> Even yet she did not believe. Though</p><p>two men had told her, first Northrup, who </p><p>claimed her one of his own blood, next Inaa, </p><p>who told her of his own trickery, Yahoya </p><p>would not believe. Too deeply had the </p><p>training of a lifetime sunken into her mind </p><p>to be wiped out in an instant. </p><p> Inaa’s rage, curbed until now, burst its</p><p>bonds. With black, distorted face, with his </p><p>hands thrown out like claws of a beast, he </p><p>leaped at her. </p><p> “Goddess, are you, Yahoya?” he snarled</p><p>at her. “Inaa will teach wisdom to a white- </p><p>bodied fool! If you are goddess and no </p><p>maid then may you fling an old man away </p><p>with no effort.” </p><p> Northrup, unprepared for the sudden at-</p><p>tack, saw Yahoya dragged from her seat, </p><p>dragged down so that she was upon her </p><p>knees, the priest’s hands at her throat. Ya- </p><p>hoya struggled, but his strength in his rage </p><p>was ten times the strength of a girl, and she </p><p>could not so much as cry out. Her two </p><p>maids stood transfixed with horror. </p><p> It was but an instant. Northrup, gather-</p><p>ing his strength in a sudden flare of anger </p><p>scarcely less than the frenzy of Inaa, threw </p><p>himself upon the old man, gripped his wrists </p><p>and ripped them away, flinging Inaa far </p><p>from him so that he staggered across the </p><p>room and struck the far wall. </p><p> “You infernal cur!” cried the white man.</p><p> He turned away from the blinking, evil</p><p>eyes to where Yahoya, white-faced and </p><p>panting, was staring at them like one rudely </p><p>awaked from a nightmare. </p><p> “Why won’t you believe?” he asked her</p><p>sharply. “It is almost the dawn; your </p><p>whole life is in your hands now for a few </p><p>minutes. Why spoil it with an insane idea? </p><p>Can’t you see that you are just a girl, as he </p><p>says? My God! Won’t you see it?” </p><p> In the girl’s eyes were so many emotions</p><p>striving for mastery over her that North-</p><p>rup could not guess what passed in her </p><p>mind. She opened her lips but did not </p><p>speak. He had felt a little spurt of anger </p><p>at her, too, that she let her stubbornness lie </p><p>in the way of her welfare. Now he felt only </p><p>a deep pity for her. In a rude moment he </p><p>and Inaa had tried to wrest from under her </p><p>feet the whole belief of her life. Small won- </p><p>der that she stared at them like that! </p><p> “Yahoya,” he went on gently, “can’t you</p><p>understand it? And can’t you see that it </p><p>is a better thing to be a white girl after all </p><p>than a goddess of these cursed Indians? </p><p>Why, a world is open to you now that is as </p><p>wonderful as the world of the gods which </p><p>you have let yourself dream of. It will be </p><p>like paradise for a girl at your age to come </p><p>into the Twentieth Century outside! </p><p>Yahoya </p><p>3i </p><p>And—” again under the emotion upon him </p><p>he broke into quick English—“if you’ll just </p><p>buck up I’ll send you out of this mess if we </p><p>have to shoot our way out!” </p><p> Yahoya, looking at him a moment curi-</p><p>ously, turned and without a word went into </p><p>the anteroom at the left, dropping a curtain </p><p>after her. Northrup swung about, seeking </p><p>Inaa. The old man had slipped away. </p><p>X </p><p>|||||j|| “GO TO your mistress!” Northrup </p><p>8|!||J commanded the two trembling girls. </p><p> “And remember, goddess or maid,</p><p>she is your mistress!” </p><p> He went outside. Yahoya must have</p><p>time to think before he tried further to talk </p><p>with her. And he himself wanted to think. </p><p>Inaa, none too sweet-tempered an old ras- </p><p>cal at the best, would be up to mischief now. </p><p>His anger would include Northrup as well as </p><p>Yahoya. It would be just as well to look </p><p>for nearly anything now. </p><p> But he had not looked for what had al-</p><p>ready begun. His eyes, seeking Inaa, had </p><p>gone naturally to the far edge of the cliff </p><p>where the steps of stone led down to the </p><p>canon where the tribe was drinking. He </p><p>did not see Inaa, but saw a head rising as a </p><p>man climbed upward. At first he had no </p><p>suspicion who the man was, as Strang had </p><p>gone from his mind, and this was not the </p><p>Strang he had known. </p><p> Strang’s breast showed as he came up.</p><p>Then, from the base of the cliff what had </p><p>looked a shadow there resolved itself in- </p><p>to a man’s form, leaping out upon Strang. </p><p>The moonlight fell upon the fellow and </p><p>showed Northrup Tiyo’s dark face, the </p><p>teeth showing, the eyes gleaming murder- </p><p>ously. The knife which already had threat- </p><p>ened Northrup was flung up above Strang’s </p><p>head. </p><p> The two white men must have seen the</p><p>Indian at the same moment. Simultane- </p><p>ously their quick cries shot through the still- </p><p>ness. Strang leaped up the last of the steps, </p><p>throwing himself to the side as Tiyo came</p><p>at him. He had had but the instant to de- </p><p>cide and had decided upon taking the </p><p>chance here upon the level rather than seek- </p><p>ing to descend a hazardous way, leaving his </p><p>enemy over him. </p><p> But Tiyo had had time to plan for all</p><p>things. As Strang turned to the side the </p><p>Indian sprang upon him. Northrup saw </p><p>the moonlight gleam on the uplifted blade, </p><p>heard the little grunt with which Tiyo </p><p>brought it down, heard the thud of the im- </p><p>pact and for the second thought that all of </p><p>Strang’s accounts were squared. </p><p> Then, gripping his automatic, having no</p><p>chance to shoot from here, he ran to the </p><p>two forms which were rolling close to the </p><p>precipice. As he leaped forward, Yahoya, </p><p>having heard the cries, came running by </p><p>her maidens to stand in the doorway, watch- </p><p>ing them. </p><p> Tiyo’s knife had drunk blood, but not</p><p>from the body of the writhing man, having </p><p>found a sheath only in the outflung fore- </p><p>arm. Now Strang, a tall man, made into </p><p>iron from his months on the desert, was </p><p>fighting as a maddened animal fights for its </p><p>life. His hand had grown into a steel band </p><p>about Tiyo’s wrist, was forcing the knife </p><p>back from him. And still, like two great </p><p>fighting cats, the two men now were almost </p><p>at the edge of nothingness. </p><p> The Indian, seeing a chance, dropped his</p><p>knife so that it fell against the rock floor at </p><p>his left side. As quick as lightning he had </p><p>swept it up again in his left hand, had whip- </p><p>ped it up so that again it caught the moon- </p><p>light. And then Northrup, throwing him- </p><p>self forward, was in time. His great fin- </p><p>gers shut about the Indian’s left wrist, grip- </p><p>ping it as Strang gripped the other. </p><p> A moment of breathless struggle in which</p><p>the muscles of the three men stood out </p><p>mightily. Then the three bodies relaxed as </p><p>the knife came away in Northrup’s hand, </p><p>and Strang and Tiyo, rolling over swiftly, </p><p>got to their feet. </p><p> “Well done, Yellow Beard!”</p><p> Yahoya’s young voice came ringing to</p><p>them; Yahoya herself had come quickly to </p><p>Northrup’s side, looking up into his face.</p><p>And again the man saw in the woman’s face, </p><p>unhidden, the admiration which looked out </p><p>at him frankly. </p><p> Beyond the emotion which he had arous-</p><p>ed in her she seemed unmoved by what she </p><p>had seen. She was laughing softly when </p><p>she said: </p><p> “It is in Yahoya’s heart to make you love</p><p>her, Saxnorthrup.” </p><p> Strang whirled about suddenly. Until</p><p>now his watchful eyes had been for Tiyo </p><p>alone. The name, even as Yahoya pro- </p><p>nounced it, brought him peering into North- </p><p>rup’s face. </p><p> “Northrup!” There was almost a gasp</p><p>32 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>of fear in the voice. “You—you didn’t die </p><p>then?” </p><p> “I think not,” Northrup assured him</p><p>coolly. “Otherwise I should not have had </p><p>the privilege of saving you a throat-cut- </p><p>ting.” </p><p> “- him!” spat out Strang, his eyes</p><p>again going to the Indian. “I’ll get him for </p><p>this.” </p><p> Tiyo’s face, a moment ago a picture of</p><p>the hot rage and hatred within him, now </p><p>showed nothing. With an elaborate as- </p><p>sumption of nonchalance, he lifted his shoul- </p><p>ders and turned to go down the steps. </p><p>Northrup, watching him go, noted that not </p><p>once had the man spoken, that now his lips </p><p>were sealed. The suspicion came to him </p><p>that Tiyo, like the rest of his simple people, </p><p>had been tricked by the old priest into a </p><p>certainty that Yahoya was a goddess and </p><p>did not dare speak until she, singing the sa- </p><p>cred song, had given the signal. </p><p> “So you are alive?” demanded Strang as</p><p>if he could not be convinced. “And you </p><p>have got here?” </p><p> He was frowning, his eyes deeply thought-</p><p>ful. He seemed already to have forgotten </p><p>Tiyo and that but for Northrup’s coming </p><p>Tiyo’s knife would have drunk more deep- </p><p>ly. There was no gratitude in his sharp </p><p>glance; but there was displeasure and sus- </p><p>picion. As quick as a flash his eyes went </p><p>from Northrup to Yahoya’s face where a </p><p>man must read what she did not seek to </p><p>hide. </p><p> “Curse it!” cried Strang. “Haven’t I got</p><p>enough on my hands already? What the </p><p>devil do you want here?” </p><p> Northrup grunted his disgust of the</p><p>man. </p><p> “In the first place,” he said coolly, “I</p><p>want a talk with you. And I want it right </p><p>now, before daybreak. If you’ve got a </p><p>shred of decency in you, if you’ve got a </p><p>drop of sporting blood, which I don’t be- </p><p>lieve you have, I have a proposition to</p><p>make you.” </p><p>STRANG, gripping his wounded </p><p>arm as he followed, they went back </p><p>into Yahoya’s house. For North- </p><p>rup wanted what privacy there was to be </p><p>had. And he wanted what light he might </p><p>have upon Strang’s face. </p><p> Yahoya, unbidden but frankly interested,</p><p>went with them. As they began speaking </p><p>in a language which was unknown to her, </p><p>she frowned a little and watched them the </p><p>more closely. </p><p> “Here’s a girl who’s in a nasty mess,”</p><p>Northrup began abruptly. “She’s white </p><p>and she’s the plaything of a dirty old sav- </p><p>age. We’ve got to get her out of this. It’s </p><p>a sight more than a one - man job or I </p><p>wouldn’t ask your help. The mere fact </p><p>that there is no love between you and me </p><p>doesn’t cut any figure in a case like this. </p><p>Will you tuck in and help me get her out?” </p><p>Strang’s head was down as he sought to </p><p>bind up his wound. When he looked up it </p><p>was first at Yahoya. He studied her face </p><p>intently, then turned to Northrup. Then </p><p>of Northrup he demanded sharply: </p><p> “Have you talked with her? Do you un-</p><p>derstand their lingo?”	&gt;</p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “What have you told her? Does she</p><p>know that the goddess stuff is all bunk?” </p><p> “I have told her. But she doesn’t believe</p><p>me. Inaa told her and she thought that he </p><p>was lying.” </p><p> There was a gleam in Strang’s eye which</p><p>told Northrup what he might expect even </p><p>before Strang’s voice demanded bluntly: </p><p>“Well? If she wants to believe it, what’s </p><p>the difference?” </p><p> “What difference?” cried Northrup hot-</p><p>ly. “We’ve got to get her out, I tell you. </p><p>And it looks as if we’d have to go on the </p><p>run. Unless she gets that fool notion out </p><p>of her head, I’ve got my doubts if she’ll be </p><p>willing to go with us and leave what she </p><p>looks upon as her people.” </p><p> Strang’s brows contracted into a quick</p><p>frown. </p><p> “I know your sort pretty well, Sax North-</p><p>rup,” he said sharply. “You’re the kind of </p><p>man who likes to run things pretty much </p><p>his own way and to - with the other </p><p>fellow. Here you butt in where I’ve been </p><p>six months and at the jump are telling me </p><p>what ‘we’ are going to do! Hasn’t it en- </p><p>tered your head that perhaps I’ve decided </p><p>for myself what I am going to do? And </p><p>what this girl is going to do? And, by </p><p>Heaven! You can put it in your pipe and </p><p>smoke it right now that she is going to do </p><p>what I tell her to do!” </p><p> Northrup bit back the words which came</p><p>to his lips. Now was no time to quarrel </p><p>with Strang. And, since no human being is </p><p>altogether vicious, he still hoped to find a </p><p>hint of decency somewhere in Strang. </p><p>“Would you mind telling me what your </p><p>Yahoya </p><p>33 </p><p>plans are?” he asked quietly. “Things are </p><p>going to happen pretty fast now, you </p><p>know.” </p><p> A little color came into Strang’s bronzed</p><p>cheeks, a quick bright light like a flame into </p><p>his eyes. </p><p> “So you’ll listen to reason, will you?” he</p><p>demanded, making the mistake of thinking </p><p>himself the bigger man at that moment. </p><p>“You can just bet things are going to hap- </p><p>pen in a hurry. I’m going to get Tiyo’s </p><p>tag to begin with, the murderous young </p><p>hound! And I’m going to put a crimp into </p><p>Inaa’s game that will make him dizzy. </p><p>And, so that you won’t make any mistakes, </p><p>Northrup, I’ll tell you right now who’s run- </p><p>nin’ the whole show here. It’s Ed Strang! </p><p>What I’ve got I’m going to hold on to; what </p><p>I haven’t got—I’m going to get. And I’m </p><p>going to keep it—just as long as I want </p><p>it!” </p><p> His eyes went swiftly to the splendid</p><p>form of Yahoya, clung there a moment and </p><p>then, defiantly, came back to Northrup. </p><p> “You are just one man against a whole</p><p>tribe,” Northrup reminded him, keeping </p><p>the anger out of his voice though for an in- </p><p>stant his eyes were on fire with it. “Has it </p><p>occurred to you that they will let you go </p><p>just as far as it pleases them? And that </p><p>then they will know how to bring you up </p><p>with a rather ugly jerk?” </p><p> Strang’s air while he was speaking had</p><p>subtly changed. Now, if in truth he were </p><p>not the master of the situation, he thought </p><p>that he was. From confidence he went to </p><p>insolence. </p><p> “I’ve been here six months, you’ve been</p><p>here a few hours, and so you advise and </p><p>warn,” he laughed impudently. “And, if </p><p>you want to know, I am not one man against </p><p>a tribe. The tribe is split square in two, and </p><p>by-! I’m the man that split it! Inaa is </p><p>going down to make room for another man </p><p>who’s hungering after his job. Tiyo is go- </p><p>ing the same way to make place for a sort </p><p>of tribal captain who belongs to me. Do</p><p>you begin to see, Sax Northrup?” </p><p> Northrup saw, knew that Strang was tell-</p><p>ing him the truth, and understood that in </p><p>sober truth Strang might have made him- </p><p>self the power to reckon with here. Then </p><p>Yahoya . . . </p><p> “It won’t work,” he said quietly. “You</p><p>can’t get away with it, Strang, and you </p><p>ought to know it. You might put it over </p><p>for a while, but the bottom will drop out of </p><p>the whole thing sooner or later. And I </p><p>think it will be sooner.” </p><p> “It will, will it? You wouldn’t mind ex-</p><p>plaining how and why?” </p><p> “Because where one white man has gone</p><p>another follows. Where two have been </p><p>many will come. If I don’t take this girl </p><p>out with me I’ll come back for her. And I </p><p>won’t come alone.” </p><p> Again Strang’s assurance rang in his</p><p>laugh. </p><p> “Has the thought occurred to you that</p><p>maybe you won’t go out at all?” </p><p> Northrup stared at him incredulously.</p><p>Strang had risen, or fallen, to levels North- </p><p>rup had not thought open to him. </p><p> “Frankly, it hadn’t. I generally go where</p><p>I want to go. While we are threshing things </p><p>out you might tell me what you are driving </p><p>at.” </p><p> “I’m driving at this: I’ve stumbled on</p><p>to something here which, if I work it the </p><p>one right way, will put me in a place where </p><p>I can make the Astors and Morgans shine </p><p>my shoes. If I let you go your way out of </p><p>here to blab, I stand to lose the whole </p><p>thing. So you are not going to get out! Is </p><p>that plain enough?” </p><p> “You’re taking over a pretty big con-</p><p>tract, aren’t you?” asked Northrup stead- </p><p>ily. “I don’t see how you’re going to pre- </p><p>vent me going out, unless you get some of </p><p>your friends to stick a knife into me. And </p><p>you won’t do that.” </p><p> “How do you know I won’t?” snapped</p><p>Strang.</p><p> “Because you haven’t got the nerve,” re-</p><p>torted Northrup. “I know your kind, too. </p><p>You’d go off and leave a man to die alone </p><p>in the desert, because you’re an infernal </p><p>coward! Too much of a coward to kill a </p><p>man or to make somebody else do it. </p><p>You’re short on nerve, Strang.” </p><p> Strang’s lips twitched a little, but his</p><p>eyes held hard to Northrup’s, and the cool </p><p>dare in them. After a brief, hesitant mo- </p><p>ment he whirled about and went to the </p><p>door. Yahoya, who had guessed what she </p><p>might of the conversation, flashed a quick </p><p>glance at Northrup and smiled. </p><p> Almost immediately Strang came back.</p><p>He pointed outside. Northrup, looking, </p><p>saw six men, one after the other, come si- </p><p>lently up from, the canon. He noted that </p><p>all, excepting one only, were tall, sinewy </p><p>young men of superb physiques, and that </p><p>they were fully armed, each carrying two </p><p>34 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>great-bladed knives at his belt, and in his </p><p>hand a short thrusting-spear. The one man </p><p>who had passed the prime of life looked a </p><p>patriarch. Hair and beard were snow </p><p>white; he was great-framed and erect; his </p><p>eyes flashed as if with youth. </p><p> “Inaa’s successor,” said Strang, taking on</p><p>again his marked manner of one supreme in </p><p>power. “And the first of the young men is </p><p>Muyingwa who is hungering after Tiyo’s </p><p>job. They are friends of mine, as you call </p><p>them, Northrup. Don’t forget that. And </p><p>there are more of them coming.” </p><p> “And I can drop the whole gang in their</p><p>tracks if need be before they can get within </p><p>knifing distance,” answered Northrup, un- </p><p>derstanding what lay back of Strang’s air </p><p>of authority. </p><p> “And in the end get a two-edged knife</p><p>through you,” came the swift answer. </p><p>“You know that. You wouldn’t have a </p><p>chance in the world. If you did getaway </p><p>for the minute, what would you do? Run </p><p>out into the desert without taking time to </p><p>get a drink of water, eh?” </p><p> “Go ahead, Strang. You haven’t entire-</p><p>ly outlined your plan.” </p><p> “So you’re ready-to walk easy and talk</p><p>easier, are you?” sneered Strang. </p><p> Still standing at the door he flung out his</p><p>hand a trifle theatrically. The six men stop- </p><p>ped dead in their tracks. He turned a smile </p><p>upon Northrup. </p><p> “You see? Now maybe you’ll listen. I</p><p>haven’t got anything against you, North- </p><p>rup, and I’d let you go and be glad of it if </p><p>I could. But I tell you I can’t work this </p><p>game in a day. It’s too big; the stakes—I </p><p>tell you I can make the big men on Wall </p><p>Street look sick! If I took a chance on you </p><p>and you squealed when you got out, then </p><p>what? I can’t do it.” </p><p> “That’s about enough sop to your con-</p><p>science,” cut in Northrup. “What do you </p><p>think you are going to do with me?” </p><p> “I’m going to keep you here until I can</p><p>get out. I need a man like you. There are </p><p>mines here, gold-mines—it makes me dizzy </p><p>to think about it—which these fool Indians </p><p>have never worked beyond scratching the </p><p>top like a flock of clucking hens! You are </p><p>going into the mines; you are going to drive </p><p>the men I give you and drive them hard. </p><p>You are going to clean up more money for </p><p>me than you ever saw. And when I get </p><p>away and it goes with me, then you can do </p><p>as you-please!” </p><p> “Many thanks,” said Northrup dryly.</p><p>“It doesn’t sound good to me, Strang.” </p><p>Before Strang could answer, the young </p><p>Indian whom he had made known as Muy- </p><p>ingwa came on, leaving his fellows. He </p><p>raised his hand in salute twice, first to </p><p>Strang, second to Yahoya. </p><p>His eyes ran by them all, flashed a greet- </p><p>ing which was filled with triumph at the </p><p>girl Nayangap, standing in the ante- </p><p>room door. Then, his eyes upon Strang, he </p><p>lifted his hand and pointed toward the east. </p><p>It was the first light of the dawn. </p><p>Northrup swung about toward Yahoya. </p><p>“Yahoya,” he said quickly, “you must </p><p>listen to me.” </p><p> “I listen, Yellow Beard,” she said, look-</p><p>ing at him curiously. </p><p> “What do you want to talk to her about?”</p><p>demanded Strang in sharp suspicion. “Keep </p><p>your hands off, Sax Northrup. She’s mine, </p><p>and you will do well to keep it in mind.” </p><p>“Yours? You contemptible coward!” </p><p>Northrup flung at him, his anger at last </p><p>snapping its leash. “You would trade on </p><p>her superstition and ignorance and then </p><p>throw her away when you got tired, would </p><p>you? Now I am going to talk with her and </p><p>you are going outside while I do it.” </p><p> “Am I?” jeered Strang. “So you’ve got</p><p>a notion to the pretty innocent yourself, </p><p>have you? If you think I’ve kept my hands </p><p>off her this long just so you can have </p><p>her-” </p><p> Northrup shut Strang’s mouth with a</p><p>blow which brought the blood and sent </p><p>Strang reeling out through the door. </p><p> “Come in and I’ll kill you,” he said, his</p><p>voice dropped low and grown husky. “I </p><p>mean that, Strang.”</p><p> Strang hesitated, then went swiftly to</p><p>Muyingwa and the others who had come </p><p>closer. Northrup paid no further attention </p><p>to him save always to keep him in sight. </p><p> “Yahoya,” he said as gently as he could</p><p>with the emotions riding him. “You must </p><p>believe me. You are a girl, a Bahana like </p><p>me. Inaa has tricked you. Strang knows </p><p>it. Strang is a bad man in a good many </p><p>ways, Yahoya. I’d rather see you marry </p><p>Tiyo than him. Tiyo at least loves you, I </p><p>think. Strang plans on getting rid of Tiyo </p><p>and Inaa, on putting two other men in their </p><p>places—that old man out there and Muy- </p><p>ingwa. Then Strang will be chief man here </p><p>and he will do what he pleases with you. </p><p>Do you understand, Yahoya?” </p><p>Yahoya </p><p>35 </p><p> “I understand,” she said curiously, “that</p><p>you say I am no true goddess but a mere </p><p>girl, like Nayangap and Tocha there, but </p><p>white. Why do you lie to me, Yellow </p><p>Beard?” </p><p> “Lie to you?” he cried. “Can’t you see</p><p>it’s the truth. Cut your hand and it will </p><p>bleed; put it in the fire and the fire will </p><p>burn it; go without food and water and you </p><p>will die like the rest of us! Can’t you see? </p><p>You’re just a God-blessed girl, Yahoya, and </p><p>no goddess.” </p><p> She shook her head, the odd smile still in</p><p>her eyes. </p><p> “The dawn is coming, Yellow Beard,” she</p><p>said softly. “I must go. The people wait </p><p>for Yahoya.” </p><p> “But,” he cried after her, “you must not</p><p>marry Strang-” </p><p> “The Goddess Yahoya promised,” she told</p><p>him steadily. “A goddess must not lie.” </p><p>XI </p><p>NOT the most patient of men, </p><p>Northrup was tempted to express </p><p>himself in very strong words and to </p><p>inform Miss Yahoya that from now on she </p><p>could do as she pleased for all of him, either </p><p>go to Strang or the devil and be done with </p><p>it. Nor did the smile which she turned on </p><p>Strang as she went by him soften North- </p><p>rup’s mood. </p><p> “I have broken the sacred silence, O Ya-</p><p>hoya, goddess!” Strang was scarcely more </p><p>than whispering and yet Northrup’s eager </p><p>ears caught the words clearly enough. “But </p><p>it was because harm was threatened you </p><p>and I feared for you. Am I forgiven?” </p><p>“Am I true goddess, then, Eddie?” she </p><p>asked softly. </p><p> “The white man in yonder says you are</p><p>not,” he answered quickly, his eyes watch- </p><p>ful of her slightest change of expression. </p><p>“He is a liar. Inaa says you are not; he is </p><p>a false priest, bewitched. They shall both </p><p>suffer for it, Yahoya. Tiyo denies your</p><p>godliness. He too shall suffer. Shall they </p><p>not, Yahoya?” </p><p> “Take them when you will!” she said,</p><p>her eyes flaming; and so she passed on. </p><p> Northrup shrugged his shoulders. He</p><p>told himself that he had done his best and </p><p>that he were a mad fool to attempt any- </p><p>thing further in the face of what confront- </p><p>ed him. But since madness had the way of </p><p>galloping down his blood when crises came, </p><p>he was by no means sure what the ending </p><p>might be. He knew that he would watch; </p><p>that if Strang or his crowd sought to lay </p><p>hands on one Sax Northrup, there was going </p><p>to be a fight worth a man’s while. </p><p> As Yahoya, walking erect and swiftly</p><p>across the level space, came to the cliff’s </p><p>edge, Strang, followed by the old patriarch- </p><p>al figure, Muyingwa and the other young </p><p>men, went close behind her. Northrup </p><p>noted the glance which passed between </p><p>Muyingwa and the girl, Nayangap, a </p><p>glance easily understood since there was </p><p>not much difference between it and the </p><p>glance which might pass between two young </p><p>people in a box at the opera. Then North- </p><p>rup strode out after the others. </p><p> If there was to be a fight it was well to</p><p>plan a bit while there was time. He forced </p><p>his mind to this now and away from Ya- </p><p>hoya. </p><p> He saw that the Indians, heavily armed</p><p>as they were, might be held off by a man </p><p>with an automatic and plenty of ammuni- </p><p>tion. He saw that if Strang carried a gun </p><p>it was hidden about his clothes. He did </p><p>not believe that Strang had any sort of fire- </p><p>arm upon him. It would have been the </p><p>natural thing for the man’s hand to have </p><p>gone its way to his hip when Northrup had </p><p>struck him in the mouth; and he had made </p><p>no such gesture. There were a thousand </p><p>ways in which a man, out on the desert for </p><p>months, might have lost his weapon. </p><p> “If I’m the only man here with a gun,”</p><p>pondered Northrup, “they’ll have their </p><p>work cut out for them if they start any- </p><p>thing.” </p><p> He could withdraw toward the other</p><p>steps, up which he had come from the first</p><p>canon. In the narrow passageway he could </p><p>hold them back while he swept up the jug </p><p>of water. After that, what was to be would </p><p>be. </p><p> The dawn had come at last. Yahoya,</p><p>standing upon the brink of the precipice, </p><p>stood very still, her head thrown back a </p><p>little, her eyes upon the pale moon, her </p><p>arms lifted. Northrup came closer to the </p><p>edge and looked down. </p><p> The dark forms there were quiet, had</p><p>grown as motionless as Yahoya’s own. The </p><p>whole tribe gathered there stood with lifted </p><p>arms, with faces turned up. Now and then </p><p>when a form stirred Northrup could see that </p><p>it was a stagger of drunkenness, could guess </p><p>that the stuff which they had been drinking </p><p>36 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>was the terribly intoxicating juice of the </p><p>agave, which, fermented in rawhide bags, </p><p>puts frenzy into men. </p><p> Suddenly through the silence floated Ya-</p><p>hoya’s voice, singing softly. She was chant- </p><p>ing the sacred song, the song which people </p><p>said she was singing when she appeared be- </p><p>fore Inaa out of the night. She gave the </p><p>words strange little twists of mispronuncia- </p><p>tion—but the words were English! There </p><p>was no doubting that they were English, or </p><p>rather that they had been English when </p><p>Yahoya’s baby voice had sung them for the </p><p>first time into Inaa’s ears. </p><p> It struck Northrup as an odd little thing</p><p>that this song alone should have remained </p><p>to the girl of the tongue which had been </p><p>her mother’s, this song which she could not </p><p>understand, but whose sounds had been </p><p>kept fresh through frequent repetition. </p><p> And, somehow, the whole thing struck</p><p>him as more pitiful than amusing, although </p><p>both elements mixed into it. Here was Ya- </p><p>hoya, who had called him liar for saying she </p><p>was no true goddess, singing in all serious- </p><p>ness her sacred song; down there, far below, </p><p>was a tribe of Indians listening to her sa- </p><p>cred song with a sort of reverence. And the </p><p>song itself was a nursery jingle! </p><p> Buzzfuzz was a jolly fly,</p><p> Very blithe and gay!</p><p> He began his lively dance</p><p> With the break of day.</p><p> Up and down the window-pane</p><p> With a dainty tread,</p><p> Sometimes on his tiptoes slides,</p><p>Sometimes on his head! </p><p> Northrup caught a grin on Strang’s face</p><p>and could have kicked him for it. In his </p><p>own eyes he felt a sting of salt mist. He </p><p>no longer had a desire to laugh at Yahoya </p><p>or at the face-lifted crowd below. He no </p><p>longer felt resentment toward the girl. He </p><p>did feel a quick impulse to sweep her up </p><p>into his arms, to hold her tightly, as one</p><p>might hold a very little, motherless child; </p><p>to carry her away from here and make life </p><p>over for her. </p><p> THE song died away and the still-</p><p>ness of the Festival of Silence went </p><p>with it. A thunder of voices crash- </p><p>ed through the night. Wild yells, until now </p><p>pent up in riotous breasts, broke out every- </p><p>where. And though the voices seemed cry- </p><p>ing all things in the world, from everywhere </p><p>rose the shout: </p><p> “Yahoya! Yahoya! Yahoya!”</p><p> Down yonder the forms were circling</p><p>drunkenly now—men, women and children </p><p>stopping only that they might drink, reel- </p><p>ing more and more, shouting, lifting their </p><p>voices in shrill, finely drawn notes, like the </p><p>yapping of a thousand coyotes. </p><p> But from the seething mess came out</p><p>several forms, walking swiftly and straight. </p><p>From here there was no need to look twice </p><p>to see that it was the old priest, Inaa, who </p><p>led them. Close behind him came Tiyo and </p><p>after him a score of young men, all armed </p><p>as were the followers of Strang. They were </p><p>now coming up the steps. Northrup looked </p><p>quickly to see what Strang was doing. </p><p> He had gathered about him the half-</p><p>dozen men who had come with him and was </p><p>giving sharp orders. Northrup marveled a </p><p>little to see them, one after the other, with- </p><p>draw until they had lost themselves in the </p><p>shadows under the overhanging cliffs. </p><p> “If he means business,” wondered North-</p><p>rup, “why doesn’t he make the fight as they </p><p>come up the cliffs? The way Tiyo went for </p><p>him? Or has his nerve left him, after all?” </p><p>Now, standing upon the cliff’s edge where </p><p>all above and below might see them, were </p><p>three forms, that of a white-clad maiden, </p><p>her face radiant, a strange brightness in her </p><p>eyes, the form of Strang close to her at her </p><p>left, Northrup upon her right, a dozen steps </p><p>away. Then there was old Inaa, standing </p><p>between Northrup and Yahoya, then Tiyo </p><p>a little back, his eyes like hard, cold stones </p><p>upon Strang. The others who had followed </p><p>until now remained a score of steps from </p><p>the precipice where they were not to be </p><p>seen from below. </p><p> “Now the show-down,” grunted North-</p><p>rup to himself. “It’s Strang against Tiyo. </p><p>Who wins?” </p><p> Inaa slowly lifted his hand. The shout-</p><p>ing ceased below; again the leaping forms </p><p>grew still save for a little swaying. It </p><p>seemed to Northrup, however, that they </p><p>were vaguely restless, eager for the happen- </p><p>ing of something at which he could only </p><p>guess. Was it merely the marriage cere- </p><p>mony? Or were there many men down </p><p>there waiting a signal to take sides, some </p><p>with Strang, some with Inaa and Tiyo? </p><p> “Look, People of the Hidden Spring!”</p><p>cried Inaa suddenly, his voice floating out </p><p>wildly, his two arms wide-flung. “See how </p><p>Inaa has kept you from under the heel of </p><p>the world of Bahanas! How many have </p><p>Yahoya </p><p>37 </p><p>come here in the memory of grown men? </p><p>Two—no more. How many have gone </p><p>away again, to tell of what they have seen </p><p>here? None! Has not Inaa guarded you </p><p>well? Look before the light comes; see </p><p>where, across the desert, the eyes of Inaa </p><p>are watching!” </p><p> Then Northrup, looking out the way the</p><p>old man pointed across the wide sweep of </p><p>desert to the south, saw a great pillar of </p><p>flame standing red against the pale sky. It </p><p>shot upward from the distant mountain- </p><p>peaks, and he knew that at the least those </p><p>peaks were fifty miles away! </p><p> He looked to the eastward and saw again</p><p>a pillar of red fire lapping at the skies and </p><p>knew that it was little closer than the first. </p><p>He looked to the west and saw the third. </p><p>And suddenly, as he remembered the old </p><p>Indian woman who had kept him alive, he </p><p>thought that there was less madness than </p><p>sanity in the things she had told him. </p><p> Was she one of the outposts of this</p><p>strange people, after all? Had her fires shot </p><p>their swift messages here that Inaa might </p><p>know if all were well? Had the blaze his </p><p>own hands had kindled before her dying </p><p>eyes spoken to Inaa, too? Were there seven </p><p>citics of Chebo, as she had told; was this </p><p>people but the first of them? Had the old </p><p>Spanish adventurers but told the truth af- </p><p>ter all of the wonderful cities of Cibola; and </p><p>had they remained all these years hidden </p><p>from the white man? He felt his blood tin- </p><p>gling through him. </p><p> He looked to the north. Here the cliffs</p><p>stood up so that one might not look far out </p><p>as in the other directions. But here, clear- </p><p>ly outlined against the sky, was the form </p><p>of a man. And the man was shouting, his </p><p>voice coming down clearly: </p><p> “In the north all is well, Father! The fire</p><p>burns red!” </p><p> Again the people below shouted, crying:</p><p> “The red fires burn! It is well!”</p><p> And again they fell silent abruptly.</p><p> “Inaa has guarded his children well,”</p><p>went on the priest solemnly. “For fifty </p><p>years has he not been Inguu and Inaa </p><p>(mother and father) to you? Because the </p><p>gods were pleased did they not send one of </p><p>their kind, the Goddess Yahoya, to live </p><p>with you? Did they not send the Bahana </p><p>whom you call the Man of Wisdom to cure </p><p>the sick and teach you how to make better </p><p>things from gold—beautiful things for you </p><p>to wear, cups from which to drink? And </p><p>has not Inaa kept the Bahana here so that </p><p>he might not go out to tell of what he has </p><p>seen and so bring the cursed white men </p><p>here, as they have gone everywhere else </p><p>over the world?” </p><p> A moment he was silent. Then, his voice</p><p>lowered a little, he continued: </p><p> “Inaa is old, his years weigh him down.</p><p>Yahoya this night, her heart opened to the </p><p>future, has said that already is the Skele- </p><p>ton House made ready for the coming of </p><p>Inaa. But he does not go and leave his </p><p>people without a thought for their welfare. </p><p>He leaves behind him one to step into his </p><p>place, the biggest man among you, the </p><p>mightiest with his hands, the swiftest run- </p><p>ner across the desert, the most tireless, </p><p>Tiyo, the head captain of your young men!” </p><p>A great shout swept up from below: </p><p>“Tiyo! Tiyo! Tiyo!” </p><p> And then, as silence was settling, a loud</p><p>voice boomed out: </p><p> “Tiyo for our Head Man; Yahoya for</p><p>our Goddess! Tiyo and Yahoya!” And </p><p>again many voices arose crying, “Tiyo and </p><p>Yahoya!” </p><p> Tiyo himself, at a sharp glance from the</p><p>old man, came forward another step, swift- </p><p>ly, standing very close to Yahoya, so close </p><p>that her gown brushed him. The cheering </p><p>rose more windily from below. Strang’s </p><p>eyes and Tiyo’s met then. To Northrup it </p><p>was a sheer wonder that the two men could </p><p>hold themselves back from flying at each </p><p>other’s throats. </p><p> While they shouted down there Inaa was</p><p>speaking swiftly with Yahoya. Northrup </p><p>could not catch the words, but words were </p><p>not needed now to tell what Inaa was say- </p><p>ing. He was commanding, urging, threat- </p><p>ening. And when Yahoya answered, it</p><p>seemed that she had given him an answer </p><p>that pleased him. </p><p> “Listen, my children,” cried Inaa, his</p><p>voice ringing with the triumph in it. “The </p><p>White Goddess is pleased with you this </p><p>dawning. Her heart is yours. It is not her </p><p>wish to journey back up through the skies </p><p>down which she came; it is not her wish to </p><p>move on down into the uncterworld where </p><p>the abode of the gods is. She will linger </p><p>here with you, she will wed Tiyo and you </p><p>shall be their children, blessed of the gods!” </p><p>Northrup could see that Yahoya was </p><p>smiling. She leaned out over the abyss un- </p><p>til he was afraid for her, thinking that mad- </p><p>ness had come upon her and that she was </p><p>38 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>going to fall. She lifted her hand and there </p><p>fell the great silence again, seeming now </p><p>more breathless than ever. And then, when </p><p>everything was still, when they waited and </p><p>wondered why she did not speak, suddenly </p><p>she broke the silence. And not with a </p><p>spoken word, but with a clear burst of </p><p>laughter leaping out over them from her </p><p>red lips. </p><p> Inaa frowned and plucked at his beard;</p><p>Tiyo shifted his feet, looking uncertainly </p><p>from his father to Yahoya; Strang stared </p><p>at her much as Northrup was staring. And </p><p>still, until she had done, Yahoya gave free </p><p>vent to her tinkling laughter. </p><p> “You have heard Inaa,” she cried at last,</p><p>her voice clear and steady, confident and </p><p>imperious. “Now hear Yahoya! Do I look </p><p>to you like one afraid? Do I tremble as if </p><p>with fear? Does my body shake as men’s </p><p>bodies do when they look on death? And </p><p>yet have I been threatened tonight! Alik- </p><p>sai. Listen. </p><p> “It is the dawning and Yahoya, the God-</p><p>dess, has said that she would wed. Whom </p><p>would you have her take for husband, my </p><p>People of the Hidden Spring? Shall it be </p><p>Tiyo here? He is hungry for me; he is </p><p>shaking with the desire for me; Inaa bids </p><p>me marry him! Shall it be the Man of Wis- </p><p>dom? He is covetous of beautiful things </p><p>and he wants Yahoya! His eyes burn me </p><p>with the greed in them. Shall I take him </p><p>for husband? </p><p> “Are you not my people, O People of the</p><p>Hidden Spring? Shall not your wish enter </p><p>the heart of the White Goddess? Cry out </p><p>in a loud voice and say whom shall Yaho- </p><p>ya wed?” </p><p> Northrup moved closer without knowing</p><p>that he did so, thrilled with the girl’s fear- </p><p>lessness. He had heard her words to Strang, </p><p>he had seen her seem to agree with Inaa. </p><p>What was she going to do? </p><p> She herself had given the sign for divi-</p><p>sion. In the shouting which answered her </p><p>there were many voices clamoring for Tiyo, </p><p>many for Strang. And as by magic the </p><p>throng about the fires was shaken into its</p><p>two factions, women drawing back, men </p><p>grouping here and yonder about their lead- </p><p>ers. </p><p> “Wait!” Yahoya’s clear young voice cut</p><p>through the din like a bell through a roll of </p><p>thunder. “Wait and listen! The Man of </p><p>Wisdom has said to me: ‘Will you wed </p><p>me?’ And Yahoya, the Goddess, promised! </p><p>Inaa has said to me, ‘Will you wed Tiyo </p><p>my son?’ And Yahoya told him, ‘I have </p><p>promised and a goddess may not break her </p><p>word!’ What is the answer, my people?” </p><p> Only a murmur crept up to her in an-</p><p>swer. Men looked at her wonderingly, wait- </p><p>ing and listening as she had commanded. </p><p>And again she laughed. </p><p> “Yahoya will tell you,” she cried lightly,</p><p>her rising voice seeming to soar upward </p><p>upon wings of happiness. “Yahoya, the </p><p>goddess, may not lie. But what maiden </p><p>among you would not lie for her lover? </p><p>Yahoya, who is no goddess but a white </p><p>maid, will not wed with Tiyo. And she will </p><p>not wed with Strang, who is a coward. She </p><p>chooses her Own lover, and if it be death— </p><p>why then, she chooses death with him.” </p><p> Like a flash she had fled along the cliff-</p><p>edge, sweeping by Tiyo, avoiding Inaa’s </p><p>clutching fingers. She had sped to North- </p><p>rup’s side and her arms flashed upward and </p><p>about his shoulders. </p><p> “Save me from them, Saxnorthrup!” she</p><p>whispered. “I am only a maid—and I am </p><p>afraid!” </p><p> As Northrup stared down at the face at</p><p>his breast, he felt the wild flutter of her </p><p>heart against him and heard her whisper- </p><p>ing: </p><p> “Of you only am I not afraid—because I</p><p>love you, Saxnorthrup!” </p><p>XII </p><p>ONLY a little while ago Northrup </p><p>himself had said: “Love does not </p><p>come like this, in a hurry!” And </p><p>now he knew in a flash that then he had </p><p>known nothing of it: that love comes as it </p><p>wills, without man’s bidding or consent. </p><p>And, madness though it might be, it had</p><p>come to him. </p><p> As his arms shut about her, hurting her</p><p>in that first embrace, his heart was beating </p><p>as wildly as hers. He wanted her; she be- </p><p>longed to him; and he was going to have </p><p>her! </p><p> He wanted to get her away from here and</p><p>to make her happy; he wanted to show her </p><p>a world which would be like fairyland to </p><p>her; he wanted to teach her his language, </p><p>her own forgotten tongue; he wanted to </p><p>mother her and father her and lover her. </p><p>She was at once to him both an incompar- </p><p>able maiden and a little, frightened, hunted </p><p>wild thing. </p><p>Yahoya </p><p>39 </p><p> But while something deep within him,</p><p>until now unawakened, talked to his soul of </p><p>these things, his eyes and brain were keenly </p><p>alive to what lay about him. The thing </p><p>which he read in Strang’s eyes was little dif- </p><p>ferent from the thing he saw in the eyes of </p><p>Tiyo and Inaa. Amazement first, then in- </p><p>credulity which was still half stupefaction, </p><p>then baffled rage and open threat. </p><p> Northrup’s thought just then was that it</p><p>was going to end with him and Yahoya go- </p><p>ing over the cliff together. And yet, in </p><p>that first wild moment, it was only elation </p><p>which beat through his heart. She lifted </p><p>her head a little, looking straight up into </p><p>his eyes. And there before them all, not to </p><p>be robbed of what life seemed to be bring- </p><p>ing them at its close, he kissed her. </p><p> “You love me, Saxnorthrup?” the girl</p><p>whispered. </p><p> “I love you, Yahoya,” he told her.</p><p> It was Inaa wjio took the first step for-</p><p>ward. Yahoya, seeing him coming, slipped </p><p>quickly from Northrup’s arms. She alone </p><p>had been in a position to plan for all things </p><p>since she alone knew what Yahoya was go- </p><p>ing to do. She cried out clearly, sending </p><p>her voice downward, calling: </p><p> “Will you hear Yahoya speak, my peo-</p><p>ple? Will you bid Inaa stand back while </p><p>Yahoya speaks?” </p><p> There came quick answer to her, many</p><p>voices shouting: </p><p> “Yahoya! Listen to Yahoya!”</p><p> Down below, the two distinct factions</p><p>now stood fully separated, grouped upon </p><p>opposite sides of the fires. Clearly they </p><p>were nearly equal in numbers; clearly then </p><p>half of the men down there hungered to see </p><p>Inaa and Tiyo fail in their wishes; while the </p><p>other half clung to the old order and stood </p><p>ready to oppose Strang’s party in all </p><p>things. </p><p> “There is our one chance,” muttered</p><p>Northrup, ready for whatever might hap- </p><p>pen; and he waited anxiously for Yahoya</p><p>to speak. </p><p> Inaa, too, waited, and Tiyo and Strang,</p><p>each for the moment uncertain. Yahoya, </p><p>with a swift glance at them, turned again </p><p>toward the expectant tribe. </p><p> “Among you,” she cried, “are many</p><p>young men and maidens. What man of </p><p>you will stand aside and see another take </p><p>his mana? What maiden of you will let </p><p>Inaa or another tell her which lover she </p><p>must love? You can look into Yahoya’s </p><p>heart and into Yellow Beard’s heart and </p><p>understand! </p><p> “But listen further! Many of you, drawn</p><p>off there against the cliffs, have your hearts </p><p>filled with hatred of Inaa and Tiyo! Over </p><p>there stand you others, and your hearts are </p><p>filled with hatred of the Man of Wisdom. </p><p>Across the space between you your eyes run </p><p>like the eyes of wolves hungering. </p><p> “The People of the Hidden Spring love</p><p>their cornfields and their homes and their </p><p>quiet lives of security. And yet, even now, </p><p>they are about to spring upon one another </p><p>to send many souls down to the Skeleton </p><p>House, to tear themselves in two. Is it </p><p>wise? Or has magic fallen upon you? Mag- </p><p>ic from the Man of Wisdom or from Inaa </p><p>himself? </p><p> “If I wed Tiyo there will be war. If I</p><p>wed the Man of Wisdom there will be war. </p><p>What say you, my people, if Yahoya weds </p><p>neither of them, but the man of her own </p><p>choice, the great Yellow Beard? Then to- </p><p>night you will not spill your blood and your </p><p>brother’s, but instead you will drink deep, </p><p>feast full and sleep in peace! Now you can </p><p>command Inaa to wed me to Yellow Beard </p><p>and so, those of you who hate Tiyo can </p><p>laugh at him; those of you who hate the </p><p>Man of Wisdom can laugh at him! </p><p> “Aliksail Listen. One way you shall</p><p>have Yahoya’s death and Yellow Beard’s, </p><p>for they will go down over the cliffs to- </p><p>gether; you will have Inaa’s death and </p><p>Tiyo’s and Strang’s and Muyingwa’s, and </p><p>the deaths of many young men, the strong- </p><p>est in the tribe, for they will fall! Another </p><p>way and you will have peace. And tomor- </p><p>row you can have your election if you like, </p><p>keeping Inaa where he is or putting another</p><p>in his place. What say you, my people?” </p><p> She drew back a little, not so far as to be</p><p>lost from their sight, just so that she could </p><p>stretch out her hand and slip it into North- </p><p>rup’s. Inaa began shouting; Tiyo’s voice </p><p>joined his angrily; Strang, stepping for- </p><p>ward, called with them. And from below, </p><p>out of a little silence, came a great shout of </p><p>laughter! </p><p> “Let us drink, brothers!” cried a loud</p><p>voice. “We were bewitched. The maid is </p><p>right. Why should we fight when it is eas- </p><p>ier to drink and eat, to dance and sleep? </p><p>Inaa had promised us a wedding; let him </p><p>marry the maid to Yellow Beard!” </p><p> Now many shouted one thing, many an-</p><p>other. But again and again a grumble of </p><p>4o </p><p>Adventure </p><p>dissatisfaction was drowned in a shout of </p><p>laughter. In the main the faction hating </p><p>Tiyo was satisfied to see him thrust aside </p><p>for another; those hating Strang were sat- </p><p>isfied in his discomfiture. </p><p> The Hopi are at heart peace-loving peo-</p><p>ple; a dance and a feast appeal to them far </p><p>more than an orgy of blood. Here was at </p><p>once a compromise and a huge joke on their </p><p>head men. And perhaps many lovers below </p><p>felt their rude sympathy for the lovers above. </p><p> Tiyo’s twenty men, drawing closer now,</p><p>looked at one another a trifle uncertainly. </p><p>They began speaking in low tones and </p><p>Northrup heard one of them laugh. The </p><p>half-dozen men Strang had left in the shad- </p><p>ows had been joined secretly by several </p><p>others; they too had drawn closer and were </p><p>speaking among themselves. </p><p> Looking to them Northrup saw a quick</p><p>figure flit out of Yahoya’s stone building </p><p>and run toward them. It was the girl, Na- </p><p>yangap. She went hastily to the side of </p><p>the young man, Muyingwa, and began </p><p>speaking to him earnestly. And Muying- </p><p>wa, nodding, came on until he stood close </p><p>to Yahoya’s side. Strang stared at him </p><p>anxiously. </p><p> “Aliksai. Listen!” he cried loudly, until</p><p>the din below grew still. “It is I, Muying- </p><p>wa, who speak. Inaa has said that it is </p><p>Tiyo who is the strongest of us, the swift- </p><p>est runner. He lies! Even now will I run </p><p>out across the desert with Tiyo, as many </p><p>miles as he will and come back ahead of </p><p>him! The men who are my men know this </p><p>and have no love for liars! So they would </p><p>not see Yahoya wedded to one of them. </p><p>But with Yellow Beard it is different. Let </p><p>Inaa wed them and we shall throw down </p><p>our arms and feast. Then I will race with </p><p>Tiyo, and the man who is strongest and </p><p>swiftest will be your head captain. Then </p><p>you will vote for Inaa or the other as your </p><p>head priest. What say you? Is not Yaho- </p><p>ya right? What man of us loves Tiyo or the </p><p>Man of Wisdom better than his own life?” </p><p> While those bent upon strife murmured</p><p>everywhere, those who had gone into the </p><p>division half-heartedly or not at all, out-</p><p>numbered them many to one. When, after </p><p>that, Inaa sought to make himself heard, no </p><p>one would listen; when Tiyo shouted, his </p><p>words were lost to the ears of those stand- </p><p>ing close to him; when Strang shot out a </p><p>sharp word and an evil glance at Muying- </p><p>wa, it was met with a hard stare. Muying- </p><p>wa had gone back to his mana, and the two </p><p>of them were standing like Northrup and </p><p>Yahoya, hand in hand. </p><p> It was perhaps Muyingwa’s offer to race</p><p>with Tiyo as much as anything which set- </p><p>tled the matter. There are no runners in </p><p>the world like the runners of the southwest- </p><p>ern desert; they are men who can run an </p><p>unbelievable number of miles out across </p><p>blazing sands in the morning to dig in their </p><p>fields and run back the same evening. With </p><p>them running is at once a necessary thing, </p><p>a part of their religious training, and a way </p><p>of settling just such debates as the one that </p><p>had arisen now. </p><p> They began sweeping up along the steep</p><p>steps now, the men of the two factions min- </p><p>gling, jostling one another, each eager to be </p><p>the first to come to the top. Northrup </p><p>pressed Yahoya’s hand mightily. </p><p> “You are a God-blessed wonder, Yaho-</p><p>ya,” he whispered. “We are going to pull </p><p>through.” </p><p> “You hurt my hand, Saxnorthrup!” she</p><p>smiled up at him. “But—do it again!” </p><p>SOON they were in the center of a </p><p>great ring, they with Inaa, Strang </p><p>and Tiyo. Men were laughing open- </p><p>ly everywhere. And their eyes, when they </p><p>had finished with Yahoya and Northrup, </p><p>had already measured Tiyo and were seek- </p><p>ing to measure Muyingwa that they might </p><p>lay their wagers upon the endurance run. </p><p> A man is not head priest of such a peo-</p><p>ple as this for fifty years without learning </p><p>something. There was not a cooler, craftier </p><p>mind among them than Inaa’s. He knew </p><p>full well that in time of storm the reed that </p><p>bends is better off than the stubborn tree. </p><p>He frowned warningly at Tiyo, then, mak- </p><p>ing his face over into its habitual mask, </p><p>turned to Yahoya. </p><p> “Yahoya has been pleased,” he said</p><p>steadily, “to test her people. She has de- </p><p>clared herself no true goddess but a mere </p><p>maid to see if in our hearts’ fear of the god- </p><p>dess were greater than love of Yahoya! </p><p>Her will is the will of her people. The dawn </p><p>has come and a wedding is promised. Let </p><p>Yahoya and the great Bahana come for- </p><p>ward.” </p><p> Northrup, looking down quickly at Ya-</p><p>hoya saw that her dimples had come back, </p><p>that her eyes were shining softly, that a </p><p>happy flush had run up into her cheeks. </p><p>What wonderful thing was this? Had it </p><p>Yahoya </p><p>41 </p><p>been just a few hours since he had come </p><p>here, dying of thirst? Or had it been years? </p><p>Was he, Sax Northrup, about to be joined </p><p>to this radiant girl in matrimony, none the </p><p>less holy to him because of the heathen rites </p><p>with which it was to be celebrated? Or </p><p>was he dreaming the whole mad thing? </p><p> Slowly, his hand holding hers, he and</p><p>Yahoya stepped forward. And then a sud- </p><p>den dread came upon him. If it had come </p><p>to open fight it would have been one thing, </p><p>a thing Northrup knew. But now that no </p><p>knife-blade caught the early light he knew </p><p>that none the less there were knives hun- </p><p>gering for him, perhaps for Yahoya. He </p><p>felt that all about him was menace, the </p><p>more terrible because it was glossed over </p><p>with smiles—a concealed, masked danger. </p><p> But these things he promptly forgot.</p><p>Inaa, fighting hard for the mastery of him- </p><p>self, and getting it wonderfully, gave the </p><p>people what they demanded, a wedding. </p><p>Northrup, looking down at Yahoya’s up- </p><p>turned face, saw a great, unfeigned gladness </p><p>there. Her lips moved silently with Inaa’s, </p><p>as if she knew each word of the ceremony </p><p>and were saying it within her heart. </p><p> Northrup did not know if he were doing</p><p>a good or a bad thing in letting this go on; </p><p>he only knew that he loved Yahoya and </p><p>that she thought that she loved him. And </p><p>there was no time for thought. Already he </p><p>heard Inaa’s words, saw Yahoya forming </p><p>them silently. </p><p> “The Spider Woman and the Great Earth</p><p>Woman, the goddess who weaves the colors </p><p>of sunrise and sunset, the goddess to whom </p><p>belongs the world, the god who makes </p><p>green things grow and the God of Rain, the </p><p>great gods and the small gods bless you, </p><p>Yahoya and Yellow Beard! You are a mana </p><p>and his woman. The woman’s house is </p><p>open to the man, to none but him. It is done! ’ ’ </p><p> And between two long lines, instantly</p><p>formed, of shouting, laughing men, Sax </p><p>Northrup and his wife, given to him by her </p><p>own will and by the head priest of the Peo- </p><p>ple of the Hidden Spring, passed into the </p><p>stone house. </p><p>XIII </p><p>“WE ARE married, Saxnorthrup! </p><p>Is it not nice to be married to </p><p>Yahoya?” </p><p> She came into his arms like a bird to its</p><p>nest, fluttering a little, eager to be there. </p><p> “You are my man!” she whispered. “And</p><p>I am your manaI Oh, but I am proud of </p><p>you, Saxnorthrup! There is no other man </p><p>like you in the world! Did I not see you lift </p><p>up Tiyo and cast him down so that his </p><p>bones ached? Did I not see you strike </p><p>Eddie mightily so that he reeled back </p><p>afraid? I am glad you are no god, but a </p><p>man, Saxnorthrup. Glad that I am no god- </p><p>dess, but a maid to love as other maids love </p><p>—but harder!” </p><p> Outside, the last of the procession had</p><p>passed by, the shouting forms had gone </p><p>down the stairway; men were forgetting </p><p>them in their eagerness for a test of strength </p><p>and speed between Tiyo and Muyingwa. </p><p> Northrup drew the girl tenderly to him,</p><p>a little sense of awe upon him now that they </p><p>were alone together, a little sense of pity </p><p>for her, a feeling that though Inaa had </p><p>given her to him, and the tribe had cheered, </p><p>all was not well. They were forgotten for </p><p>the moment. But Northrup had not </p><p>missed the look in Strang’s eyes, in Inaa’s, </p><p>in Tiyo’s, as they had passed the open door </p><p>and gone on. </p><p> “Yahoya,” he said gently, “I love you.</p><p>Things have a way of happening which I </p><p>had not expected. I didn’t know just what </p><p>love was, and now I know. I didn’t believe </p><p>in it overmuch, I suppose; and now I know </p><p>that there is nothing else in the world this </p><p>morning that counts. If a man looks at you </p><p>I want to murder him. I am going to try </p><p>to take you away with me, Yahoya, where </p><p>you will see other men, better men to look </p><p>upon than I am. I am going to play square, </p><p>if I can. And if you find you don’t love me </p><p>after all, that you do love some other man, </p><p>then-” </p><p> “Then, Saxnorthrup?” she asked softly.</p><p>“I think I’d kill the brute!” said Northrup </p><p>savagely. </p><p> Whereupon Yahoya was vastly delighted.</p><p>“You do love me,” she told him sagely. </p><p>“For I feel like that! And,” eagerly, “you’ll </p><p>take me into the world of the Bahanas? So </p><p>that I shall see the wagons running uphill </p><p>without horses? And great houses that </p><p>float on the water? And many, many won- </p><p>derful things?” </p><p> Could he do these things? Could he one</p><p>day take Yahoya to her first opera? Could </p><p>he take her to marvel at the great spectacu- </p><p>lar shows of the great cities? Could he be </p><p>the first to initiate her into a life which </p><p>would be a veritable wonderland to her? </p><p>42 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Had his destiny saved this one glorious thing </p><p>for him to do? Would ever any one in all </p><p>the world have been so equipped as was </p><p>Yahoya for enjoyment, for marveling from </p><p>day to day, from night to night? </p><p> He could imagine her little cry of ecstasy</p><p>when they drove down Broadway the first </p><p>night, when she saw the lights, the many- </p><p>colored electric displays above. To her it </p><p>would be magic. The train upon which </p><p>they traveled, the women’s gowns, the por- </p><p>ters in their uniforms, books and pictures </p><p>and music; dainty things to eat—why, an </p><p>ice-cream would be a thing of wonder to </p><p>her. Could he, Sax Northrup, take this </p><p>maid by the hand and lead her out into the </p><p>new world? </p><p> He remembered Strang’s look, Tiyo’s and</p><p>Inaa’s, and his brows contracted. Yahoya </p><p>looked at him wonderingly. </p><p> “What is it, Saxnorthrup?” she asked un-</p><p>certainly. “I have displeased you?” </p><p> He laughed at her, drew her even closer</p><p>to him, kissing the alarmed look out of her </p><p>eyes. </p><p> “I was just thinking, my little wild girl,”</p><p>he told her gaily. “Thinking makes a man’s </p><p>face look like that. I won’t do it any more.” </p><p>So much, loverwise. Then, man-like, he </p><p>began thinking seriously again. Here was </p><p>the situation: </p><p> He had come here, led by the lure of gold.</p><p>If he got out at all it seemed that he would </p><p>go as empty-pocketed as he had come. He </p><p>thought disparagingly of the thousand dol- </p><p>lars he had outside in a bank. He didn’t </p><p>know much about the cost of women’s gar- </p><p>ments, but he had the hazy idea that the </p><p>sort of gown he wanted Yahoya to wear </p><p>would cost the greater part of his thousand. </p><p>And then, how was he going to take her </p><p>everywhere in the world, give her every- </p><p>thing she would be| sure to want? She’d be </p><p>asking for a hundred things every minute </p><p>at first. </p><p> So much for the money end of it. There</p><p>was still left the greater question— </p><p> “Can we get out at all?”</p><p> It was almost as if she had read some of</p><p>his thoughts. She had slipped away from </p><p>him, running to the door of one of the ante- </p><p>rooms. Holding aside the curtain there, she </p><p>said happily, </p><p> “This is Yahoya’s sleeping-room. Will</p><p>you see how pretty it is, Saxnorthrup? And </p><p>the pretty things her people gave her as </p><p>gifts to the goddess?” </p><p> He hesitated at the door a moment, un-</p><p>certain if he should profane it with his pres- </p><p>ence. It drew from him a little gasp of ad- </p><p>miration and amazement. </p><p> There was a couch made cozy with the</p><p>skins thrown over it. A table, cunningly </p><p>made of wood so precious here, stood out </p><p>in the center of the little room, a square of </p><p>snow-white buckskin thrown over it. Upon </p><p>the table was a vase with pale-blue flowers. , </p><p>And the vase itself was of solid gold, skil- </p><p>fully hammered. </p><p> Upon the floor, arranged about the walls,</p><p>were countless cups and vases, tiny jugs, </p><p>belts, forehead bands, moccasin ornaments, </p><p>jeweled bracelets—all of solid gold, many </p><p>set with flawless turquoises. </p><p> “All presents to Yahoya,” she smiled at</p><p>him. “You see, Saxnorthrup, Yahoya was </p><p>a goddess and a great lady before she gave </p><p>herself away to you! And presently, after </p><p>Tiyo and Muyingwa race, there will be more </p><p>presents. For me, the bride, and for you, </p><p>the bridegroom, Saxnorthrup.” </p><p> She made herself comfortable upon one</p><p>end of her couch, drew up her feet under her, </p><p>gathered her knees into her arms and dim- </p><p>pled over them at Northrup. </p><p> “No wonder Strang counts himself a mil-</p><p>lionaire,” thought Northrup. “And small </p><p>chance that he will let us get away if he </p><p>knows the way to stop us.” </p><p> And to Yahoya he said slowly:</p><p> “Do you know—Mrs. Sax Northrup—”</p><p>she laughed delightedly and blushed be- </p><p>comingly at the new name which she inter- </p><p>rupted him by saying over softly to herself </p><p>—“you are a disgracefully rich young</p><p>woman?” </p><p> “Oh,” she laughed, “this is nothing! In</p><p>each of the Seven Cities Yahoya has a </p><p>house-” </p><p> “Seven Cities!” broke in Northrup quick-</p><p>ly. “What Seven Cities, Yahoya?” </p><p> She lifted her brows at him in surprise.</p><p>“You do not know then? This is but one </p><p>of the Seven Cities of Chebo, the smallest, </p><p>where Yahoya has come but seldom for </p><p>the Festival of Silence. The others have </p><p>many people and big houses in the cliffs, </p><p>with wide stairways up and down, and hun- </p><p>dreds of rooms. And in each is a great </p><p>house with five, six, nine rooms, all belong- </p><p>ing to Yahoya. Here I bring but two maids; </p><p>there I have many to dress my hair, to </p><p>bathe me, to do little things for me that I </p><p>do not wish to do. There I have many golden </p><p>Yahoya </p><p>43 </p><p>things: a table all of gold, with many </p><p>turquoises; a little bed with golden feet; </p><p>white furs to walk on; a chair to ride in, </p><p>heavy with gold, that strong men carry. </p><p>You shall see, Saxnorthrup! And you shall </p><p>know that Yahoya does not come to her </p><p>lover with empty hands!” </p><p> Nayangap and Tocha came in to serve</p><p>them a breakfast of milk and little corn-meal </p><p>cakes in Yahoya’s room, and until they had </p><p>gone, taking their trays away with them, </p><p>Northrup listened eagerly to what Ya- </p><p>hoya had to tell him. And, in brief, this is </p><p>what he learned: </p><p> The Seven Cities of Chebo controlled a</p><p>district, perhaps two hundred miles across. </p><p>There were rich valleys, hidden in the </p><p>mountains, where they grew their melons </p><p>and corn and cotton. There were mines </p><p>from which they took vast quantities of gold </p><p>and silver, fashioning ornaments and table </p><p>sendee for the rich. </p><p> A young man was overlord of the Seven</p><p>Cities, having been elected to hold office </p><p>for life. He had turned his eyes upon </p><p>Yahoya, but since he had already tw'o </p><p>wives, the priests, very powerful through- </p><p>out the district, had forbidden him wed- </p><p>ding her. </p><p> In order that white men might not come</p><p>into a country which nature had so cun- </p><p>ningly hidden from them, there were sta- </p><p>tioned out through the desert, upon any of </p><p>the water-trails, sentinels who signaled by </p><p>fire or smoke when a man came into sight. </p><p>Generally these were the older folk, men </p><p>and women, useless to the state for other </p><p>purposes, who believed that thus they </p><p>would be pleasing their gods, and who con- </p><p>sidered it a high honor to be chosen for so </p><p>responsible a task. </p><p> So if a white man had turned toward the</p><p>Seven Cities, he might not come within </p><p>fifty miles of the nearest of them when he </p><p>was met by runners sent out to intercept </p><p>him. A friendly greeting, a sharp knife </p><p>from the back, and one more name stricken </p><p>from the list of adventurers. Or, if men </p><p>were needed in the mines, a living death. </p><p>Besides the outposts, there were lookouts</p><p>upon the cliff-tops, alert, keen-eyed men, </p><p>who did not miss the slinking form of a </p><p>gray coyote upon the gray sands. </p><p> Northrup thought swiftly of the sand-</p><p>storm, of his lying so long blotted out from </p><p>sight against the drifting sand; of how when </p><p>he had at last come on, it was night, and the </p><p>lookouts had perhaps come down to take </p><p>part in the Festival of Silence. </p><p> “If you did not know of the Seven Cit-</p><p>ies,” Yahoya asked him, “how is it that </p><p>you came journeying this way, Saxnorth- </p><p>rup?” </p><p> He began telling her of the Indian in</p><p>Santa Fe, only to be interrupted by Yahoya </p><p>saying quickly— </p><p> “You were with Eddie then, when the</p><p>runner died?” </p><p> “Yes. Strang has told you about that?”</p><p>“No,” she answered. “He always lied to </p><p>me, not knowing that I knew he lied. He </p><p>said that in his heart he dreamed a dream </p><p>of me, and that that brought him across the </p><p>sands, hurrying!” </p><p> Northrup grunted. Then, moved to</p><p>curiosity he demanded— </p><p> “If Strang didn’t tell you of it, how do</p><p>you know?” </p><p> “Tiyo told me,” she answered, puzzling</p><p>him still more. </p><p> “Tiyo? Who told Tiyo?”</p><p> “He was there. It was Tiyo who shot</p><p>the poisoned arrow in at the window.” </p><p>“Tiyo went way down to Santa Fe, killed </p><p>his man, and came back here?” </p><p> She nodded.</p><p> “The other was Chiwakala, son of the</p><p>old man that Strang would make head </p><p>priest in the place of Inaa. Chiwakala was </p><p>a friend of Kish-taka, the Hawk Man, who </p><p>is overlord of the Seven Cities, and not with- </p><p>out power himself. Between him and Tiyo </p><p>there has always been rivalry and hatred. </p><p>Kish-taka sought to make him head captain </p><p>of the youths of the Hidden Spring. But</p><p>even Kish-taka’s power was less in this </p><p>matter than Inaa’s, and so Tiyo was </p><p>elected. </p><p> “Chiwakala was bad in his heart, nuk-</p><p>pana. People said he was a Powaka, who </p><p>casts evil and sickness into men. It was </p><p>Tiyo’s doing that Chiwakala was con- </p><p>demned to spend all his life down in a mine </p><p>where bad men and women are put, and </p><p>those that Kish-taka or the priests do not </p><p>like. Then Chiwakala, who was a great </p><p>runner like Tiyo and Muyingwa, fled, hav- </p><p>ing in his heart to go out among the Bahana </p><p>and, because he hated Tiyo and others, to </p><p>send certain of the Bahanas into our land, </p><p>telling them of riches to be had. </p><p> “Chiwakala went swiftly, but Tiyo went</p><p>after him, also swiftly. Chiwakala, coming </p><p>first among the Bahanas, had told his story, </p><p>44 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>and men laughed at him, calling him liar. </p><p>Then, in Santa Fe, he was to tell a man who </p><p>is known among the Bahanas as a hardy </p><p>adventurer. There Tiyo came up with him, </p><p>and, shooting quickly through the open </p><p>window a little blue-winged arrow with </p><p>poison tip, killed him. Then Tiyo came </p><p>back, and even Kish-taka, who had be- </p><p>friended Chiwakala, said that he had been </p><p>nukpana, and that Tiyo had done well for </p><p>the people of the Seven Cities.” </p><p> From Santa Fe, Northrup estimated</p><p>roughly that he had traversed some four </p><p>hundred miles in coming here. A round </p><p>trip of eight hundred miles! And yet Ya- </p><p>hoya spoke of the matter lightly, as if Tiyo </p><p>had run but a little way. </p><p> “How long was Tiyo gone?” he asked cu-</p><p>riously. </p><p> “From the moonrise when he departed</p><p>until the dawning when he dropped down </p><p>before me,” she answered, “twenty days had </p><p>passed!” </p><p> “Twenty days!” gasped Northrup.</p><p> “Oh,” she said quickly, misunderstanding</p><p>his thought, “it was because he lost time in </p><p>seeking out Chiwakala among the white </p><p>men. Tiyo would have come back sooner </p><p>but for that.” </p><p> Eight hundred miles in twenty days!</p><p>And Yahoya was apologizing for Tiyo’s </p><p>slowness! A clip of over forty miles a day, </p><p>day in and day out, over such country as </p><p>Northrup knew stretched between these </p><p>people and Santa Fe! It was incredible— </p><p>and yet it was the sober truth. For here </p><p>are a people not like other men, a people </p><p>with a strange, seemingly tireless power and </p><p>swiftness, that is the result of desert train- </p><p>ing, inheritance, evolution, all aided by the </p><p>religious ceremonies calling for an abnor- </p><p>mally developed physique. The desert had </p><p>made creatures like the coyote, the snake, </p><p>the jackrabbit that knew how to live a very </p><p>long time without water. The desert had </p><p>made its own plant life to exist and flourish </p><p>where water was not. The desert had made </p><p>its men. </p><p> Even now that a great issue held in bal-</p><p>ance, that issue was to be decided by such </p><p>a race as perhaps no white man had ever </p><p>seen. Tiyo and Muyingwa, down in the </p><p>canon were ready. </p><p> “Shall we go out upon the cliff edge and</p><p>watch them?” said Northrup. “I think </p><p>that very much depends on this race—for </p><p>you and me, Yahoya!” </p><p> XIV</p><p>TIYO and Muyingwa showed an </p><p>equal eagerness to be off. They </p><p>stood side by side, stripped, the sun </p><p>already beating hot upon their naked bod- </p><p>ies. As he looked down, Northrup mar- </p><p>veled how the desert had made her children </p><p>into what they must be to wrest nourish- </p><p>ment and draw life from her barren breasts. </p><p> The men were alike, as he looked upon</p><p>them from the back. Their shoulders were </p><p>not wide, though they were tall men, both </p><p>of them. Their bodies were slender, almost </p><p>reed-like in smooth symmetry and pliant </p><p>toughness. There was no hint of a useless </p><p>ounce of flesh, nothing but hard muscle. </p><p> But while bigness of body was nowhere</p><p>evident in the torsos, which were none the </p><p>less magnificent, the hips were thicker than </p><p>the hips of white men, the thighs bulged </p><p>out with endurance in every knotted sinew; </p><p>the calves were the swelling, powerful calves </p><p>of Marathon men. </p><p> The desert Indian in his heart is a born</p><p>gambler, his love for hazard no whit less </p><p>than the Mongolian’s. Already were the </p><p>onlookers caught in a fever of excitement </p><p>as they cried out for their favorites and eag- </p><p>erly sought takers for their wagers. From </p><p>the voices coming up to him Northrup knew </p><p>that one man was seeking to bet his whole </p><p>year’s yield of corn that Tiyo would come </p><p>in the victor; that another staked many </p><p>gold cups on Muyingwa; that even the </p><p>women were wagering personal ornaments. </p><p> “Where will they run?” he asked of Ya-</p><p>hoya. </p><p> “Yonder,” she pointed, “to the foot of</p><p>that peak, without water on the way. </p><p>There grow red flowers that are found no- </p><p>where else. The one who brings the first</p><p>flower back wins. It is the custom.” </p><p> Northrup judged that to the base of the</p><p>cliff it was at the least fifteen miles. A race </p><p>of thirty miles through the hot sun, and </p><p>without water! </p><p> “Who will win?”</p><p> She shook her head thoughtfully.</p><p> “It lies with the gods, Saxnorthrup.</p><p>There are in the world no two runners like </p><p>them since Chiwakala is dead. No man </p><p>could beat them—except you, Saxnorth- </p><p>rup!” she ended loyally. </p><p> “Good Lord!” grunted Northrup. “I’d</p><p>shrivel up in about ten minutes!” But he </p><p>spoke in English. </p><p>Yahoya </p><p>45 </p><p> Inaa made his way through the throng</p><p>which drew back for him. From a cup in </p><p>his hand he sprinkled water upon both men. </p><p> “The gods watch you, my sons,” he said</p><p>loudly. “Run!” </p><p> They broke away from the throng which</p><p>watched them silently and went down the </p><p>gentle slope from the canon mouth at a </p><p>trot, their elbows rubbing. Northrup </p><p>noted how Tiyo held his arms drawn up a </p><p>little so that the relaxed hands were close </p><p>to his stomach; how Muyingwa ran with his </p><p>arms at his sides, the hands dangling. </p><p> And in their action he saw no other differ-</p><p>ence. There was the same free stride, the </p><p>same way of bending the body slightly for- </p><p>ward with the head held up a little, the same </p><p>easy play of muscles and rhythmic swing. </p><p> “If I had to bet on either of them,” was</p><p>his thought, “I’d toss a coin for it.” </p><p> And then, mindful of what the result of</p><p>the race might mean to Yahoya and to him, </p><p>he cried sharply: </p><p> “Go to it, Muyingwa! I’m backing you!”</p><p>Like two great, gaunt greyhounds, Tiyo </p><p>and Muyingwa were already slipping out </p><p>into the desert, their bare feet seeming </p><p>scarcely to touch the loose sand. Each </p><p>had hit his stride, and Northrup saw that </p><p>now Muyingwa was setting the pace, forg- </p><p>ing a step ahead, and that Tiyo seemed </p><p>quite content to drop the step behind. He </p><p>frowned as he asked of Yahoya-— </p><p> “Which man has won the most races in</p><p>his life?” </p><p> And she answered—</p><p> “Tiyo.”</p><p> Steadily, each keeping to his stride, the</p><p>two passed out into the gray expanse, Muy- </p><p>ingwa increasing the distance lying between </p><p>him and his rival, Tiyo never seeming to </p><p>see Muyingwa. Now, more than ever be- </p><p>fore, did the desert seem like a mighty </p><p>ocean, with these men, two bold swimmers, </p><p>striking straight out into it, and the thought</p><p>must arise in the mind of a white man who </p><p>watched them: “Is their strength so mighty </p><p>a thing that it will not forsake them before </p><p>they can get back?” </p><p> But they would be back soon enough, and</p><p>then there would be a settling of scores. </p><p> Northrup drew his eyes away from the</p><p>two forms growing smaller in the distance, </p><p>beginning to blend into the monotone of </p><p>desert, and stared down at the throng below </p><p>him. He found Strang in a center of a </p><p>group of silent, attentive men. Beyond </p><p>him was Inaa, the priest, also with his </p><p>group around him. </p><p> “They are like a crowd of schoolboys,”</p><p>thought Northrup. “Ready to break off </p><p>in the middle of a fight to watch a race; </p><p>ready to get into mischief again the next </p><p>minute.” </p><p> “Yahoya,” he said gently, “do you know</p><p>what it will mean for us if Tiyo wins this </p><p>race?” </p><p> “Yes.” She spoke quite steadily, slip-</p><p>ping her hand into his, and smiling a little. </p><p>“But we are not afraid to die, you and I, </p><p>Saxnorthrup.” </p><p> “So it would be death then?”</p><p> “For you,” she told him, “it would be a</p><p>laborer’s work down in the mines. For me </p><p>it would mean bride to Tiyo, or my own </p><p>knife in my heart. We would not wait, </p><p>Saxnorthrup, you and I.” </p><p> “What would we do?” he asked curi-</p><p>ously, wondering at the girl’s calmness. </p><p> “When we saw Tiyo running home before</p><p>Muyingwa we would leap out to meet him, </p><p>Saxnorthrup. Hand in hand, as lovers </p><p>should.” </p><p> “You love me like that, Yahoya?”</p><p> She pressed his hand hard in her own.</p><p>“That is the only way Yahoya knows how </p><p>to love, my husband. But I am praying to </p><p>Haruing Wuhti and Kokang Wuhti that it </p><p>may be Muyingwa who races home first.” </p><p>“In either case there is going to be trou- </p><p>ble,” he said thoughtfully. “Those men</p><p>down there are not to be cheated of their </p><p>fight. While they are watching the race, </p><p>should we try to leave by the way which I </p><p>came?” </p><p> “Where you go I go with you,” she an-</p><p>swered. “But if they wished they could </p><p>come up with us out in the desert, and </p><p>there are no cliffs out there for us to leap </p><p>from, Saxnorthrup.” </p><p>MEN were already coming up from </p><p>the canon, seeking the heights from </p><p>which they might watch the race </p><p>until Tiyo and Muyingwa were lost to even </p><p>their piercing eyes. In a little the level </p><p>space would be crowded. </p><p> “Let us go back into the house, Yahoya,”</p><p>suggested Northrup. “There we can be </p><p>alone for a little. And there we can have </p><p>certain men come presently whom we shall </p><p>want to talk with.” </p><p> Before they could gain the wide doorway</p><p>Northrup saw many hard, frowning eyes </p><p>46 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>turned upon him, and knew that a little </p><p>while ago these same eyes had looked on </p><p>laughingly at his wedding with Yahoya. </p><p>The Indians had enjoyed the moment, had </p><p>found perhaps a pleasure in piquing at </p><p>once Strang and Tiyo and Inaa, had yielded </p><p>to the impulse of the moment and Yahoya’s </p><p>influence over them. But now stood out </p><p>their eternal hatred of a white man. </p><p> Quickly the level space about the pool</p><p>and the spires of rock uplifted into the air </p><p>were covered with men seeking to find the </p><p>two little moving dots in the wide sweep of </p><p>sand. Early among them came the girl, </p><p>Nayangap. With no glance at Northrup </p><p>now, stooping swiftly, she caught up the </p><p>hem of Yahoya’s gown and lifted it to her </p><p>lips. </p><p> “Yahoya,” she said softly, her voice</p><p>troubled, as were her eyes, “goddess or maid, </p><p>it is all the same to the heart of Nayangap. </p><p>In her heart Nayangap loves you and wor- </p><p>ships.” </p><p> “You are a good girl,” said Yahoya, with</p><p>a little touch of her old air of a young queen. </p><p>“Look. I give you this.” </p><p> She caught up one of the many jeweled</p><p>cups from the floor. Nayangap shook her </p><p>head, saying quickly: </p><p> “Nayangap does not come for presents.</p><p>She brings you word from Muyingwa.” </p><p>Northrup looked at the girl eagerly. For </p><p>the first time now, Nayangap looked at </p><p>him. And it was to him rather than to </p><p>Yahoya that she spoke. </p><p> “Muyingwa will win the race, because he</p><p>is the better man, and because the gods love </p><p>him best! Then his followers—and they are </p><p>many—will name him head captain of the </p><p>young men, in Tiyo’s place. Then, too, </p><p>the good men who are fair in their hearts </p><p>will name him head captain because they </p><p>have said the man who wins will be their </p><p>chief. But there are others and they are </p><p>many, too, who are nukpana. They will </p><p>break their promises as if they were the </p><p>shells of humming-birds’ eggs. Then, be- </p><p>cause Muyingwa is no coward, there may be </p><p>a great spilling of blood.”</p><p> “Go on,” said Northrup impatiently,</p><p>seeing that the girl was stopping. </p><p> Her eyes had been very hard. Now, sud-</p><p>denly, they grew soft, and into her dusky </p><p>cheeks a tide of red surged up. </p><p> “Muyingwa loves power and gold!” she</p><p>cried passionately. “Muyingwa loves to </p><p>strive with other men. But most of all </p><p>Muyingwa loves a mana, and that mana is </p><p>Nayangap! His heart sings like a thrush </p><p>and makes music in Nayangap’s heart when </p><p>he comes to her. </p><p> “Nayangap loves gold, too, and she loves</p><p>power for Muyingwa, and pretty gowns for </p><p>herself. But most of all she loves Muying- </p><p>wa’s self. And after Muyingwa she loves </p><p>Yahoya! This Muyingwa knows. His </p><p>heart is big; he would give to his mana all </p><p>things. So he has called me aside before the </p><p>race and told me what I must do for Yaho- </p><p>ya’s sake.” </p><p> “If Yahoya were in truth goddess,” cried</p><p>Yahoya, her eyes bright, “she would make </p><p>Muyingwa this day overlord of all the </p><p>Seven Cities! Since she is but a maid like </p><p>you, Nayangap, she prays to the gods for </p><p>him.” </p><p> “This is the word of Muyingwa,” went on</p><p>Nayangap swiftly. “There will be a great </p><p>struggle and many men will go down to </p><p>Maski. But Muyingwa will win because he </p><p>will have the stronger party, and because </p><p>the gods are with him. He has no love for </p><p>the Man of Wisdom, who has tricked him, </p><p>saying that Yahoya would be left free to do </p><p>what she wished. </p><p> “Muyingwa says that if the fight comes</p><p>Yahoya is to stay in her kiva, where harm </p><p>can not come to her; and that her lover, </p><p>Yellow Beard, shall come out to stand at </p><p>Muyingwa’s right hand and fight the fight </p><p>with him.” </p><p> “Askwali. I thank you,” said Yahoya</p><p>gently. “You will bring us water and food, </p><p>Nayangap. Yellow Beard shall rest here </p><p>and sleep, so that when the time comes </p><p>he shall fight a man’s fight. That is </p><p>best.” </p><p> Nayangap withdrew upon her errand,</p><p>going swiftly. Yahoya came to Northrup, </p><p>then, putting up her arms, looking up into </p><p>his face: </p><p> “My man,” she said softly. “Kiss me!’</p><p>And when he had kissed her: “I love you. </p><p>I am proud of you. You are such a man </p><p>as never before came into the world. If you </p><p>fall to-day I shall run out and throw myself </p><p>upon your body and die with you. If you </p><p>live I shall live always with you in paradise. </p><p>Kiss me again. And now sleep, Saxnorth- </p><p>rup.” </p><p> The wonder is that Northrup did sleep.</p><p>He awoke from a dream of sitting in a box </p><p>at the theater with Yahoya, watching her </p><p>while she watched the actors. Yahoya was </p><p>Yahoya </p><p>47 </p><p>bending over him, her hand laid lightly </p><p>upon his shoulder. </p><p> “The lookout has called out that he can</p><p>see them returning, Muyingwa and Tiyo,” </p><p>she said gravely. “Shall we go out and </p><p>watch them, you and I?” </p><p> XV</p><p>PASSING with Yahoya through </p><p>the curtained doorway into the </p><p>larger room, Northrup saw that at </p><p>the wider entrance there were two young </p><p>men standing, their backs turned toward him. </p><p> “Two of Muyingwa’s men,” said Yahoya.</p><p>“He sent them to stand guard here.” </p><p>Northrup stopped to offer his hand to </p><p>each. </p><p> “If there is a fight,” he said, “we fight</p><p>together? That is good.” </p><p> Their eyes upon his were hard and ex-</p><p>pressionless. </p><p> “We are Muyingwa’s men,” said one</p><p>bluntly. “We obey our orders.” </p><p> Again there were many men upon the</p><p>ledge, all looking out toward the desert </p><p>where their eyes had found the forms of the </p><p>racers. Before Northrup and Yahoya had </p><p>come to where they too could see, Strang </p><p>had moved out of a knot of men and had </p><p>come swiftly to meet them. A good deal of </p><p>the bluster of a few hours ago had oozed </p><p>out of him; he was looking anxious. </p><p> “Look here, Northrup,” he said hurriedly,</p><p>“it strikes me that there’s going to be an </p><p>almighty row in no time. You and I have </p><p>had our troubles and there’s no denying it. </p><p>But at a time like this I guess we’ve got to </p><p>remember we’re white men stacked up </p><p>against a bunch of damned Indians. You </p><p>chip in on my side, and I’ll see you through </p><p>if we come out of this alive.” </p><p> Strang was armed like the Indians; now</p><p>Northrup was certain that the man had </p><p>either lost his gun out in the desert or had </p><p>had it taken away from him here. </p><p> “I’ll chip in on your side,” returned</p><p>Northrup coldly, “not because I am fool </p><p>enough to believe a man like you, Strang, </p><p>but just because I see my one chance with </p><p>your crowd.” </p><p> He saw in Strang’s eyes a quick light of</p><p>eagerness. Then the light died down, the </p><p>eyes grew anxious again. Plainly Strang </p><p>was afraid. He sought to speak further, </p><p>but Northrup and Yahoya passed on. </p><p>Everywhere were black looks turned </p><p>upon them, many men sneering openly at </p><p>Yahoya, who was no longer goddess, but </p><p>mere maid; many of them speaking of him </p><p>in ugly voices, which they did not seek to </p><p>keep from his ears. Northrup looked at </p><p>Yahoya swiftly; it was if she had neither </p><p>seen nor heard. </p><p> But again men forgot them for the mo-</p><p>ment. Tiyo and Muyingwa from being </p><p>mere slow, drifting dots grew into two men, </p><p>striving mightily. From afar it was clear </p><p>that they had fought their way, mile after </p><p>mile, with skill and cunning and muscle. </p><p>They were now two staggering, dust-cov- </p><p>ered forms, and no mau yet could tell which </p><p>was Muyingwa, which Tiyo. </p><p> On they came, plunging across the loose</p><p>sand which caught at the feet that no longer </p><p>might spurn it lightly, their lean bodies </p><p>crouching, their arms dangling, their knees </p><p>rising and falling only because stubborn </p><p>wills drove them. On they staggered, nei- </p><p>ther man looking up, their hearts near </p><p>bursting, their dry, dusty tongues lolling, </p><p>their bodies rocking as in agony. On </p><p>through a reeling world, with only a scant </p><p>two or three yards between them. </p><p> And only silence greeting them, as men</p><p>strove to see which of those dark, tortured </p><p>forms grasping a wilted flower in a dangling </p><p>hand, was Tiyo, which Muyingwa. </p><p> Then, at last, they had come so close to</p><p>the base of the cliffs that they were recog- </p><p>nizable human beings, no longer merely ex- </p><p>hausted machines. A great crowd rumbled </p><p>out to greet them then, many voices shout- </p><p>ing together— </p><p> “Tiyo!”</p><p> For it was Tiyo in the lead. Even North-</p><p>rup saw that now, and realized swiftly that </p><p>Tiyo’s winning would strengthen Tiyo’s </p><p>hand, so that there would be little hope for </p><p>Muyingwa and those whom he stood ready </p><p>to befriend. </p><p> At the shout the two men jerked up their</p><p>heads. Their faces were twisted and hag- </p><p>gard; their mouths dropped open; their </p><p>eyes were wild, telling mutely of the </p><p>anguish-racked bodies upon which so terri- </p><p>ble a tax had been levied. </p><p> Then the heads dropped, the gaunt forms</p><p>staggered on, feet sinking deep into the </p><p>sand, being caught there, dragged out with </p><p>effort more and more obvious. And still, no </p><p>great distance between them and the end </p><p>of the long run, Tiyo held his place in the </p><p>lead. </p><p>ri </p><p>48 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Now many voices called out, “Muying-</p><p>wa! Muyingwa!” but they called half- </p><p>heartedly. Through the bedlam rose the </p><p>shrill cry of a woman, a wail of grief; Nayan- </p><p>gap, hurrying down the stairway to meet </p><p>her defeated lover, carried to him a face </p><p>scarcely less tortured than his own. Ya- </p><p>hoya slipped her hand into Northrup’s. </p><p> “Look,” she whispered. “If to-day you</p><p>fall, my husband, Yahoya will fall with </p><p>you!” </p><p> The sun flashed a moment upon the keen</p><p>blade she had slipped from her gown. </p><p>Then, as quickly as it had come, the knife </p><p>was gone, and she was pressing his hand </p><p>hard. </p><p> On came Tiyo, staggering more drunk-</p><p>enly than ever, fighting for every step. On </p><p>came Muyingwa just behind him, head </p><p>down and dogged. Cheer after cheer broke </p><p>out to greet the victor; cheer after cheer </p><p>drummed into the ears of the man who had </p><p>challenged and who was losing. </p><p> Inaa, his eyes seeming on fire, was draw-</p><p>ing with a sacred baho a small circle at the </p><p>head of the slope. Already were Tiyo’s </p><p>feet upon the harder ground, already was he </p><p>plunging, reeling up the first of the hundred </p><p>yards of incline. He swung up one arm </p><p>with a visible effort, showing the fingers </p><p>gripping the stem of the red flower. Inaa’s </p><p>voice, until now stilled, called out trium- </p><p>phantly: </p><p> “On, Tiyo, my son! The victor’s circle,</p><p>wherein is room for one man only, awaits </p><p>you! On, Tiyo!” </p><p> Then Tiyo turned a little for the first</p><p>time and saw Muyingwa’s bowed, reeling </p><p>form behind him. Tiyo’s staring eyes and </p><p>panting mouth grew into a twisted smile. </p><p>Then Tiyo did not turn again. </p><p> As they ran the two men stumbled now,</p><p>their numb feet striking against the stones </p><p>in their path, each seeming ever upon the </p><p>verge of falling. If Tiyo should indeed fall </p><p>—if Muyingwa fell—then before either man </p><p>could get upon his feet the race would be </p><p>lost.</p><p> It seemed to Northrup that Muyingwa</p><p>was driving some last ounce of reserve </p><p>strength into his lagging limbs. It seemed </p><p>while a man could not be certain, that he </p><p>had shaved off a fraction of the half-dozen </p><p>feet stretching between him and Tiyo. But </p><p>if he had cut off an inch, what of it? There </p><p>were but seventy-five yards now, and Tiyo </p><p>was a man’s height in advance. </p><p> Northrup caught a glimpse of a face</p><p>thrust close up to his own, Strang’s face. </p><p>The blood had drawn out of it, leaving a </p><p>strange pallor over the sunburned skin. </p><p> “The - quitter!” groaned Strang.</p><p>“He said he could beat Tiyo!” </p><p> “You talk about a quitter!” snapped</p><p>Northrup. “Shut up!” </p><p> It seemed now that nothing less than</p><p>miracle could save the day for Muyingwa, </p><p>unless Tiyo should fall. And why should </p><p>one fall rather than the other? </p><p> There was a flutter of white close by</p><p>Inaa’s side. Nayangap stood there, her </p><p>arms thrown out toward the men racing so </p><p>slowly up the broken slope. </p><p> “Muyingwa!” she called. “Muyingwa!”</p><p>He did not lift his head as he struggled </p><p>on; he gave no sign that he had heard. And </p><p>yet, in the silence which had fallen, a silence </p><p>of breathless, intense eagerness, he could </p><p>not but have heard. </p><p> “Tiyo!” thundered Inaa. “Tiyo! Ti-yo!”</p><p>“Muyingwa!” cried Nayangap. “Mu- </p><p>yingwa!” </p><p> The eyes of those who watched, drawn</p><p>for an instant to the forms of the old man </p><p>and the young mana, came back quickly to </p><p>the runners. Was it in the seeming only, </p><p>or had Muyingwa crept a little closer? </p><p>With hard ground underfoot, with Nayan- </p><p>gap’s voice ringing in his ears, had he added </p><p>a little swiftness to his slow plodding? Had </p><p>he, in fact, held a little reserve force for the </p><p>final dash? Was Tiyo, already so close to </p><p>the victor’s circle, and with his rival in his </p><p>rear, already the victor? </p><p> It was ending as a distance run so rarely</p><p>ends, with the end in doubt until the very </p><p>close of endeavor. Muyingwa was gaining. </p><p>Tiyo was driving his muscles harder and </p><p>harder at every lagging step to make them </p><p>bend to his will. But they were only </p><p>twenty-five yards from the goal, and Tiyo </p><p>still led the way. </p><p> “Tiyo!” shouted Inaa.</p><p> “Muyingwa!” cried the girl, her voice</p><p>throbbing in its appeal. </p><p> Then all were still, their bodies tense,</p><p>their breathing hushed, their hearts beating </p><p>thickly. Northrup’s hand, gripping Yaho- </p><p>ya’s, grew into a vise, which at another </p><p>time would have hurt her cruelly. Yahoya </p><p>did not feel it. </p><p> There was no sound now save the rattle</p><p>of stones set rolling, the thud, thud, thud of </p><p>bare bleeding feet dropping heavily, the </p><p>Yahoya </p><p>49 </p><p>gasping breathing of Tiyo and Muyingwa. </p><p>One might fancy that he heard the hammer- </p><p>ing of their hearts, despair in one not un- </p><p>tinged with wild hope, victory in the other </p><p>touched with dread. For Tiyo could hear </p><p>Muyingwa’s whistling breath close upon </p><p>his right, a step behind. </p><p> So they came to the worst of the broken</p><p>ground not a dozen yards from the circle </p><p>Inaa had drawn. Here an exhausted man </p><p>might fall if he were not wary. In each of </p><p>the bursting hearts was the same thought: </p><p>if a man fall now he sees his rival win. </p><p> Tiyo, having everything to lose, feeling</p><p>himself already crowned with green leaves </p><p>and yellow flowers, swerved a step to the </p><p>left. Muyingwa, feeling the game all but </p><p>lost already, kept straight ahead. His </p><p>thudding feet struck among the jagged </p><p>stones, which cut at them and tore them </p><p>with cruel knife-edges. Muyingwa felt </p><p>nothing, but flung himself forward, stagger- </p><p>ing, falling, catching himself, staggering on. </p><p> Tiyo saw him from the corner of his eye,</p><p>abreast now, and, gathering his last strength, </p><p>reeled on, gaining a little. Muyingwa saw a </p><p>white, fluttering gown just there in front </p><p>of him, saw Tiyo at his side, and made the </p><p>supreme call upon his quivering muscles. </p><p>He struck a stone in his way, pitching over </p><p>it, close to falling for the hundredth time. </p><p> “Muyingwa!” Hardly more than a</p><p>maid’s whisper, but many men heard it. </p><p>“My man!” </p><p> Tiyo had run his race, and was tottering</p><p>almost at the rim of the circle his dizzy eyes </p><p>could not see. Muyingwa was like a spent </p><p>ball, plowing on with its own momentum. </p><p>Tiyo’s foot struck a little mound of loose </p><p>dirt and he fell. As he went down he threw </p><p>out his hand, and Muyingwa, striking it, </p><p>fell with him. Both men down, and the </p><p>goal just there, where it seemed either man </p><p>might reach it! </p><p> Then men shouted as they had not shout-</p><p>ed until now, so that Inaa’s voice and Na- </p><p>yangap’s were lost in the thunderous roar. </p><p>The canon echoes went mad with the word, </p><p>“Tiyo, Tiyo, Tiyo!”</p><p> The canon walls themselves seemed to</p><p>have awakened, moved at last from their </p><p>cold slumber, and to be shouting, “Mu- </p><p>yingwa!” Northrup heard men yelling about </p><p>him, and did not know that his own voice </p><p>was lending its volume to theirs. </p><p> Would the men never get to their feet?</p><p>Did they not know what hung upon them? </p><p>Were they loitering now at the very end? </p><p> But they were up now. They were</p><p>going on, both of them. It seemed as if </p><p>they were seeking to drive men mad, lifting </p><p>their feet so slowly, holding them so long </p><p>suspended in air, taking such puny, baby </p><p>steps ahead. Even their faces were drawn </p><p>into grotesque grins, as if they were mocking </p><p>those who clamored for them, jeering at the </p><p>world. Who was ahead now? Their elbows </p><p>struck. </p><p> But now men saw that at each slow step</p><p>it was Tiyo who held longest balanced upon </p><p>his spreading toes; it was Tiyo’s leg which </p><p>held longest suspended in air. </p><p> Muyingwa threw high up above his head</p><p>the hand gripping the broken flower. Sway- </p><p>ing terribly, Muyingwa set his foot over the </p><p>circle. </p><p> Muyingwa stood first in the narrow circle</p><p>wherein there is room for only one man. </p><p>Then, staring stupidly at Nayangap he </p><p>half turned, seeing through a blur another </p><p>man coming on falteringly. Then Mu- </p><p>yingwa, not hearing the roar of voices, </p><p>dropped his arm, stooped a little, a little </p><p>more, sought to lift his hand and could not, </p><p>rocked blindly back and forth, and then, </p><p>strength and consciousness going out of </p><p>him, fell heavily. And as he fell, Tiyo’s </p><p>body pitched forward and fell across him. </p><p>XVI </p><p>“QUICK!” cried Northrup sharply. </p><p>“Into your house, Yahoya. We </p><p>must be ready now for what comes!” </p><p> Drawing her after him he hurried through</p><p>the clamoring throng. He realized that now </p><p>for a moment, men would not be thinking of </p><p>him and Yahoya. Now was the time for </p><p>him to get her where she would be safest.</p><p>He would not have been afraid for Yahoya </p><p>had it not been for the look he had seen in </p><p>Inaa’s eyes so few hours ago. The old man’s </p><p>temper would have hardly been sweetened by </p><p>Tiyo’s defeat, nor his anger at Yahoya </p><p>lessened. </p><p> The two men Muyingwa had deputed to</p><p>stand guard at the kiva’s entrance had quite </p><p>naturally forsaken their posts, but were </p><p>back now as Yahoya and Northrup went in. </p><p> That day Northrup and Yahoya sat long</p><p>alone together in her little room, waiting. </p><p>Nor did time drag for them, there was so </p><p>much in each heart which must be told to </p><p>the other. </p><p>50 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> As the man looked into the clear gray</p><p>eyes, fearless, and filled with the love she </p><p>had given him so generously, he sought to </p><p>close his thoughts to what might lie in the </p><p>future for them both. One of the rare mo- </p><p>ments of a man’s life had come to him when </p><p>past and future are hazy and unimportant, </p><p>when he lives richly and to the full in the </p><p>glowing present. He no longer marveled </p><p>at the love which had come to them. It </p><p>seemed as natural a thing as the sunshine </p><p>outside. </p><p> A third man joined the two at the door,</p><p>spoke with them in quick, sharp tones, and </p><p>went away. The two remained, keeping their </p><p>silent watch, calm, seeming untouched by </p><p>thought of a near crisis. Tocha came and </p><p>brought food, saying that Nayangap was </p><p>with Muyingwa, and that both her lover </p><p>and Tiyo were like men whose souls had </p><p>gone down to Maski. </p><p> All forms had disappeared from the ledge</p><p>where the pool was. Yahoya’s parrot </p><p>swayed upon his branch, admired his gay </p><p>plumage in the water’s clear mirror, and </p><p>flew to the kiva seeking his mistress. From </p><p>the canon where the men of the tribe were </p><p>assembled came a voice only now and then </p><p>at long intervals. Then, at last, came Na- </p><p>yangap, her eyes bright, her face suffused </p><p>with happiness, a strange elation in her man- </p><p>ner. </p><p> “Listen!” she cried to Yahoya, running</p><p>to her mistress. “In a moment you will </p><p>hear the shouting. Down there they pro- </p><p>claim Muyingwa head captain in Tiyo’s </p><p>place!” </p><p> “And Tiyo?” demanded Northrup ea-</p><p>gerly. “What does he say about it?” </p><p> “Is not Muyingwa the greater man, the</p><p>better?” the girl flashed at him. “Did not </p><p>Muyingwa beat Tiyo so that all men might </p><p>laugh?” </p><p> Northrup had not noted that Tiyo’s de-</p><p>feat was so marked as that, but he said </p><p>nothing. Yahoya smiled a little at her </p><p>maid’s loyal enthusiasm. </p><p> “Men who are wise and men who are</p><p>good,” ran on Nayangap, “will draw to </p><p>Muyingwa’s side, calling him their chief. </p><p>Men whose hearts are black and who listen </p><p>to the words of Inaa will stand with Tiyo. </p><p>Then will Muyingwa lead his men out and </p><p>strike down the men of Tiyo!” </p><p> Before she had finished Strang came hur-</p><p>riedly into the kiva, brushing by her rudely. </p><p> “Both of them are on their feet again,”</p><p>he said quickly. “They have eaten and </p><p>drunk, and though they have been already </p><p>through hell today, both of them are as fit </p><p>right now as an ordinary man! What are </p><p>the devils made of? And trouble is coming, </p><p>coming quick!” </p><p> “Why then are you not with your men?”</p><p>cried Yahoya swiftly. “It is you who have </p><p>stirred them up to this madness, you with </p><p>your whisperings! And now you come here </p><p>—you coward!” </p><p> “Coward, am I?” he snarled at her.</p><p>“What about the man you keep here with </p><p>you?” </p><p> He broke off sharply. From the canon</p><p>came the mighty shout, “Muyingwa!” And, </p><p>as had already so many times happened, </p><p>an answering shout arose, “Tiyo!” </p><p> It had come. Until strength had crept</p><p>back into the two exhausted bodies of their </p><p>principals, the tribe had waited. Now, </p><p>moved everywhere by Muyingwa’s ringing </p><p>words and Inaa’s, fierce fire had flashed out </p><p>of smoldering restlessness. There came </p><p>other cries, sharper cries, the shriek of a </p><p>man with a knife driven into his body. </p><p> Northrup, gathering Yahoya passion-</p><p>ately into his arms, held her there a long </p><p>moment. Then he pushed by Strang, and </p><p>ran out to the edge of the cliffs. </p><p>BELOW, the men of the tribe had </p><p>drawn into two compact masses, </p><p>fronting each other ominously, their </p><p>short stabbing spears lifted. Between them </p><p>lay a man, writhing, slowly growing still. </p><p>Northrup’s first thought was that it might </p><p>be Muyingwa or Tiyo. But another glance </p><p>showed both of them in front of their fac- </p><p>tions. </p><p> Suddenly, Muyingwa shouted out some-</p><p>thing, and his men, following him, ran </p><p>toward the long stairway. Tiyo saw, un- </p><p>derstood, and shouting bore down upon </p><p>them. Northrup, seeing that both factions </p><p>strove now for the higher ground, ran to </p><p>the head of the stairway, his automatic </p><p>gripped, ready for use. </p><p> The fighting began at the foot of the</p><p>stairway. Already the two sides had mixed, </p><p>for, although Muyingwa’s men came first </p><p>to the stair, its narrow steepness held them </p><p>back a little. Northrup saw Muyingwa’s </p><p>form surrounded by his men, saw Tiyo and </p><p>Inaa, and the great spare form of the man </p><p>Strang had selected for head priest to re- </p><p>place Inaa. He saw the whole body of men </p><p>Yahoya </p><p>51 </p><p>bristling with short spears and great knives, </p><p>the sun glittering upon them brightly, </p><p>seething back and forth, struggling for the </p><p>stair. </p><p> One by one Muyingwa’s men in the fore</p><p>were passing up; in the rear they were </p><p>striking now, dealing death, and often </p><p>enough being dragged down to the death. </p><p> And in the strange silence which fell over</p><p>them, all the struggle down there looked </p><p>some weird play, scarcely real. It was hard </p><p>for him to convince himself that this was </p><p>not a mock battle, that the distorted faces, </p><p>the writhing of fallen bodies, was not all </p><p>sham and skilful acting. About them the </p><p>mountains were so serene, above, the skies </p><p>so deep a blue, the whole atmosphere so </p><p>charged with quiet peacefulness. High in </p><p>air a vulture hung on motionless wings, </p><p>watching with sharp eyes. </p><p> But when men fell stricken by those great</p><p>knives and two-edged spears, they did not </p><p>move from where they had fallen; or at best </p><p>but dragged their wounded bodies a little </p><p>way to fall and lie still. Tiyo’s men pressed </p><p>forward; Muyingwa’s men held back, and </p><p>many were swiftly mounting the stairs. </p><p> At that Northrup wondered. For cer-</p><p>tainly Muyingwa’s force was larger than </p><p>the one that attacked him, and as certainly </p><p>Muyingwa was no coward. But now he </p><p>drew his men back, ever back, until they </p><p>had gained the stairway, while Tiyo’s sinis- </p><p>ter crowd charged stubbornly. </p><p> Now men were contending everywhere,</p><p>upon the floor of the canon, along the cliff </p><p>sides, even at the top of the stairway, close </p><p>to where Northrup stood. He saw them go </p><p>down under vicious thrusts, saw two of </p><p>them, their arms locked about each other, </p><p>their skins red with many wounds, reel out- </p><p>ward and drop fifty feet. And as yet the </p><p>gun in his hand was cold, for there was no </p><p>way for him to determine which man was </p><p>Muyingwa’s man, which Tiyo’s. And to </p><p>chance a shot at Tiyo or at Inaa in that </p><p>packed mass would be to waste lead, or per- </p><p>haps to kill a friend of Muyingwa. </p><p> Now he saw something which he could</p><p>not understand. He figured roughly that </p><p>the tribe numbered between two and three </p><p>hundred men. Muyingwa and the men </p><p>with him now pressing up the steep way </p><p>which led to the ledge were not over twenty- </p><p>five in number; the party at Tiyo’s heels </p><p>could have numbered only about that. </p><p>And down in the canon the rest of the men, </p><p>a great mass of them, had drawn aside, and </p><p>were merely watching. </p><p> At last Muyingwa had come to the top.</p><p>He stood there, shouting out his short com- </p><p>mands, then stepped back, his men follow- </p><p>ing him, leaving the way open for such men </p><p>as might wish to come up after them. This </p><p>again seemed madness to Northrup, who, </p><p>grumbling, gave way with the others. It </p><p>was Muyingwa’s voice in his ear that ex- </p><p>plained. </p><p> “Let them come, Yellow Beard! We</p><p>shall fight them here in the open, man to </p><p>man!” </p><p> “But the others, down there?” demanded</p><p>Northrup. </p><p> “It is my fight and Tiyo’s. Each of us</p><p>has chosen twenty-five of his young men. </p><p>The rest watch. And I have chosen the </p><p>Man of Wisdom and you to be of my num- </p><p>ber.” </p><p> “Then,” cried Northrup hotly, “why do</p><p>you wait for them to come up with you? </p><p>You have the advantage now; strike as </p><p>they climb up!” </p><p> An odd smile touched Muyingwa’s stern</p><p>lips. </p><p> “It is in my heart to fight fair, Yellow</p><p>Beard. It is not Muyingwa’s wish to be </p><p>named the ‘Fox.’ Men already speak of </p><p>him as the Eagle Chief! Let them come!” </p><p> “Then,” demanded Northrup, “why</p><p>didn’t you fight your fight down there? </p><p>You had the chance.” </p><p> Muyingwa shook his head.</p><p> “I will tell you, Yellow Beard, but time</p><p>has passed for long words. I am the better </p><p>man, and Tiyo knew that when he raced</p><p>with me. But for trickery on his part I </p><p>should have come into the circle an hour be- </p><p>fore him. Look!” </p><p> He threw up his arm, and for the first</p><p>time Northrup saw a long gash in the man’s </p><p>side. </p><p> “When we were far out, where men could</p><p>not see us,” he said, his face black with his </p><p>anger, “Tiyo, who was behind, ran like a </p><p>madman that he might come up with me. </p><p>I saved my strength, thinking he had lost </p><p>his senses. Then, when he was upon me, I </p><p>saw that he had carried a knife with him, </p><p>concealing it cunningly under his arm. He </p><p>would have killed me then had I not been </p><p>the greater man! Even so—you saw it— </p><p>I won over him.” </p><p> All of Muyingwa’s men were upon the</p><p>ledge now. At their head man’s command </p><p>52 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>they had drawn back and were watching </p><p>those with Tiyo come up. </p><p> “I have sworn an oath to the great gods,”</p><p>Muyingwa ended briefly. “I have prom- </p><p>ised them that if they let me triumph over </p><p>Tiyo in the race, I should kill Tiyo with my </p><p>own hands in a way that all men might see.” </p><p> Up the stairway, after the last of Tiyo’s</p><p>men, came surging many others who were </p><p>eager to stand back and see. Northrup, </p><p>glancing about, saw that many others were </p><p>climbing swiftly to the cliffs upon the oppo- </p><p>site side of the canon. After that he had </p><p>little enough time or opportunity to see any- </p><p>thing but the steely menace before him. </p><p> Tiyo’s men, mistaken in the reason for</p><p>Muyingwa’s retreat, thinking that they had </p><p>to do with men whose hearts were already </p><p>failing them, bore on at a run, lifting their </p><p>voices in a hideous charging shout. Each </p><p>man carried his stabbing spear drawn a </p><p>little back at his hip, so that when the mo- </p><p>ment came a quick thrust outward would </p><p>drive the keen edges through a man’s body. </p><p>It came to Northrup, even at the moment </p><p>before the running line struck, that Tiyo’s </p><p>was the better generalship, that Muying- </p><p>wa’s men, waiting, must go down before </p><p>the force of the wild attack. </p><p> The spit of Northrup’s gun was lost in the</p><p>storm of shouting. But a man had thrown </p><p>wide his arms and had gone down in a heap. </p><p>They were twenty feet away, every running </p><p>leap cutting the distance down so that </p><p>Northrup must fire as fast as he could to </p><p>empty the first clip. And he realized, and </p><p>his lips tightened grimly, that he would </p><p>have no chance for a second. And still </p><p>Muyingwa’s men were standing erect, wait- </p><p>ing. </p><p> But they were men trained under Mu-</p><p>yingwa’s own eye, cool to the last, mindful of </p><p>orders. Suddenly came Muyingwa’s shout, </p><p>and suddenly the spears in his men’s hands </p><p>were lifted. Lifted, balanced high over- </p><p>head, and, when the eyes of the men charg- </p><p>ing them glared redly not three-spear </p><p>lengths away, the short spears were hurled </p><p>outward. </p><p> Then many of Tiyo’s men went down on</p><p>both sides of Tiyo himself, who came on, </p><p>untouched. </p><p> The two lines met, Tiyo’s men that were</p><p>left wielding their spears mightily, Muying- </p><p>wa’s men driving home their broad-bladed </p><p>knives with little coughing grunts. North- </p><p>rup did not know that his gun was empty, </p><p>that he had cast it down, that somewhere his </p><p>hands had closed about a fallen spear. He </p><p>only knew that about him surged a mad </p><p>carnage, that men were shouting, cursing, </p><p>shrieking; that a man drove at him with up- </p><p>lifted spear, only to graze his shoulder and </p><p>to stop dead in his tracks with Northrup’s </p><p>spear driven fairly through his body. </p><p> Tiyo and Muyingwa had met at last.</p><p>Northrup saw that dimly, as if through a </p><p>fog, saw and forgot as again he was breast </p><p>to breast with a great-bodied man, who was </p><p>red with blood, and who held high above </p><p>his head a dripping knife. </p><p> The knife swept downward, and Northrup</p><p>felt it like a burning iron in his neck and </p><p>shoulder. A wild rage came upon him, a </p><p>burning hatred, and from then on nothing </p><p>was clear to him, no emotion rode him, but </p><p>the one unleased primitive desire to kill, </p><p>kill, kill! He struck out savagely, and the </p><p>man who had cut at him went down and </p><p>did not move. </p><p> Tiyo and Muyingwa were still struggling;</p><p>yonder two of Tiyo’s men drove their spears </p><p>through one man so that the steel heads </p><p>struck together; yonder Strang, his face </p><p>ashen, hurled his spear at a man who rushed </p><p>down upon him and, missing, shrieked </p><p>wildly; close to the edge of the precipice </p><p>three men drove two back, fighting for every </p><p>step of the way. </p><p> Then bigness of body and strength of</p><p>limb stood Sax Northrup in such stead as </p><p>never until now. Where the fray was thick- </p><p>est there was his great form, his clothes </p><p>splotched red, his eyes spitting blue fire, his </p><p>hair and beard wet with blood. When he </p><p>struck, a man must give back; when he </p><p>thrust, a man must go down; when a thirst- </p><p>ing blade drank of his own blood, his roar </p><p>was like the cry of a wounded lion. </p><p> Now it seemed that the struggle had</p><p>swept like great whirlpools about two cen- </p><p>ters. Tiyo and Muyingwa had been swept </p><p>apart, both wounded, both standing grimly </p><p>up to their bloody work. A surging knot of </p><p>men contended near the edge of the cliffs. </p><p>Close to Yahoya’s kiva, Muyingwa was in </p><p>the center of a ring of glittering blades seek- </p><p>ing him. </p><p> Through this ring of men came Northrup,</p><p>like a mad bull breaking through a flimsy </p><p>fence. Two men went down before him, </p><p>and but one rose again. </p><p> He stumbled over a prone man, and did</p><p>not know that it was Strang’s body his foot </p><p>Yahoya </p><p>53 </p><p>had struck. Muyingwa was here, one man </p><p>against a half dozen, and it was unfair fight- </p><p>ing. That was the one thing perfectly plain </p><p>to him. </p><p> But now no longer was Muyingwa one</p><p>against six. Back to back stood Northrup </p><p>and Muyingwa, the two biggest men upon </p><p>the ledge. Muyingwa, striking swiftly, sent </p><p>a shouting laugh out by way of greeting. </p><p> “Well done, Yellow Beard!” he shouted,</p><p>and shouting, thrust. “Well done, broth- </p><p>er!” </p><p> A man went reeling back from his thrust,</p><p>another stepped into his place. Northrup </p><p>struck out, and a man went down. But </p><p>before he could jerk back his spear another </p><p>menacing figure had leaped upon him. </p><p> Northrup saw and swung his body to the</p><p>right, seeking to avoid the glittering death </p><p>leaping out at him. Again he felt a pain like </p><p>the searing of white-hot iron, this time in </p><p>his shoulder, and he went down upon one </p><p>knee, his teeth set hard, the thought upon </p><p>him that soon or late a man must die, and it </p><p>was well to die like a man. He had lived to </p><p>the uttermost, his lips had touched the lips </p><p>of Yahoya; he would not cry out at taking </p><p>the bitter with the sweet. </p><p> But Muyingwa, hard pressed as he was,</p><p>had seen, and the knife he was wielding now </p><p>drove between Northrup and instant death, </p><p>buried to the hilt in the body of the man </p><p>over him. Northrup jerked himself to his </p><p>feet, his groping hand sweeping up his fallen </p><p>spear, blacker rage than ever before in his </p><p>heart that he had seemed a lesser man than </p><p>Muyingwa. And before his berserk rush </p><p>men fell back, muttering. </p><p> There was a great shout from the men at</p><p>the cliff’s edge. Northrup, pursuing a man </p><p>who fled nimbly before him, saw a dozen </p><p>forms racing to meet him and braced himself </p><p>against them. But he saw that they di- </p><p>vided and swept about him, that they must </p><p>be Muyingwa’s men come at last to the aid </p><p>of their chief. </p><p> And then Northrup felt suddenly weary,</p><p>and crouched down close to the precipice.</p><p>It seemed that it was all over. Men stood </p><p>about and did nothing. Northrup was </p><p>alive, so he supposed that his side had won </p><p>in the bloody game of brutes. It had all </p><p>begun so suddenly, seeming merely a hid- </p><p>eous dream. It was ending so absurdly </p><p>suddenly, still like some frenzied night- </p><p>mare, with the broken men lying about </p><p>him. </p><p> His eyes passed by the little knot of idle</p><p>men, and he saw that it had not yet ended. </p><p>Muyingwa still lived, Tiyo lived, and they </p><p>alone fought on. Northrup watched them </p><p>curiously. </p><p> They moved back and forth, spear oppos-</p><p>ing spear, the bright points leaping forward, </p><p>jerking back, thrusting skilfully, guarding </p><p>jealously where death might pay forfeit for </p><p>the wink of an eyelid. But it seemed to </p><p>Northrup that always they drew a litde </p><p>near to him, that it was Muyingwa who was </p><p>forcing the fight, that steadily, but oh, so </p><p>slowly, he was driving Tiyo back. </p><p> Northrup ran his hand across his dimming</p><p>eyes and the hand came away wet. There </p><p>was a cut across his forehead which puzzled </p><p>him; he had felt no wound there. </p><p> Some one came running to him. He saw</p><p>that it was Yahoya. He marveled at the </p><p>look in her eyes. She dropped down beside </p><p>him, her arms about him. </p><p> “Watch them, Yahoya,” he said thickly.</p><p>“It is Muyingwa against Tiyo now.” </p><p> Yes, they were drawing closer. Now</p><p>there could be no doubt of that. Both men </p><p>were wounded, one could not guess how </p><p>badly. But both fought savagely, desper- </p><p>ately, knowing that only in death for one if </p><p>not for both, could the blood feud end. </p><p> “It’s Muyingwa’s fight!” said Northrup</p><p>slowly. “Can’t you see it, Yahoya?” </p><p>Yahoya saw nothing in all the world but </p><p>her lover, crouching at her feet, her lover </p><p>wounded in a dozen places. She sought to </p><p>answer, but he^ voice broke. </p><p> “Look at their eyes,” Northrup insisted.</p><p>“You can guess the end in a man’s eyes at </p><p>a time like this, Yahoya. Tiyo is just des- </p><p>perate, seeking to postpone the end. Mu- </p><p>yingwa is filled with elation. He has made a</p><p>promise to his gods! Can’t you see the </p><p>difference?” </p><p> Yahoya sobbed and knelt, drawing her</p><p>arms tighter about him. On they came, </p><p>Tiyo lunging heavily, but always on the </p><p>guard; Muyingwa, lighter of foot, his eyes </p><p>bright with hard laughter and steely with </p><p>hatred. On, until they were so close that </p><p>Yahoya and Northrup must move a little </p><p>to the side; on until Tiyo dared take no fur- </p><p>ther step backward for fear of a plunge to </p><p>death on the rocks below. </p><p> Then Muyingwa, calling out loudly,</p><p>struck such a blow as he had not yet struck </p><p>The haft of his spear broke against </p><p>Tiyo’s right wrist, and his shattered weapon </p><p>54 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>and Tiyo’s fallen one struck the ground </p><p>together. </p><p> While men looked on, their mouths agape,</p><p>Muyingwa sprang forward, only his hands </p><p>lifted against the knife which Tiyo had </p><p>whipped from his belt with his left hand. </p><p>As Tiyo’s hand went up, Muyingwa’s rose </p><p>with it. As Tiyo’s sought to drive down- </p><p>ward, Muyingwa’s fingers shut hard about </p><p>his wrist. </p><p> Now they struggled man to man, body</p><p>to body, their muscles cracking, the sweat </p><p>running from them like water, red sweat </p><p>across deep cuts. Slowly Tiyo’s hand came </p><p>down, the pointed blade finding its sheath </p><p>only in the empty air. Down and down, </p><p>though Tiyo strove wildly to wrest it away </p><p>from the fingers which shut like iron talons </p><p>about his wrist. And slowly Muyingwa </p><p>forced Tiyo back toward the cliff’s edge. </p><p> “I have sworn, Tiyo,” panted Muyingwa,</p><p>“with my two hands, to cast you straight </p><p>down into Maski! See how I keep my </p><p>promise!” </p><p> Men gasped out at what they saw. The</p><p>skin upon Muyingwa’s bowed back seemed </p><p>splitting asunder with the bunching of the </p><p>muscles under it; the veins in his arms and </p><p>forehead threatened to burst. But the </p><p>fierce flames in his eyes were undimmed by </p><p>thought of failing power. </p><p> For an instant the two struggling forms</p><p>grew still, only the slow swelling of a muscle, </p><p>the hard breathing, telling that they lived </p><p>and strove. But it seemed that strength </p><p>was flowing out of Tiyo, fresh strength </p><p>flowing into Muyingwa. </p><p> Slowly one man bent under the other’s</p><p>iron hands. Slowly Tiyo’s body twisted </p><p>as Muyingwa’s fingers commanded; slowly </p><p>Muyingwa forced him down to his knees. </p><p> Then—there was no slowness now, Mu-</p><p>yingwa’s movement being like a flash of light </p><p>—Tiyo was swept upward in the other’s </p><p>grasp as he had before been swung aloft in </p><p>Northrup’s. Their shadows fell across </p><p>Northrup. Looking up he saw Tiyo’s </p><p>wildly beating arms above him.</p><p> An instant he thought they were both go-</p><p>ing together. Then he saw that with a last </p><p>mighty effort Muyingwa had broken Tiyo’s </p><p>clutch upon him, and, as a great roar rose </p><p>up from the hundreds who watched, Tiyo </p><p>was flung far out. </p><p> Then Northrup gave up to the sickness</p><p>upon him and was quite content to sink </p><p>back into Yahoya’s arms. </p><p> XVII</p><p>“IT WAS a good fight, my brother!” </p><p>Northrup, lying upon the couch </p><p>in Yahoya’s little room, Yahoya’s </p><p>hand held in his, looked up to see the tall, </p><p>gaunt form of Muyingwa in the doorway.. </p><p>“Now,” went on Muyingwa slowly, “am </p><p>I a great man among my people! Now am </p><p>I	head captain of the People of the Hidden</p><p>Spring. There is no man among all in the </p><p>Seven Cities who will not have Muyingwa’s </p><p>name upon his lips. Time may come— </p><p>wTho can look into the darkness of unborn </p><p>tomorrow?—when Muyingwa may step up </p><p>to be Overlord of all the cities of Chebo! </p><p>And, my brother, there was a time when we </p><p>fought yonder, when Muyingwa was close </p><p>to his death, and Yellow Beard came to </p><p>fight the fight with Muyingwa, forcing </p><p>through spearmen like a hungry wolf </p><p>through little rabbits! Askwalil You are </p><p>my brother, Yellow Beard! Muyingwa, </p><p>thirsting on the desert, would share his last </p><p>cup of water with you.” </p><p> “As for that,” answered Northrup, “we</p><p>are even. You saved my life for me——” </p><p>“It was nothing,” cut in Muyingwa. “I </p><p>struck down one man who threatened you. </p><p>You hurled yourself upon many. You </p><p>shall see that I am no man to forget. We </p><p>wait here until your wounds are whole; then </p><p>we move on to Chebo. There already has </p><p>Inaa run to tell his lies; but men shall know </p><p>them for lies. I shall enter the city as a </p><p>great man; Nayangap shall go at my side, </p><p>a great lady for great ladies to wait upon. </p><p>And you, at my right, shall go, not as the </p><p>other Bahana who died like a coward, but as </p><p>Muyingwa’s brother. As Muyingwa rises, </p><p>you shall rise, Yellow Beard!” </p><p> Had one spoken thus to the old Sax</p><p>Northrup, saying, “I will lead you to rich </p><p>cities unknown to white men, where per- </p><p>haps there is wealth to be got and power!” </p><p>there would have been only eagerness in his </p><p>heart. But now—he shook his head. </p><p> “Muyingwa,” he said slowly, “it seems to</p><p>me that it is only a little thing I have done </p><p>for you, no greater than the thing you have </p><p>done for me. So let us put it aside. You are </p><p>a man as I am a man, Muyingwa, and you </p><p>have called me brother. We may speak </p><p>plainly with each other. </p><p> “It is not in my heart to go with you to</p><p>Chebo to become a great man under your </p><p>hand. It is my wish to be what I have al- </p><p>Yahoya </p><p>55 </p><p>ways been, a man free to follow what trail </p><p>he wishes. The trail I must follow leads </p><p>away from you, and back to the world of </p><p>the Bahanas. You must let us go, Yahoya </p><p>and me.” </p><p> Muyingwa stared at him frowning.</p><p>Northrup, looking into the man’s hard eyes, </p><p>felt his heart sink. Yahoya pressed his </p><p>hand softly. </p><p> “We shall be happy even here, Sax-</p><p>northrup!” she whispered. </p><p> Muyingwa silently lifted his hand. A</p><p>dozen of his men came into the main room </p><p>of the kiva. </p><p> “Tell Yellow Beard,” said Muyingwa</p><p>to the man who stood at their head, “what </p><p>are the vows the soldier must take when he </p><p>is no longer a boy, but a man, when the </p><p>Chief Priest and the Overlord of the Seven </p><p>Cities put spear and knife into his hands.” </p><p>The man looked at him curiously as he </p><p>answered: </p><p> “The young soldier swears that in all</p><p>things he will obey blindly the command of </p><p>the captain above him; that he will die be- </p><p>fore he break one of the Five Priestly Orders; </p><p>that torture will not drive him to forget </p><p>what is the chief cause of his people.” </p><p>“Tell him,” went on Muyingwa, “what is </p><p>the oath a soldier must take when he be- </p><p>comes such as I, a head man.” </p><p> “That he will, in all things, obey the com-</p><p>mand of the Overlord; that the Five Priestly </p><p>Orders are supreme in his heart; that though </p><p>the gods themselves commanded he would </p><p>not forget the chief cause of his people.” </p><p>“Tell him,” said Muyingwa, “what is this </p><p>chief cause of our people.” </p><p> “It is this,” answered the man: “There</p><p>shall come among us no Bahana to despoil </p><p>our empire. If a Bahana come he shall be </p><p>as a prisoner among us; and above all </p><p>things, no Bahana shall go forth from us to </p><p>talk of what he has seen.” </p><p> “You hear, Yellow Beard?” demanded</p><p>Muyingwa, his tone seeming suddenly to </p><p>have grown savage.</p><p> “I hear,” answered Northrup.</p><p> “Then,” cried Muyingwa, so that the</p><p>sound of his voice reverberated strangely in </p><p>the stone room, “hear what Muyingwa says </p><p>to you! Before Muyingwa there may be </p><p>great riches and honor, or there may be </p><p>death. Today you saved Muyingwa’s life, </p><p>and he used great words of his gratitude to </p><p>you. He called you brother. Now it is in </p><p>your heart to go back to your own people. </p><p>What is my answer? You are a man as I am </p><p>a man. You love a maiden as I love a </p><p>maiden. I have said ‘Brother’ to you! </p><p>Here is my word: </p><p> “You are no liar as was the Man of Wis-</p><p>dom. Tell me that you will tell no living </p><p>man the way to come upon the people of the </p><p>Seven Cities, and I will believe you. I will </p><p>go with you, you and Yahoya, across the </p><p>desert, leaving Inaa to spin what lies he </p><p>likes in the ear of the Overlord. I will </p><p>bring my men with us, bearing in their </p><p>hands things of gold, to make a great lord </p><p>of you in your own land. And then I will </p><p>leave you and come back to what awaits me </p><p>in Chebo. When Muyingwa says ‘Brother,’ </p><p>it is with his heart.” </p><p> Northrup stepped forward swiftly, his</p><p>breast swelling deeply to the emotion burst- </p><p>ing from his heart, his eyes shining, his </p><p>hand shutting hard, hard upon the hand of </p><p>Muyingwa. </p><p> “What you ask, I promise,” he said sim-</p><p>ply. “I give you my word—Brother!” </p><p> For a moment these two strong men, who</p><p>in verity had come from the ends of the </p><p>earth, stood, hands locked, looking deeply </p><p>into each other’s eyes. And as the two </p><p>hands fell away, through the stillness of the </p><p>room could be heard Northrup’s sigh and </p><p>Muyingwa’s as one. </p><p> “It is better,” whispered little Nayangap,</p><p>“to be a man than a god!” </p><p> Yahoya slipped swiftly to her feet, came</p><p>to Muyingwa’s side, and lifted his hand to </p><p>her lips. Her eyes were bright, and there </p><p>was the glitter of tears in them. </p><p> “You are a man of a great heart,” she</p><p>cried softly. “For does not Yahoya know </p><p>that in Chebo you will have to stand trial </p><p>before the Overlord for the thing which you </p><p>have done? That Inaa, whose power is </p><p>great, will cry loudly for your death? That </p><p>only if Muyingwa’s power has grown in the </p><p>night and he has the secret ear of Kish- </p><p>Taka will death be averted?” </p><p> “Muyingwa is not without power,” was</p><p>the calm answer. “Not without favor in the </p><p>eyes of Kish-Taka, the Overlord. And </p><p>Muyingwa is not a coward.” </p><p>THERE came a star-filled night </p><p>when Muyingwa’s tall form, leading </p><p>his men, was turned away from them </p><p>as he slowly moved back into the desert </p><p>toward the hidden cities. Northrup and </p><p>Yahoya, standing side by side, watched </p><p>Adventure </p><p>56 </p><p>him until at last the night swallowed him. </p><p> At the foot of a great mesquite were buried</p><p>in the sand the things which Muyingwa’s </p><p>men had brought from the place of the </p><p>People of the Hidden Spring, many things </p><p>of heavy gold. To-morrow Northrup would </p><p>come back here for them. Now they had </p><p>passed out of his thought. </p><p> “For there is a thing greater than gold!”</p><p>he whispered, as he opened his arms for her. </p><p>“And we have found it, Yahoya.” </p><p> So as Muyingwa turned back to seek</p><p>that which lay in the future for him, Sax </p><p>Northrup and Yahoya turned their eyes </p><p>toward the shadowy outlines of their own </p><p>dreamings. </p><p>Author of “In the Bank Fog," “The Education of Billy Stream," etc. </p><p>HE halibut fishing-schooner Leona </p><p>T. Himmelman of Anchorville, </p><p>Nova Scotia, was jogging in a </p><p>dense fog a few miles to the </p><p>eastward of Cape Observation, Island of </p><p>Anticosti. The skipper, Johnny Himmel- </p><p>man, had been looking for the fish all </p><p>the way from West Point and had an idea </p><p>that halibut might be struck in the deep </p><p>water on the north shore of the island. </p><p> The Leona T. Himmelman was a ninety-</p><p>five-ton semi-knockabout schooner carry- </p><p>ing eight double-trawl dories and a crew of </p><p>nineteen men. The skipper and a few </p><p>members of the crew hailed from Lunen- </p><p>burg County, which accounted for his </p><p>Teutonic name. </p><p> Captain Johnny could speak German</p><p>and had a taste for certain German dishes </p><p>—sauerkraut being one of them. Though </p><p>German in origin, and retaining many of </p><p> the old German tastes and ideas, Captain</p><p>Himmelman was a Canadian first, last and </p><p>all the time, and his eldest son, Corporal </p><p>Roy Himmelman, was even then in France, </p><p>fighting the Empire’s battle in the ranks of </p><p>the First Canadian Expeditionary Force. </p><p> With her jumbo weathered up, the main-</p><p>sheet started and the wheel down a spoke</p><p>or two, the schooner swashed lazily over </p><p>the fog-shrouded sea, marking time until </p><p>the morning, when the dories would be </p><p>swung over and a “set” made for the val- </p><p>uable flat fish. On deck, the two fisher- </p><p>men on watch smoked and lolled against </p><p>the lee nest of dories. They did not bother </p><p>sounding the mechanical fog-horn, as traffic </p><p>on the north shore of Anticosti was scarce, </p><p>being but rarely navigated by any other </p><p>craft than fishing-vessels. </p><p> Below in the cabin, the skipper and some</p><p>other members of the crew read old Halifax </p><p>Some Fishing </p><p>57 </p><p> papers and discussed the all-absorbing topic</p><p>of the war. </p><p> “I cal’late dat feller of mine will be in</p><p>der trenches now,” remarked the skipper, </p><p>puffing away at his pipe. “I got a card </p><p>from him marked ‘Somewhere in France.’ ” </p><p>“He ain’t seen nawthin’ o’ them sub- </p><p>marines, has he?” queried a fisherman, </p><p>busy overhauling a skate of halibut gear. </p><p> “Said der transport was chased by one</p><p>o’ dem off der Irish coast,” answered Cap- </p><p>tain Johnny, “but der navy boats chased </p><p>der submarine away.” </p><p> “Ain’t they the divil now, them sub-</p><p>marines!” said another. “They say they </p><p>kin travel acrost th’ Western Ocean an’ </p><p>back an’ stay fur days under water. How </p><p>d’ye s’pose they kin cotch them beggars?” </p><p>“Shoot at der periscope, I cal’late,” re- </p><p>plied the skipper, “or ram dem. I cal’late </p><p>dat’s de only way mit dem.” </p><p> “It’s a wonder none o’ them comes acrost</p><p>to this here gulf an’ lays for th’ Montreal </p><p>boats cornin’ out with th’ sojers aboard. </p><p>Ef they kin travel th’ distance they say </p><p>they kin, why don’t they?” </p><p> “They’d need more gasoline to take</p><p>them back,” said a fisherman, looking up </p><p>from the newspaper he was reading. “They </p><p>kin only carry ile enough to bring them </p><p>out-” </p><p> An oilskinned figure appeared in the</p><p>gangway. </p><p> “Say, Skip, fur th’ love o’ Mike, hev a</p><p>look up here! There’s a bloomin’ spar- </p><p>buoy or somethin’ headin’ agin th’ tide </p><p>off’n th’ starb’d beam. Come up quick!” </p><p>THE skipper and a few of the men </p><p>jumped on deck and stared in the </p><p>direction indicated by the fisher- </p><p>man’s mittened hand. The fog was hang- </p><p>ing heavy over the smooth surface of the </p><p>sea, and about a cable’s length away a small </p><p>gray-colored pole was traveling slowly in </p><p>a westerly direction. </p><p> “It’s movin’ all right,” remarked one of</p><p>the fishermen. “Looks like a spar-” </p><p> “Limb o’ a water-logged tree, I cal’late,”</p><p>said some one sarcastically. </p><p> “Aye, headin’ to wind’ard agin’ th’ tide!”</p><p>countered another. “Use th’ small amount </p><p>o’ brains God give ye.” </p><p> “It’s us that’s movin’—not it,” growled</p><p>the other. “A driftin’ spar-buoy or maybe </p><p>a halibuter’s watch-buoy on the end o’ Ms </p><p>gear.” </p><p> The object was vanishing from sight in</p><p>the mist when the skipper, who had been </p><p>staring at it through his marine glasses, </p><p>suddenly exclaimed: </p><p> “Bubbles! A reg’lar wake an’ der bub-</p><p>bles! By yiminy, boys, dat’s der peri- </p><p>scope of a blasted Yerman submarine!” </p><p> All hands were on deck now, staring into</p><p>the fog, and for a minute no one spoke. A </p><p>German submarine in the Gulf of St. Law- </p><p>rence! It was incredible! The simple- </p><p>minded Canadian fishermen, plying their </p><p>vocation on the waters off that deserted </p><p>Anticosti shore, could scarce believe that </p><p>one of the enemy’s deadly engines of war </p><p>would venture across the Atlantic to these </p><p>peaceful waters so remote from the pre- </p><p>scribed area of submarine warfare. </p><p> “What’s her business here?” A husky</p><p>fisherman broke the silence. </p><p> “Layin’ for th’ Montreal troopships, I</p><p>cal’late!” </p><p> “Sufferin’ Judas!” growled a New Bruns-</p><p>wick man. “I hev a brother in one o’ them </p><p>Montreal kilty regiments leavin’ soon. </p><p>What’ll we do, Skip?” </p><p> The smoke was coming from Johnny</p><p>Himmelman’s pipe in a veritable cloud, a </p><p>sure sign that he was thinking. </p><p> “Dere’s a telegraph at Natashkwan an’</p><p>dat’s ’bout fifty miles to de no’theast. </p><p>Fox Bay’s ’bout de same to der east’ard. </p><p>Mit der engine goin’ we kin make eider o’ </p><p>dem in ’bout eight hours-” </p><p> “Here’s a vessel cornin’,” cried a man</p><p>standing for’ard. </p><p> “A warship, by Jupiter!” shouted some</p><p>one. “She’s chasin’ th’ submarine, I’ll </p><p>bet.” </p><p> The pulsating of engines throbbed across</p><p>the water and the fishermen peered into </p><p>the mist excitedly. </p><p> “Thar she is!”</p><p> A shadowy hull loomed out of the pall</p><p>and masts and spars broke into hazy view. </p><p>The sight of a bowsprit, with a trio of furled </p><p>jibs lying upon it, caused the skipper to </p><p>speak in surprise. </p><p> “What der defil! Dat ain’t no warship.</p><p>Dat’s a t’ree-mast, tops’l schooner mit an </p><p>auxiliary engine-” </p><p> “Look’s like a Frenchman from Sint-</p><p>Malo. What’s one o’ them craft adoin’ </p><p>up here? They’re Grand Bank craft— </p><p>By Jupiter! He’ll be into us! Hi-yi! </p><p>Sheer off, you!” </p><p> A bull-roared shout of Warning came</p><p>58 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>from all hands on the Leona Hitntnelman’s </p><p>decks, as the skipper sprang for the wheel </p><p>and hove it up. </p><p> “Draw away der yumbo!” he bawled, as</p><p>the other craft drove down on their port </p><p>bow. </p><p> The lookout on the other vessel must</p><p>have seen them. A guttural shout came </p><p>from her forecastlehead. Their wheel was </p><p>put hard aport, and the big schooner, her </p><p>decks crowded with men and dories, forged </p><p>past the Canadian fishing-vessel, but a </p><p>scant twelve feet between them. </p><p> “Sacre'” shouted a voice. “Why t’-</p><p>ain’t you soundin’ der horn? - An- </p><p>glais!” </p><p> “What vessel’s dat?” roared Himmelman.</p><p>“Schooner Yuno of Fecamp, cod-fishing. </p><p>Who’s dat vessel?” </p><p> “Leona T. Himmelman of Anchorville,</p><p>halibuting. See any halibuters to de </p><p>east’ard?” </p><p> “Yaw!” came the voice out of the fog,</p><p>as the larger vessel swept by. </p><p> “Two or t’ree schooners fishing off Heath</p><p>Point. All revoir, m’sieul” </p><p> Captain Himmelman stared abstractedly</p><p>into the wall of mist which swallowed up </p><p>the Frenchman. Scratching his head won- </p><p>deringly, he inquired of the gang loafing </p><p>around: </p><p> “Did any of you fellers read der name</p><p>of dat craft as he went past?” </p><p> “Aye,” answered a fisherman. “‘Juno</p><p>of Fecamp’ was on her stern board. Didn’t </p><p>ye hear him sing out her name? I c’d hear </p><p>him plain enough.” </p><p> “Yah, I heard him,” answered the skip-</p><p>per slowly. “But he said ‘Yuno’ instead </p><p>of ‘Yuno:" </p><p> “You’re Dutch, Skipper,” laughed the</p><p>other. “You mean he said ‘Yuno’ instead</p><p>of ‘Juno.’ ” </p><p> “Aye, yust so,” replied Himmelman.</p><p>“I’m Dutch and can’t pronounce my yays </p><p>—I cal’late dat oder feller was Dutch too. </p><p>A Frenchman ain’t a ‘yaw-for-yes man.’ </p><p>When dat feller first sighted us under his </p><p>bows, he sung out ‘hard aport’ in Yerman. </p><p>Boys! I’m a Nova Scotia Dutchman, but </p><p>I	kin spot an old-country Deutscher ten</p><p>faddom away, an’ I’ll bet a dollar to a </p><p>doughnut dat dat French fishin’-craft ain’t </p><p>nawthin’ but a Yerman supply-boat foller- </p><p>ing dat submarine!” </p><p> Fishermen of the deep-sea type are quick</p><p>thinkers, and Captain Johnny Himmelman </p><p>was as smart as any of them. For a few </p><p>minutes he sat on the wheel-box, shrouded </p><p>in a pall of tobacco smoke which rivaled </p><p>the fog for density, and his methodical </p><p>German-Canadian brain arrayed the sus- </p><p>picious facts and evolved a plan of action. </p><p> He had many things to consider. First</p><p>of all he wanted to get his valuable infor- </p><p>mation to the Dominion Government. </p><p>Natashkwan, on the north shore of the </p><p>gulf, fifty miles northeast, was a Govern- </p><p>ment telegraph station. Fox Bay on An- </p><p>ticosti Island was a small lobster cannery </p><p>settlement with a private telephone-wire </p><p>to Heath Point signal-station. At Heath </p><p>Point there was a powerful Marconi ap- </p><p>paratus which could flash the news to the </p><p>mainland or a government patrol boat. </p><p>Fox Bay was also some fifty miles to the </p><p>eastward along the Anticosti shore. </p><p> “Hey ye go, fellers!” he shouted at last.</p><p>“Hook der stays’l halyards on to dat power </p><p>dory and git her over. Put a ten-gallon </p><p>can o’ gasoline in and some water and grub. </p><p>Jack Hanson an’ you, Tom Peters, git in </p><p>an’ make for Fox Bay. See de boss at de </p><p>lobster factory dere an’ telephone to de </p><p>lighthouse at Heath Point. Tell dem dat </p><p>a Yerman submarine and a supply-schooner </p><p>passed along de north shore of de Anticoast </p><p>an’ git dem to send a man-o’-war as quick </p><p>as possible. Away you go, boys. I’ll </p><p>stand to de west’ard an’ look for dem queer </p><p>craft.” </p><p> Within five minutes the power dory was</p><p>hoisted over, and the two fishermen grabbed</p><p>their oilskins and jumped in. A deft turn </p><p>of the fly-wheel and a “So long, fellers!” </p><p>and the little boat puttered into the fog on </p><p>her fifty-mile journey. </p><p> The skipper watched them vanish and</p><p>turned to the waiting gang. </p><p> “Now, boys, we’ll tack ship an’ head to</p><p>de wcst’ard, along shore. Maybe we’ll </p><p>locate dem pirate Yermans.” </p><p> II</p><p>WHEN Captain Himmelman head- </p><p>ed the schooner in the direction the </p><p>submarine and her supposed con- </p><p>sort had taken, he had absolutely no idea </p><p>of a plan of action. Neither he nor the </p><p>gang took into consideration the danger of </p><p>such a step, or had any idea as to what they </p><p>would do should they discover the enemy </p><p>craft. As a fisherman would say, “They </p><p> Hii</p><p>Some Fishing </p><p>59 </p><p>barged along to find out things for them- </p><p>selves.” </p><p> The wind was westerly and freshening,</p><p>and with the four lowers, the balloon jib </p><p>and the big fisherman’s staysail set, they </p><p>swung close-hauled up the coast within a </p><p>mile or two of the fog-shrouded land. </p><p>Over the windlass lolled a group of men, </p><p>smoking and conjecturing. Aft at the </p><p>wheel, the skipper glanced alternately at </p><p>sails and compass and blew mighty clouds </p><p>of smoke. The loafing trawlers refrained </p><p>from curious questions and left the skipper </p><p>to his thoughts. </p><p> “Keep a good lookout for’ard, fellers,”</p><p>cautioned Himmelman after a while. </p><p>“Look an’ listen. We don’t want to pass </p><p>dem in de fog.” </p><p> They held on through the mist and</p><p>passed Cape Observation, by soundings, </p><p>about five in the afternoon. Supper was </p><p>a hastily gobbled meal that evening, as </p><p>most of the gang preferred to be on deck </p><p>keeping a lookout. By the laughing com- </p><p>ments and remarks passed among the men, </p><p>one would imagine they were out on a pic- </p><p>nic instead of looking for a German sub- </p><p>marine. One significant aspect, however, </p><p>was the sight of four fishermen seated on </p><p>the house aft and busy oiling and cleaning </p><p>two double-barreled shot-guns, a Win- </p><p>chester “thirty-thirty” and an old Snider </p><p>rifle of the make sold extensively in rural </p><p>localities for five dollars. </p><p> The god Chance threw them across the</p><p>track of their quarry with a suddenness </p><p>which was almost startling. The mist </p><p>lifted landward and disclosed the topsail </p><p>schooner and the under-water boat lying, </p><p>side by side, a cable’s length away on the </p><p>Leona Himmelman’s port quarter. </p><p> “Thar she is!” roared a dozen voices at</p><p>once, and as their excited shouts carried </p><p>across the water, the topsail schooner </p><p>started her engine and sheered away from </p><p>the huge submersible. </p><p> “Stand by der sheets!” bawled Himmel-</p><p>man excitedly. “Swing her off!” </p><p> The gang jumped to bitt and cleat, vague-</p><p>ly wondering what the skipper intended to </p><p>do. The wheel was being rolled up by the </p><p>great hands of Himmelman, and the able </p><p>schooner was paying off rapidly. </p><p> “Stand by for a yibe!” he almost howled.</p><p> “What are ye goin’ to do. Skip?” cried</p><p>the crowd from their various stations. </p><p>“Runnin’ for it?” </p><p> “Run be--!” answered the Lunen-</p><p>burger, his face ablaze with excitement. </p><p>“I’m agoin’ to ram dat dere submarine. </p><p>Let der sheets run and hang on when I hit </p><p>him, for, by yiminy, we’ll hit hard!” </p><p> Crash! The booms came over and</p><p>fetched up on the patent j:bers with the </p><p>shock incidental to jibing all standing in a </p><p>fresh breeze; shouting and cursing men </p><p>caught the turns on the sheets, and as the </p><p>schooner drove for the submarine with the </p><p>big mainboom over the port rail and the </p><p>foreboom over the starboard, the men </p><p>cleaning the guns commenced slipping in </p><p>cartridges and banging away at the sub- </p><p>mersible’s crew hastily scrambling into the </p><p>conning-tower amidships. </p><p> They had good reason to be afraid. A</p><p>ninety-five-ton fishing-schooner, with her </p><p>great sails bellying iron hard with a strong </p><p>breeze and a welter of white water roaring </p><p>up from under her bows, is an awesome </p><p>sight. </p><p> The great spars towering aloft for one</p><p>hundred and twenty-five feet and clothed </p><p>with canvas from topmast truck to deck </p><p>constitutes a formidable driving-power to </p><p>a deep hull laden with forty-five tons of </p><p>ballast and fifty tons of ice, salt and fish. </p><p>The German raiders sensed it, and no </p><p>sooner was the last man below and the </p><p>conning-tower hatch clamped, than the </p><p>great war-fis! i began to dive. </p><p> “She’s divin’, Skip!” yelled Tommy</p><p>Morrissey from forward. </p><p> The rifles and shot-guns kept a continual</p><p>fusillade on the turret which was beginning </p><p>to disappear from sight into a swirl of </p><p>water; the schooner drove ahead at a </p><p>twelve-knot clip, a thing of life, eager and</p><p>vengeful, ready to smash her storming </p><p>stem on the fragile cylinder sinking into </p><p>the sea under her bows. </p><p> Twenty feet! The conning-tower had</p><p>vanished leaving only the periscope, an air </p><p>pipe and two steel wireless masts above </p><p>water. Ten feet! These also disappeared </p><p>and the fishermen on the Leona Himmel- </p><p>man’s decks howled and squirmed with </p><p>disappointed rage. The schooner stormed </p><p>over the great vortex of the submarine’s </p><p>displacement and the men swore, shook </p><p>their clenched fists and yelled meaningless </p><p>expressions with the savagery of primeval </p><p>man cheated of his prey. </p><p> All but Tommy Morrissey. Tommy</p><p>kept his head, like the long-sighted old </p><p>6o </p><p>Adventure </p><p>trawler that he was, and as the schooner </p><p>surged for the vanished under-sea boat, he </p><p>deftly cast the shank painter of the star- </p><p>board anchor adrift, severed the ring stop- </p><p>per with a shack knife and leaped for the </p><p>butt of the bowsprit as the great seven- </p><p>hundred - pound anchor crashed for the </p><p>bottom with thirty fathom of chain cable </p><p>thundering through the hawse-pipe. </p><p> Instinctively the gang ran aft or jumped</p><p>feet first down into the forecastle. The </p><p>schooner fetched up in her headlong career </p><p>with a terrific jerk, and with tremendous </p><p>cracks both masts snapped at the deck and </p><p>the spars hurtled down in a welter of twang- </p><p>ing wire stays and thunderously flapping </p><p>canvas. </p><p> Himmelman, crouching down by the</p><p>wheel, caught sight of Morrissey crawling </p><p>out from the protection of the bowsprit </p><p>butt, and he raced forward, leaping over </p><p>the wreckage with fists clenched. ■&gt; </p><p> “You infernal swab!” he yelled. “What</p><p>dit you mean by dat crazy trick?” </p><p> Morrissey glanced over the bows, noted</p><p>something, and closed with the infuriated </p><p>skipper. </p><p> With the old fisherman’s arms around</p><p>him, Himmelman struggled to plant a </p><p>blow. “I’ll murder you,” he screamed. </p><p>“You-” </p><p> “Easy, Skip! Go easy!” shouted the</p><p>other without relaxing his bear’s hug. </p><p>“Can’t you see, you crazy Dutchman? </p><p>She’s bein’ towed, you fool! She’s bein’ </p><p>towed! Can’t ye understand, or will I </p><p>have to bash some sense inter yer thick </p><p>nut? The anchor’s hooked inter that </p><p>gaudy submarine. That’s why I cast her </p><p>adrift!” </p><p> The skipper jumped for the rail and</p><p>looked over. A ripple played around the </p><p>Leona’s bows and the chain cable led out </p><p>straight ahead. He stared at the con- </p><p>vincing sight for several seconds and turned </p><p>slowly to the triumphant Morrissey. </p><p> “Waal, by yiminy!” he ejaculated. “If</p><p>dat don’t beat all my goin’ afishin’! She’s </p><p>hooked for sure. Swamp me, if dat ain’t </p><p>th’ queerest goldarned fish I ever hooked </p><p>in all my days-an’ mit de anchor for a </p><p>hook. Sink me!” </p><p>ALL hands speedily made their </p><p>way forward to satisfy themselves </p><p>that Morrissey’s claim was correct, </p><p>and the increasing gurgle of the bow wave </p><p>and the chain cable straightening out ahead </p><p>soon convinced them. </p><p> “By golly!” remarked the skipper.</p><p>“Funny thing dat we should have had dat </p><p>range of chain over de windlass, all ready. </p><p>I was for anchoring tonight, but when she </p><p>started breezing up I changed my mind. </p><p>Boys, ye’d better clear away dis raffle. </p><p>Lash dem spars an’ we’ll tow dem astern. </p><p>Cut de sails adrift and fetch dem aboard. </p><p>Yiminy! She’s smashed up dem rails and </p><p>stanchions in good shape. Git busy nowl” </p><p>With feverish haste, the men cut and </p><p>slashed the spars clear of the encumbering </p><p>rigging and sails, and bending on warps </p><p>allowed the mainmast, foremast and main- </p><p>boom to tow astern. The lighter gaffs and </p><p>booms were kept on deck. </p><p> Himmelman gazed over the taffrail with</p><p>a glance of approval. </p><p> “Dey will help to make Us tow harder.</p><p>Ha! ha!” </p><p> The submarine was still submerged and</p><p>hauling the dismasted fishing - schooner </p><p>along at a speed of four or five knots. The </p><p>topsail schooner had vanished into a wall </p><p>of fog which still hung over the water to </p><p>seaward. </p><p> “That under-water craft’ll be for cornin’</p><p>up an’ havin’ a look ’round soon,” remarked </p><p>a fisherman apprehensively. “What are </p><p>we agoin’ to do then?” </p><p> “What ef she does?” growled another.</p><p>“What kin she do? She can’t git adrift </p><p>from us. That seven-hunder-pound an- </p><p>chor’ll hev bitten well inter some part o’ </p><p>her top deck. Them flukes’ll go through </p><p>thin steel easy and th’ way o’ this vessel </p><p>under sail ’ud make them bite for further</p><p>orders. That anchor’s fast for keeps. Th’ </p><p>way she fetched up an’ jumped th’ spars </p><p>out ’ud tell ye that-” </p><p> “Aye, that may be so, but s’pose that</p><p>there submarine starts to dive deeper an* </p><p>drag this here hooker under?” </p><p> “Yes! And ef she did we’d moor her</p><p>for all time soon’s we filled an’ sunk. We </p><p>c’d batten down an’ we couldn’t be sunk. </p><p>’Sides, that submarine ain’t strong enough </p><p>to drag this craft down.” </p><p> “S’pose she comes up alongside an’ tries</p><p>to board us? What then?” </p><p>“We got guns, ain’t we? They kin only </p><p>crawl out that connin’-tower one at a time, </p><p>an’ I cal’late we c’d pick ’em off nicely.” </p><p>“By Jupiter!” broke in Morrissey. </p><p>“They might try an’ loose a torpedo at us. </p><p>Some Fishing </p><p>61 </p><p>With thirty fathom of chain out, it might </p><p>give him a chanst to swing around an’ give </p><p>us a shot that 'ud blow us to flinders.” </p><p>“For’ard dere, fellers, an’ heave short!” </p><p>yelled the skipper instantly. “Git twenty </p><p>faddom o’ dat cable aboard, quick!” </p><p> The crowd had the brakes shipped and</p><p>were windlassing in the links ere the words </p><p>were out of Himmelman’s mouth. Never </p><p>did men heave down on windlass bars with </p><p>such efforts as did the Leona’s gang. The </p><p>most exacting Yankee wind-jammer mate </p><p>could not have roused a homeward-bound- </p><p>er’s mud-hook aboard in quicker time. </p><p> Panting and sweating, they clustered in</p><p>the waist and gazed at the bubbling wake </p><p>ahead. The skipper had his pipe going </p><p>again and was busy thinking, with the </p><p>wheel in his hands. The submarine was </p><p>towing them to the eastward, just the </p><p>direction that Himmelman wanted. </p><p> “She’s a-comin’ up, Skip!” cried a man,</p><p>pointing ahead to where the periscope was </p><p>emerging from the water. </p><p> Himmelman laughed and gave the wheel</p><p>a savage wrench. </p><p> “We’ll steer wild,” he said easily, “and</p><p>give him some drag—Yiminy!” </p><p> A terrific explosion shook the vessel, and</p><p>the fishermen were thrown to the deck. </p><p>Splinters of wood flew high into the air </p><p>followed by a tower of water which came </p><p>like a cloudburst from aloft and almost </p><p>swamped the dismasted Leona. The at- </p><p>mosphere reeked with the acrid fumes of a </p><p>high explosive. </p><p> “Holy mackerel!” cried the gang as they</p><p>scrambled to their feet, almost deafened </p><p>and blinded by the shock. “We’re tor- </p><p>pedoed!” </p><p> The water was sluicing off the schooner’s</p><p>smashed decks, and the skipper looked </p><p>around. </p><p> “De vessel ain’t hit!” he cried. “It’s</p><p>de spars towin’ astern—Yudas! He’s shot </p><p>a torpedo out of his stern and it missed us</p><p>when I give her de wheel dat time. Haul </p><p>up on him, fellers, or, by Yupiter, he’ll be </p><p>givin’ us anoder! Yump, fellers, yump! </p><p>Shoot away dat periscope, somebody!” </p><p> The crowd ran for the windlass brakes</p><p>and plied them desperately, while Dexter </p><p>Anson plumped five thirty-thirty bullets </p><p>into the head of the periscope. At such </p><p>close range, the mirrors were effectually </p><p>smashed and the U-boat was rendered </p><p>helpless as an under-water menace. </p><p> Slowly but surely, with fifteen husky</p><p>men on the windlass brakes, the chain came </p><p>in link by link until the fishermen could </p><p>discern the black bulk of the submarine in </p><p>the clear green water ahead. Its propellers </p><p>were churning up the water almost under </p><p>the bowsprit of the fishing-schooner. </p><p> “They cal’late they’ve blown us up,”</p><p>remarked Morrissey sagely, “so, with that </p><p>perryscope out o’ business, they’ll come </p><p>out for a look. They kin see through them </p><p>glass ports in that there turret. Thar she </p><p>comes now—jest like a whale. See ef ye </p><p>can put some shots through them glass </p><p>ports, Dexter.” </p><p> The fisherman with the rifle took care-</p><p>ful aim and fired, and the submarine dived </p><p>again. </p><p> “I cal’late we got him jammed in a</p><p>clinch!” joyously ejaculated Morrissey, as </p><p>he watched the great steel hull subside. </p><p>“We’ve got that there fish poke-hooked, </p><p>by Godfrey! He can’t do nawthin’ no- </p><p>how but drag us to blaze-an-gone-out acrost </p><p>to Dutchland.” </p><p> “That’s just th’ divil of it,” remarked</p><p>the cook. “Ain’t we got no way of stop- </p><p>pin’ him? He’s liable to tow us off some- </p><p>wheres an’ we’ll miss th’ man-o’-war that </p><p>th’ boys hev gone to Fox Bay to fctch.” </p><p>“By golly, but de cook’s right!’-’ said </p><p>the skipper. “We’ll have to stop dat </p><p>beggar somehow-” </p><p> “You bet we will!” interrupted Dexter</p><p>Anson dolefully. “I ain’t got no more </p><p>cartridges left. Thar’s no more ammu- </p><p>nition but three number sixes for the shot- </p><p>guns, and ef them Germans take a notion </p><p>to come up and open fire on us, we’re done</p><p>for.” </p><p> The ingenious Morrissey smashed his</p><p>great fist on the staysail box. </p><p> “Boys,” said he triumphantly, “I’ve an</p><p>idea that I cal’late will work. I’ll git them </p><p>jibsheet chains and crawl out on th’ bow- </p><p>split. You fellers heave ahead on that </p><p>windlass and I’ll drop them chains inter his </p><p>perpellers. Ef that don’t fetch him up, </p><p>I’m a Dutchman myself.” </p><p> Quickly unshackling the sheets from the</p><p>jib, Morrissey made each of them fast to a </p><p>piece of line and crawled out on the bow- </p><p>sprit, with Dexter Anson lugging the chains </p><p>along the foot-ropes. While the rest of </p><p>the gang manned the windlass again, Mor- </p><p>rissey sat astride the bowsprit-end and </p><p>swung the chain as he would heave a lead. </p><p>62 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Anson, on the foot-ropes, held the lines </p><p>already bent to the sheets. </p><p> “Watch, there, watch!” cried Morrissey,</p><p>carefully judging the distance from the spar </p><p>to the boiling froth a few feet ahead of him. </p><p>“Heave!” </p><p> The chain flew from his hands and shot</p><p>into the submarine’s wake. </p><p> “Nawthin’ doin’!” bawled Anson, as he</p><p>felt the weight of the chain on his line. </p><p>“Try again, Tommy, boy!” </p><p> He hove the chain up again and passed</p><p>it along to Morrissey, who made another </p><p>attempt. </p><p> “Must have guards over them wheels,”</p><p>growled he, after four unsuccessful attempts. </p><p>“Haul up on him a bit more, boys! An- </p><p>other fathom ahead and I’ll be able to drop </p><p>’em right down on them screws. Ready? </p><p>Stand by, Dexter. Heave!” </p><p> The fishermen clustered over the bows</p><p>gave vent to an excited shout of triumph </p><p>as the retaining line was whipped out of </p><p>Anson’s hands. </p><p> “She’s fouled!” roared Morrissey.</p><p>“Gimme that other chain for th’ port screw! </p><p>Heave!” </p><p> The watchers held their breath and ex-</p><p>pelled it in a joyous howl as the line almost </p><p>wrenched Anson from his perch. </p><p> “She’s snarled, by the holy old sailor!”</p><p>he yelled as he clutched at the back-rope </p><p>to save himself from falling. “She’s </p><p>stopped.” </p><p> In the midst of their triumph, the skip-</p><p>per gave vent to an excited ejaculation and </p><p>pointed to the sea-line astern. In the glow </p><p>of the sunset, the square sails of a sailing- </p><p>vessel were silhouetted some five miles </p><p>away. </p><p> “Dat tops’l schooner!” he cried. “An’</p><p>she’s headin’ for us. We’ll have to beat it!” </p><p> “Beat it?” questioned the gang.</p><p> “Yes, beat it, an’ - quick. Dere’s</p><p>’bout t'irty men aboard dat craft an’ dey </p><p>may have guns.” </p><p> “What about this here submarine? Will</p><p>we cut her adrift?” </p><p> The skipper thought for a moment.</p><p> “No! We’ll moor her. Knock out the</p><p>first shackle on that chain cable abaft the </p><p>windlass and bend de fishin’ hawser and de </p><p>port anchor to it. When we’re ready we’ll </p><p>let go, and Mister Submarine will be moored </p><p>to t’ree hundred faddom of good eight-inch </p><p>manila hawser and an eight-hundred-pound </p><p>anchor. He’ll hang to dis forty-faddom </p><p>water for all time even ef he clears dose </p><p>chains from his screws. Billy, go down </p><p>aft and start de engine. We’ll have to git </p><p>out quick!” </p><p>THE bleak shore of northern An- </p><p>ticosti was about two miles away </p><p>and the sun was setting. It was </p><p>hazy to the eastward and nothing broke </p><p>the sea line but the somber shores of </p><p>the island and the rapidly approaching </p><p>schooner. </p><p> “All ready for’ard?” shouted Himmel-</p><p>man from the wheel. </p><p> “All ready, Skipper!”</p><p> “Den let her go!”</p><p> The men had bent the chain of the an-</p><p>chor which was fast to the U-boat to the </p><p>cable of the Banker’s fishing-anchor and </p><p>with a heave of the fluke bar sent the big </p><p>mud-hook crashing to the bottom with the </p><p>great fishing hawser snaking out after it. </p><p>The chain cable was clear of the windlass </p><p>and with engine going, the dismasted fish- </p><p>ing-schooner backed away from the still </p><p>submerged submarine. </p><p> “She’s moored for fair, now, Skip!” re-</p><p>marked a man. “Lord Harry, but we’ve </p><p>had some fun this afternoon! Ha, ha!” </p><p> As they sheered off, the rugged fisher-</p><p>men gave vent to expressions of relief. </p><p> “Some fishing!” they said gleefully.</p><p>“Won’t Jack Hanson an’ Tom Peters be </p><p>sore at missing this day’s sport?” </p><p> As they drew away, the submarine slow-</p><p>ly emerged to the surface. A man crawled </p><p>out of her conning-tower, followed by three </p><p>or four others. A forward hatch also </p><p>opened and the submarine’s decks were </p><p>crowded with men who shouted and shook </p><p>their fists at the retreating fishing-schooner. </p><p> Suddenly a disappearing gun elevated</p><p>itself from the submersible’s decks; two </p><p>men swung the muzzle around; there was </p><p>a flash of fire in the twilight and a shell </p><p>struck the Leona forward by the windlass </p><p>and exploded with a stunning detonation. </p><p>Luckily all hands were mustered aft and </p><p>flopped to the deck as soon as they saw the </p><p>gun. </p><p> Bang! Another shell struck the stump</p><p>of the foremast and blew the forecastle </p><p>hatch into a mess of splintered and shred- </p><p>ded wood. </p><p> “Holy mackerel!” cried a man anxiously.</p><p>“There’s agoin’ to be some killin’ yet. </p><p>What are we agoin’ to do, Skip?” </p><p>Some Fishing </p><p>63 </p><p> “Kin we run for it?” inquired Morrissey</p><p>looking at the skipper. </p><p> Craslil A shell struck the rail amidships</p><p>and tore the gunwales off the dory on the </p><p>port nest. </p><p> “Lord Harry, Skipper!” shouted the</p><p>crowd in a panic. “We’re agoin’ to git </p><p>killed!” </p><p> Himmelman’s usually placid face was</p><p>white now. He wasn’t afraid, but he was </p><p>mad—berserker mad. Rolling the wheel </p><p>over, he swung the Leona around on her </p><p>heel and headed for the submarine. </p><p> “Gedt down, boys, down on der deck!”</p><p>he shouted, relapsing in his excitement into </p><p>broken English and German. “I’ll finish </p><p>dot feller, by-!” </p><p> Plunkl A shot struck the water astern</p><p>of them as the schooner forged ahead at </p><p>eight knots under the drive of the powerful </p><p>auxiliary gasoline engine. A continuous </p><p>fire of gun and rifle shots was coming from </p><p>the submarine’s crew now and the bullets </p><p>bit into the solid woodwork of the rails and </p><p>houses and scattered splinters over the </p><p>crouching fishermen. The shells went </p><p>whistling over the vessel, but in the gath- </p><p>ering darkness, with the target rapidly </p><p>approaching and bows on, the German </p><p>gunners were shooting wild. </p><p> A rifle bullet knocked the skipper’s cap</p><p>off and plowed a furrow across his scalp. </p><p>The blood poured down his face and he </p><p>dropped down by the wheel. </p><p> “Head her for dat turret amidships,” he</p><p>growled, dashing the blood out of his eyes </p><p>with his great fist. </p><p> Morrissey and Anson knelt by the wheel</p><p>and glanced over the bows to where the </p><p>submarine lay. It was only fifty yards </p><p>away now and the fire was slacking off. </p><p>The submarine’s crew were preparing for </p><p>an abandonment of their craft and were </p><p>buckling on life-belts ready for a swim to </p><p>the three-mast schooner which was rapidly </p><p>coming up. </p><p> “Stand by!” yelled some one.</p><p> The fishermen leaped to their feet with a</p><p>wild whoop and hurled belaying-pins, coal, </p><p>pieces of wood and other missiles at the </p><p>German sailors, as with a staggering crash </p><p>the schooner rammed the U-boat amid- </p><p>ships. </p><p> The force of the blow rolled the great</p><p>cigar-shaped hull over. A few of the Ger- </p><p>mans were knocked into the sea; others </p><p>hung to the hand-rails and opened fire with </p><p>automatic revolvers, and two made a leap </p><p>for the schooner’s bobstays and scrambled </p><p>aboard, only to be laid out by windlass </p><p>bars in the hands of the maddened fisher- </p><p>men. </p><p> With her engine still going ahead and</p><p>her bow rammed against the submarine’s </p><p>turret, the Leona held the underwater craft </p><p>over on her side. Some of the crew re- </p><p>mained hanging to the hand-rails, firing </p><p>with revolvers at the black bulk of the </p><p>fishing-vessel, but as it was dark, the </p><p>shooting was largely pot-luck shots. On </p><p>the Leona, the gang kept up a continuous </p><p>bombardment with whatever missiles they </p><p>could lay their hands on, and dory water- </p><p>jars burst like shrapnel on the iron decks </p><p>of the U-boat. </p><p> “More ammunition!” yelled Morrissey,</p><p>and the cook jumped below and threw his </p><p>pots and pans up through the splintered </p><p>forecastle hatch. </p><p> The top-sail schooner had come up with-</p><p>in a hundred yards by now and was launch- </p><p>ing her dories. </p><p> “Look, Skip!” cried Dexter Anson.</p><p>“There’s eight dories full o’ men acomin’ </p><p>for us. I cal’late you’d better reverse that </p><p>engine an’ git out o’ this.” </p><p> Himmelman grasped the clutch and</p><p>hauled it over. The motor, which had </p><p>been going continuously, gave a few ex- </p><p>plosions and stopped. </p><p> “Jump below, Billy, and give her a</p><p>crank!” cried the Skipper, anxiously peer- </p><p>ing into the darkness. </p><p> The fisherman who had charge of the</p><p>engine, jumped below and almost as quick- </p><p>ly appeared again. </p><p> “The gasoline tank’s punctured!” he</p><p>cried in alarm. </p><p> “De-, ye. say! Yiminy! We’re done</p><p>for! Git ready, fellers, to fight for yer </p><p>lives!” </p><p> As he spoke, Billy the engineer ripped</p><p>out an oath and clapped his hand to his </p><p>left shoulder. </p><p> “Jumpin’ Jupiter! I’m hit!”</p><p> From all around them in the darkness</p><p>came the flash and snap of rifle and revol- </p><p>ver fire. </p><p> The crouching fishermen on the Leona</p><p>Himmelman’s shattered and splintered </p><p>decks knew that they need expect no </p><p>mercy from the enraged Germans, and </p><p>each grasped knife, bar and ax and pre- </p><p>pared to sell his life dearly. </p><p>64 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>&amp;&amp; THE operator at Heath Point </p><p>gfe/o Signal Station laughed as he re- </p><p> •	ceived the telephone message from</p><p>Fox Bay. </p><p> “What d’ye think of that?” he said to</p><p>the other two operators. “Some crazy </p><p>fishermen have come into Fox Bay, saying </p><p>they saw a German submarine up on the </p><p>north shore of the island. Seem quite </p><p>excited over it and want us to inform a </p><p>patrol boat or the Government.” </p><p> The others grinned.</p><p> “Wonder where they got the rum? Any-</p><p>way, you’d better flash it over to that de- </p><p>stroyer off here. There’s some troop- </p><p>ships coming down soon and we’d better </p><p>send it, even though it’s only a fisherman’s </p><p>yarn.” </p><p> The operator on duty entered the wire-</p><p>less room and sat down to the key. His </p><p>fingers pressed the dots and dashes de- </p><p>noting the call of the war-vessel some- </p><p>where out in the gulf. </p><p> The connection was made and the wire-</p><p>less man repeated his message, adding— </p><p>“Guess it’s a joke!” </p><p> The reply rather startled him.</p><p> “No joke. Inform Fame Point and all</p><p>stations within your radius. Most im- </p><p>portant. We’re off. Keep your wire clear </p><p>for the next twelve hours.” </p><p> A long slate - colored destroyer slid</p><p>through the haze off East Cape, with smoke </p><p>belching from her three funnels. The </p><p>commander on her bridge talked with his </p><p>senior lieutenant in excited tones. </p><p> “They have done it after all,” he said.</p><p>“We knew they planned getting some of </p><p>their subs over here, but they caught two </p><p>of them in the Channel and we thought </p><p>they’d given up the attempt. Those fish- </p><p>ermen are in Fox Bay, so we’ll haul in and </p><p>pick them up.” </p><p> As they approached the lobster factory</p><p>settlement, the motor dory with Jack </p><p>Hanson and Tom Peters aboard rounded </p><p>up alongside the destroyer. The dory was </p><p>hoisted aboard, and the two fishermen </p><p>were escorted to the bridge. </p><p> The commander questioned them at once.</p><p>“You saw the periscope proceeding in a </p><p>westerly direction. You also saw a three- </p><p>masted schooner, presumably a French </p><p>fisherman, following her. Umphl Up off </p><p>Cape Observation, you say. All right, </p><p>men, if your information turns out to be </p><p>correct, you will have done your country a </p><p>great service—a great service. Better go </p><p>below and have something to eat.” </p><p> “If ye don’t mind, sir, we’d rather stay</p><p>up here an’ watch th’ fun. Holy sailor! </p><p>This craft kin travel some. What kin she </p><p>make, mister?” </p><p> “We’re running at thirty-two knots an</p><p>hour now,” replied the officer with a smile. </p><p>“We can make more—thirty-six. Fog’s </p><p>lifting, thank Heaven.” </p><p> At ten o’clock it was dark and Cape</p><p>Observation was abeam. The fishermen </p><p>lounged in the lee of the canvas dodger, </p><p>while the spray swashed up from the racing </p><p>bows of the destroyer and the wind of their </p><p>passage roared overhead in the aerials of the </p><p>wireless. </p><p> A quartermaster, scanning the horizon</p><p>ahead with binoculars, reported: </p><p> “Something firing ahead, sir. Can make</p><p>out gun flashes!” </p><p> “Hands to stations!” ordered the com-</p><p>mander, and the wondering trawlers noted </p><p>the activity which followed the order. </p><p> Bluejackets scurried into the gun turret</p><p>forward, and at the numerous quick-firers </p><p>along the rail the gun crews hauled the </p><p>canvas covers off and carried ammunition </p><p>boxes. Hanson and Peters were anxious. </p><p> “Gun flashes ahead,” muttered the lat-</p><p>ter. “Cal’late the boys are inter a scrap </p><p>with them fellers. Hope we’re in time to </p><p>prevent any killing scrapes.” </p><p> It was black-dark now and the sky was</p><p>cloudy and devoid of stars. The destroyer </p><p>was forging ahead through the gloom at a </p><p>tremendous speed, her whole fabric trem- </p><p>bling to the drive of her powerful engines. </p><p>The officers peered ahead through their </p><p>glasses. </p><p> “Searchlight!” ordered the commander.</p><p>The dazzling glare cut into the darkness </p><p>like a huge sword. “Sweep the horizon!” </p><p>The great beam of light wheeled and illu- </p><p>minated the deserted scrub-clad cliffs of the </p><p>Anticosti shore, two miles away, and then </p><p>methodically described a searching arc </p><p>from port to starboard. </p><p> “There they are!”</p><p> The light settled on a strange tableau a</p><p>mile away on the starboard bow. A fish- </p><p>ing-schooner, her masts gone, rolled in the </p><p>swell alongside the long black hulk of a </p><p>great submarine. In close proximity was </p><p>a three-mast topsail schooner lying hove- </p><p>to, and all around the three craft were </p><p>dories crowded with men. When the light </p><p>Some Fishing </p><p>65 </p><p>played on the scene, all the dories with </p><p>one accord made for the topsail schooner. </p><p> “Starboard—two points!” The destroy-</p><p>er’s commander, fearing a torpedo from the </p><p>submarine, swung his ship off suddenly. </p><p>“Port—two points!” </p><p> The destroyer made another wild swing</p><p>on her course. </p><p> “Fire a shot over that schooner!”</p><p> A gun thundered below the bridge and</p><p>the destroyer’s whistle shrieked a warning </p><p>to halt. </p><p> “All right. Never mind him. We can</p><p>catch that fellow any time. We’ll come </p><p>alongside that submarine. Looks as if </p><p>there was something wrong with him. By </p><p>Jove! He’s making no move. Swing all </p><p>your guns on him and as soon as I give the </p><p>word, pump shell into him as hard as you </p><p>can go.” </p><p> “By gorry, mister!” ejaculated Hanson,</p><p>“th’ Leona’s in a whale of a mess! She </p><p>ain’t got a spar standin’, an’ her decks are </p><p>all smashed up. Jupiter! Thar ain’t no </p><p>sign o’ th’ gang.” </p><p> Fear for their safety gripped his heart.</p><p>“They’ve bin wiped out!” growled Peters </p><p>ominously. “God, mister, they’ve bin </p><p>killed. Thar ain’t a man on her decks. </p><p>We’re too late!” </p><p> Both fishermen feared the worst, and a</p><p>slow rage consumed them. Peters grabbed </p><p>the commander’s arm. </p><p> “Blow that schooner an’ submarine out</p><p>o’ water, sir!” he cried hoarsely. “Give </p><p>the order to yer men. They’ve wiped out </p><p>Johnny Himmelman and the gang!” </p><p> The officer rang down for “Stop!” and</p><p>shook off the fisherman’s detaining hand. </p><p> “Wait a minute, my man,” he said grim-</p><p>ly. “We’ll investigate. If anything has </p><p>happened to your friends, they’ll be </p><p>avenged. Two boats and a full boarding- </p><p>crew, Mr. Jones! Call them away and</p><p>overhaul that submarine and the fisherman. </p><p>If he tries any monkey tricks, sheer off and </p><p>I’ll sink him. Nothing to fear from that </p><p>schooner—she can’t get away from us, but </p><p>look out they don’t open fire on you with </p><p>rifles or concealed guns. Call your men </p><p>away!” </p><p> A boatswain’s whistle warbled out and</p><p>two boats splashed into the water, with the </p><p>crews swarming down the falls fully armed </p><p>with cutlasses, rifles and revolvers. Peters </p><p>and Hanson ran down from the bridge and </p><p>leaped into the first boat. The oars were </p><p>shipped and with the steady pull of a well- </p><p>trained man-o’-war’s crew, the two boats </p><p>headed rapidly in the direction of the help- </p><p>less fishing-schooner. </p><p> Peters and Hanson were the first men</p><p>over the smashed rails. </p><p> “Lord Harry!” cried Peters. “She’s all</p><p>smashed an’ ripped to blazes!” He ran to </p><p>the cabin gangway. “Oh, below! Any </p><p>one aboard?” Hanson had run for’ard and </p><p>was hailing down the splintered forecastle. </p><p> “Godfrey, Jack, there’s nobody aboard!”</p><p>cried Peters hoarsely. “They’ve bin mur- </p><p>dered and hove overboard! Look at the </p><p>blood on the wheel-box! Look how th’ </p><p>decks hev bin shot up! God—poor boys! </p><p>Poor boys!” </p><p> They reported to the officer in the boat.</p><p> “Nobody aboard, sir. Th’ boys hev</p><p>bin murdered an’ thrown over th’ side by </p><p>them murderin’ devils. Seventeen o’ them, </p><p>sir! As fine a gang as ever hauled a trawl </p><p>or stood a trick-” </p><p> “Jump in, m’lads, and we’ll overhaul</p><p>this submarine,” said the officer kindly. </p><p>“She’s making no move, and I’m thinking </p><p>she’s disabled in some way. We’ll get her </p><p>crew and they’ll pay the price, never fear!” </p><p> Illuminated in the glare of the destroy-</p><p>er’s searchlights, the boats pulled for the </p><p>submarine, which rested motionless on the </p><p>water, with her conning-tower and decks </p><p>just awash. A fisherman’s small trawl- </p><p>anchor bent to a stout line which led to the </p><p>Leona was fluked in the handrail. </p><p> “Now, lads, board her!” shouted the</p><p>lieutenant, as the boats ranged alongside </p><p>the great steel hull. </p><p> The bowmen hooked in with the boat-</p><p>hooks, and the bare-footed bluejackets, </p><p>with cutlasses and revolvers drawn, </p><p>swarmed out on the submersible’s decks. </p><p>The conning-tower hatch was down and </p><p>the lieutenant banged on it with the butt </p><p>of his sword. </p><p> “Open up and surrender!” he roared.</p><p> The hatch opened slowly and a voice</p><p>answered. </p><p> “All right, mister! Der blasted hatch</p><p>was hard to open. Yiminy! You was a </p><p>long time coming.” </p><p> Out of the hatch appeared a haggard</p><p>face with a blood-stained bandage around it. </p><p> “Johnny Himmelman!” howled both the</p><p>fishermen at once. </p><p> The lieutenant and the bluejackets</p><p>stared in surprise as the two trawlers </p><p>66 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>grabbed the skipper and helped him down </p><p>on the submersible’s decks. </p><p> “How in th’ name o’ Moses did you git</p><p>in there? Where’s th’ gang?” </p><p> The gang were coming. The whole seven-</p><p>teen of them came crawling out of the U- </p><p>boat’s conning-tower, and the naval men </p><p>gaped at them open-mouthed. </p><p> “Where the dickens is the crew of this</p><p>craft?” stuttered the lieutenant of Himmel- </p><p>man. </p><p> The skipper waved toward the topsail</p><p>schooner lying to the wind a cable’s length </p><p>away. </p><p> “Aboard her, I cal’late, or in der drink,</p><p>maybe!” he answered nonchalantly. To </p><p>Peters and Hanson he remarked: “Boys, </p><p>oh, boys, but you’ve missed all der fun. </p><p>What a session we’ve had, to be sure!” </p><p> The officer looked over the assembly of</p><p>rugged fishermen—cut, bleeding and bruised. </p><p>He noted their daredevil faces and their </p><p>powerfully muscled arms. </p><p> “By Jove!” he murmured. “What devils</p><p>they are, those Bank fishermen! What </p><p>boys they’d make for the navy! Eh, </p><p>what?” </p><p>THE war is still on and the censor- </p><p>ship is strict. The fate of the sub- </p><p>marine, the topsail schooner and </p><p>her crew, are known only to the naval au- </p><p>thorities. Our story deals only with Cap- </p><p>tain Himmelman and the Leona Himmel- </p><p>man’s gang. </p><p> Captain Johnny was speaking.</p><p> “Yes, sir,” he was saying, “when we saw</p><p>de dories cornin’ for us from dat schooner </p><p>an’ bangin’ away at us mit rifles, I says, </p><p>‘We’ll have to git out!’ De Leona had </p><p>drifted a few feet off from de submarine, </p><p>so we hooked her mit a trawl-anchor and a </p><p>bit o’ line and den we hauled de Leona up </p><p>on it. </p><p> “De whole gang of us scrambled out on</p><p>der bowsplit and yumped aboard der </p><p>submarine and got into her and closed de </p><p>hatch yust as dey rushed us. We were all </p><p>right den—yust as safe as a lobster in a can; </p><p>and we stayed dere ontil de man-o’-war </p><p>come up. Now, mister, I want to know </p><p>if der Government is goin’ to pay for de </p><p>damage to my schooner.” </p><p> The destroyer’s commander smiled and</p><p>stretched forth his hand. </p><p> “Captain Himmelman,” he said with</p><p>admiration in his voice, “we’ve heard of </p><p>nervy deeds done in this great war, but I </p><p>must say that there is little I have heard </p><p>that can beat the exploits of you and your </p><p>daring crew. You recklessly braved death </p><p>a dozen times; you have shown a truly </p><p>marvelous ingenuity in capturing this </p><p>submarine, her crew, and that treacherous </p><p>Portuguese schooner; you have also been </p><p>the means of averting a great peril to the </p><p>flotilla of transports coming down the gulf </p><p>this week. </p><p> I haven’t the least hesitation in stating</p><p>that when I have made my report to </p><p>the authorities, you and your men will </p><p>be fully compensated and rewarded for </p><p>the work you have done and the dangers </p><p>you have faced. Allow me to shake hands </p><p>with you and your brave boys. By God- </p><p>frey! I’m proud to know you!” </p><p> Some months later Captain Himmelman</p><p>proudly exhibited a medal to the visiting </p><p>mayor of Anchorville and members of the </p><p>town council. </p><p> “Yes, sir, me an’ Tommy Morrissey an’</p><p>Dexter Anson got one of dem things mit a </p><p>letter from King George himself. Dey call </p><p>it de ‘Distinguished Sendee Order,’ an’ I </p><p>cal’late I’ll hev it made into a brooch for de </p><p>ol’ woman. De Leona is bein’ refitted at </p><p>de expense of de government, and de whole </p><p>gang got a check from dem, so I cal’late </p><p>we ain’t lost much. I ain’t a highliner </p><p>this season, but we’ve got one thing to brag </p><p>about when it comes to fishin’.” </p><p> “What’s that, Captain?”</p><p> “We’re de only gang dat ever jigged a</p><p>submarine—an’ mit de starb’d anchor for </p><p>a hook. Ha! Ha!” And Captain Him-</p><p>melman chuckled. </p><p>HENCE Paddy came or what his </p><p>past had been are matters of no </p><p>consequence. It is enough that </p><p>the Potter had fashioned him </p><p>crudely and then had cast him into the </p><p>stream to drift as he might. And the god- </p><p>dess of chance, in some caprice, had kept </p><p>the frail jar floating, holding its rim just a </p><p>little above the threatening surface. </p><p> So Paddy, circling about in the buffeting</p><p>eddies of human experience, was carried to </p><p>San Francisco, in the days when thousands </p><p>of troops set forth in great white] ships to </p><p>civilize the Philippine Islands. There, waif </p><p>and wanderer, he followed the crowds, earn- </p><p>ed a meal when he could, and cheered, on </p><p>occasions, as lustily as many a happier </p><p>sportsman. </p><p> At last, impelled by a lofty motive, per-</p><p>haps, but influenced most, I fear, by the </p><p>seductive odor of hot “slum,” sniffed in the </p><p>tented camps—for his belt was very loose </p><p>—he stopped, one day, before a white- </p><p>haired sergeant who stood in an office-door- </p><p>way, and pulled off his battered hat. </p><p> “Want to take on?” the sergeant asked.</p><p> “Wot’s that?” countered Paddy warily.</p><p> “Want to enlist?”</p><p> “Oh! I was thinkin’ of ut,” confessed</p><p>the wanderer. </p><p> The trained old non-com looked sharply</p><p>into the large eyes before him and divined, </p><p>among other things, a cunning brain behind </p><p> them. As for Paddy, he read the sergeant’s</p><p> mind and the sergeant knew it. Then both,</p><p> in perfect understanding, grinned as two</p><p> who had seen the world, and the old man</p><p> said—</p><p> “Come in.”</p><p> This is a part of the record signed by the</p><p> major upstairs:</p><p> Nativity, American. Height, 67 inches.</p><p> Age, 23 1-12. Weight, 132 pounds. Occu-</p><p> pation, track-walker. (Whereat the major</p><p> had smiled and the sergeant had glared</p><p> most soberly at the ceiling.) Figure, thin</p><p> but muscular. Hair, red. Eyes, light blue.</p><p> Complexion, pale. Indelible marks, ears very</p><p> prominent; face badly freckled.</p><p> “My boy,” said the major when the ex-</p><p> amination was over, “you’re a bum and we</p><p> don’t want bums. But you have a keen</p><p> head and a good heart. You don’t know</p><p> much, but you can learn. You’ve seen hard</p><p> times, but there is something around that</p><p> big mouth of yours that tells me you’d</p><p> rather give away all you had than steal</p><p> from others. Your eyes are wide awake and</p><p> shrewd, but you’d rather be honest than</p><p> crooked. If you study hard and work hard</p><p> you can go as high in the service as you like.</p><p> I’ll take you on. Hold up your right hand.”</p><p> And that is how Paddy, at last, began a</p><p> definite career and a great adventure, in</p><p> the course of which he committed a mili-</p><p> tary sin, fought for his life with his wits,</p><p> 67</p><p>68 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>out-Malayed the Malay, rendered his coun- </p><p>try a service and ruined the plans of scores </p><p>of others, but emerged unscathed himself. </p><p>ALL this occurred eight hundred </p><p>miles from Manila, far in the south, </p><p>in the Visayan town of Sogod. At </p><p>that time it was scarcely more than a large </p><p>church adjacent to a great convento or par- </p><p>ish house, both built of soft, white blocks </p><p>of coral rock and set in a wide, green plaza. </p><p>The dusky inhabitants, who were short in </p><p>stature but big in treachery and the art of </p><p>deceit, dwelt in a few narrow streets of </p><p>bamboo huts. </p><p> Behind this low, brown settlement, green</p><p>hills lifted the many-fingered jungle high </p><p>against the sky; and before it spread the </p><p>twinkling, steaming sea, white-hot in the </p><p>shadowless glare, lapping lifelessly the nar- </p><p>row beach just beyond a fringe of coconut </p><p>trees. All was very beautiful and very still, </p><p>save for the occasional calling of women, </p><p>the squeaking of a carabao cart, or, at night, </p><p>the wild ululations of fishermen with red, </p><p>flaring torches raised in their hands, who </p><p>squatted monkey-like upon the upcurved </p><p>prows of their swiftly flitting dug-outs. </p><p> Yet there was menace in the prospect,</p><p>and death brooded in the quiet. In the </p><p>Convento were a company of American sol- </p><p>diers, in the mountains a horde of outlaws. </p><p>The outward fairness and tranquillity were </p><p>but a screen that hid a gulf of barbarism as </p><p>wide and deep as the shimmering, sleepy </p><p>ocean. </p><p> As for the villagers, they sent food and</p><p>taxes to the guerillas, which entirely satis- </p><p>fied those Christian murderers, then told </p><p>the white men where the bandits were and </p><p>craftily led their hike astray. But they </p><p>took care always that a few old weapons </p><p>were found or that a personal enemy of the </p><p>guide was captured to color the deception. </p><p>And when the troops toiled back into the </p><p>dun, palm-shaded village, red-eyed, mad- </p><p>dened with heat, desperate with blacken- </p><p>ing thirst and the hopelessness of the chase, </p><p>a rabble of anxiously solicitous natives </p><p>flanked them and welcomed them with </p><p>voluble commiseration. </p><p> “How sad,” they exclaimed, “that the</p><p>brave soldados have labored so long in vain!” </p><p> Yet, they thought, is the loot of my broth-</p><p>er or my uncle or my cousin or my father, </p><p>who is supposed to be dead, or my wife’s </p><p>sweetheart still where I can find it? </p><p> “How unutterable that the unspeakables</p><p>in the mountains have again escaped!” </p><p> Yet, they argued, how fortunate it is for</p><p>us that these stupid pigs do not know that </p><p>the colonels or the generals are even now </p><p>at cards with the padre and perhaps will </p><p>dine today with the Americanos themselves. </p><p> Also the old men hobbled along, wagging</p><p>their apish heads in seeming pity. Women </p><p>stood in the door-holes of the thatches, si- </p><p>lent, indifferent, or glided slipperless across </p><p>the bamboo floors to peer, like cows, above </p><p>the sills of the window spaces. And every- </p><p>where, in the arms of the people or pressed </p><p>into gaps among them, were star-eyed, smil- </p><p>ing children, suns of hope in a sullen uni- </p><p>verse of malice, still pure as the fruit of the </p><p>trees. They laughed with the careless joy </p><p>of babyhood. Their elders leered inanely, </p><p>since they knew the value of a mask. </p><p> Men can not stand this sort of existence</p><p>indefinitely. At the end of a year the lack </p><p>of amusement, the frightful monotony, the </p><p>unrelenting climate and the extreme dis- </p><p>couragement that depressed the garrison </p><p>had driven many of them close to madness. </p><p> Some bore on grimly, waiting for that</p><p>vague day when they should be delivered. </p><p>Others sought refuge in vice, and a few died. </p><p> The captain, the lieutenant and the sur-</p><p>geon lived in a roomy shack across the plaza. </p><p>Life for them was even harder; for anxiety, </p><p>official responsibility and the burdens of </p><p>administration were added to their other </p><p>cares. Paddy was not the least of their </p><p>troubles. But they were as lenient with </p><p>him as the necessities of discipline allowed, </p><p>considering the circumstances under which </p><p>they lived. </p><p> There came a time, however, when Lieu-</p><p>tenant Bryant appeared for breakfast one </p><p>morning in a mood that said, as plainly as </p><p>words, that his patience was exhausted. </p><p> “Had to put Private Ruff in confinement</p><p>last night,” he explained. “Howling drunk </p><p>again in spite of his promises.” </p><p> “Ruff?” queried the captain.</p><p> “He’s that red-headed, big-eared, fly-</p><p>specked little devil with the innocent, baby- </p><p>blue eyes. The men call him ‘Paddy.’ ” </p><p>“Oh, yes! That’s four times in a year. </p><p>I’m afraid we shall have to put him before </p><p>a general court pretty soon, unless the med- </p><p>ico can cure him. How about it, Scotty? </p><p>What’s the psychology of it?” With a wink </p><p>at Bryant. </p><p> The doctor, a middle-aged contract</p><p>The One Sheep That Was Lost </p><p>69 </p><p>surgeon, was, in many respects, an odd mix- </p><p>ture of the Old World and the New. His </p><p>real name was Maclaren. </p><p> “Well,” he drawled as he slowly stirred</p><p>his coffee, “I’m no Keeley-cure man and it </p><p>seems to me I’ve had the beggar on my </p><p>hands before. From what I recollect, I </p><p>think I don’t want him again. But as for </p><p>the analysis of his case, I’m thinking it’s </p><p>very simple. He spends his leisure in the </p><p>native shacks, a-wandering from one to </p><p>t’other, according to fancy. And when he </p><p>finds congenial surroundings—and he has </p><p>good taste in judging the looks of a brown </p><p>lass—he thrones himself on a rice-mat and </p><p>gets bacchantic. </p><p> “Mind ye, I’m not condoning the offense,</p><p>but it might be he’s lonesome. And he has </p><p>a deal of thirst and curiosity, which he’s </p><p>experimented with for a year till both are </p><p>torrid in intensitee. Incidentally he has </p><p>learned to talk Visayan in all its classic </p><p>beauty, howbeit he did acquire a degraded </p><p>dialect of his own language in the stews of </p><p>his native land. Consequently-” </p><p> “Hold on, Scotty! Hold on!” laughed</p><p>the captain. “That’s enough. What you’re </p><p>driving at is that he’s nothing but a com- </p><p>mon drunk, but that he may be useful on </p><p>account of his knowledge of the local cus- </p><p>toms and this cog-and-ratchet language. </p><p>Hence, mercy. All right. We’ll let it go </p><p>at that. But there are some other things </p><p>he will have to learn, too.” </p><p> That was all until the next day. Then,</p><p>about noon, a sentry tapped on the sala </p><p>door. </p><p> “Prisoner Ruff, sir, wants to talk to the</p><p>captain.” </p><p> “What is it about?”</p><p> “Don’t know, sir; says it’s private.”</p><p> “H’m! Send him in.”</p><p> Very humbly, very respectfully, came</p><p>Paddy before his commander, who looked at </p><p>him a moment silently but not unkindly. </p><p>“What is it, Ruff?”</p><p> “I want permission, sir, to go on the hike</p><p>tonight.” </p><p> “What do you know about a hike to-</p><p>night?” </p><p> “I only heard some talk about it.”</p><p> “You’re a prisoner, Ruff.”</p><p> “Yes, sir.”</p><p> “What do you think I could do with you</p><p>on a hike? Do you think I could spare </p><p>any men to nurse you into staying sober? </p><p>You’re a shame to your company! It’s bad </p><p>enough to have you in garrison where other </p><p>men have to do your work for you while </p><p>you lie drunk in the guard-house. But on </p><p>a hike! I can’t do it, Ruff, you’d give out. </p><p>You’re no good.” </p><p> “That’s just it, sir,” replied the prisoner</p><p>after a pause. “I ain’t no good. I never </p><p>was no good. An’ it’s a cinch I ain’t doin’ </p><p>no good locked up in the mill.” </p><p> “That’s the point, Ruff, exactly.”</p><p> “I’ve told myself all you’ve just told me,</p><p>sir, an’ a whole lot more. That’s why I </p><p>wanted to see the captain, sir. I ain’t no </p><p>groveler nor lookin’ fer no bootlick. But </p><p>I’ve cut it out, sir. I want to get out o’ </p><p>the mill. I want to go on this hike, sir, </p><p>an’ I want to make good. S’help me, cap- </p><p>tain, I’m goin’ to soldier an’ I’m goin’ to </p><p>do it right!” </p><p> The doctor, most gracious of men, cleared</p><p>his throat suggestively, almost pleadingly; </p><p>and a twinkle lighted the captain’s eyes. </p><p> “Well, Ruff,” he said, “I’ve heard that</p><p>sort of talk a good many times before, and </p><p>it usually only means a bad case of remorse </p><p>that passes off altogether too soon. How- </p><p>ever, I’ll give you one chance more, but </p><p>only one. That’s all; you’ll be released </p><p>later. </p><p> “Well, Scotty, what’s the psychology of</p><p>it now? How long will he last?” </p><p> “ ’Bout two weeks, mebbe. It’s hard to</p><p>make a deceesion. But the lee tie rascal </p><p>makes a strong appeal to the paternal in-</p><p>stinct.” </p><p>THE bay was red and purple with </p><p>the glow of the setting sun, and the </p><p>tiny islands far off on the horizon </p><p>rose above the sea line, green and blue and </p><p>pink, curling their edges up toward the </p><p>painted clouds, when “D” Company once </p><p>more marched quietly into the jungle. Pad- </p><p>dy was with them, vowing to make good; </p><p>but the moon sneered at him through the </p><p>rattling canes, the huge palms whetted </p><p>their fronds derisively against one another, </p><p>and the breezes laughed in the leaves. </p><p>Everything mocked him. </p><p> But he plodded cheerfully and optimistic-</p><p>ally on in his proper place, and all went </p><p>well for three days. Then, in the evening, </p><p>he was tortured with a frightful thirst. It </p><p>was not vino he wanted, though, it was </p><p>water. </p><p> They were bivouacked upon the summit</p><p>of a ridge; their haversacks for pillows, </p><p>70 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>banana-leaves for beds,^ the moonlight for </p><p>cover, and rustling fans to whisper dreams. </p><p>The brain-fevering day had yielded to the </p><p>cool night; and as the voices in the shadows </p><p>timidly ventured forth they slept. </p><p> Only Paddy and the guard were still</p><p>awake; the one because none knew in what </p><p>form death might be crawling upon them </p><p>from the valley, the other because his mouth </p><p>burned and his tongue was stiff from the </p><p>torment he suffered. </p><p> He scooped a hole to accommodate his</p><p>hip and so made his earthy bed more com- </p><p>fortable. Then he stuffed his hat beneath </p><p>the small of his back and thus eased and </p><p>shifted his aching body. But no device he </p><p>could invent brought either rest or forget- </p><p>fulness. </p><p> Later he prowled about among his fel-</p><p>lows and examined their canteens. They </p><p>were empty. By the embers of the cook’s </p><p>fire was a huge can of boiled water, but it </p><p>was still scalding hot. It would not be cool </p><p>for many hours. Yet he filled his tin cup </p><p>from it and lay down again to wait, until it </p><p>should be cold enough to drink. Then, </p><p>somewhere in the darkness below, a dog </p><p>howled, though the tom-toms that had </p><p>warned the country of their approach were </p><p>long since hushed. </p><p> “Wot’s that?” he wondered. “Some one</p><p>cornin’?” </p><p> The sentry paused in his monotonous</p><p>round, listening; and Paddy remained mo- </p><p>tionless, gazing steadily into the black void </p><p>beneath. Suddenly even that seemed to </p><p>fade as he looked into it. He lost all sense </p><p>of everything. Thirst, the dog, danger and </p><p>the hardness of the ground became of no </p><p>moment. He was asleep and dreamed that </p><p>he was immersed in a great lake, clear and </p><p>comforting. He drank until he could hold </p><p>no more, but yet he was unsatisfied. Pres- </p><p>ently a monstrous beast came down to the </p><p>shore and wallowed, then changed to a </p><p>spreading sheet of flame so that the whole </p><p>surface boiled. He strangled, for he had </p><p>drank the fire and it seethed in his throat. </p><p> He sat up choking and reached for his</p><p>cup. Either he or the man on post had </p><p>knocked it over while he slept. </p><p> “I’ve simply got to have ut,” he groaned,</p><p>“or something.” </p><p> The barking had stopped, but a point of</p><p>light flickered far down the hillside. He </p><p>had not noticed it before. Then it disap- </p><p>peared. </p><p> “I’m goin’ after ’t. S’help me, I got to</p><p>do ut! I can’t stand ut no more!” </p><p> He slid noiselessly into the underbrush.</p><p>Alert, and with the utmost caution, he </p><p>groped his way toward where the gleam had </p><p>been. Soon he came into a clearing and </p><p>there he discovered a well - made hut. </p><p>Through the raised flap that marked the </p><p>front he saw a young woman within, seat- </p><p>ed upon her heels, sorting metal buttons by </p><p>the aid of a feeble flame that danced in a </p><p>glass of coconut-oil. </p><p> Without the least sign of surprise or any</p><p>other emotion, she paused in her work and </p><p>stared at him appraisingly. </p><p> “On watch,” concluded Paddy, “an’ sort-</p><p>in’ out buttons fer makin’ the ends o’ tin- </p><p>can cartridges.” </p><p> “ ’Sus Marie!” she exclaimed at last.</p><p> “Tubig!” he whispered.</p><p> The woman arose softly and brought him</p><p>a drink in a dripping coconut-shell from a </p><p>jar that stood near the window-gap. He </p><p>called for more. </p><p> “Vino? Anisette?’' she suggested cun-</p><p>ningly. </p><p> Paddy was not insensible of a warning</p><p>that welled up within him, but he was op- </p><p>timistic. Besides, one glass wouldn’t hurt </p><p>him, he argued, and he needed it, or thought </p><p>he did, which is the same thing to those </p><p>who wish it to be. So he sinned again, for </p><p>the last time. </p><p> It was late the next afternoon when he</p><p>awoke. The woman was smoking a cigar </p><p>contentedly, apparently unaware even of </p><p>his presence. She was huddled upon the </p><p>floor fussing with a little fire in a box of</p><p>earth, beside which was a pot of rice ready </p><p>for the cooking. </p><p> But there were now other visitors; for</p><p>two barefooted, slippered men crouched in </p><p>a corner, whose enormous, straw hats were </p><p>inscribed “Zona 16,” in big, red characters. </p><p>On the shoulders of their loose, white coats </p><p>were red straps burdened with tin insignia; </p><p>and along the seams of their baggy trousers, </p><p>red, flannel stripes. Their buttons were </p><p>small and brassy, each crudely embossed </p><p>with a single star. </p><p> “Two gu - gu generals,” noted Paddy,</p><p>stricken immovable. </p><p> Little by little the memory of the night</p><p>before came out of the dark fog in the back </p><p>of his mind. The details of the present be- </p><p>came vivid and real, and he wondered what </p><p>time it was. Then he realized that if his </p><p>The One Sheep That Was Lost </p><p>71 </p><p>company were near, these two rascals in the </p><p>corner would not be sitting there. Evident- </p><p>ly the captain had given up searching for </p><p>him or had gone in the wrong direction, </p><p>which was more probable. A shudder trick- </p><p>led down his spine like a drop of cold water. </p><p> “I sure am up against it this time for</p><p>fair!” he sighed to himself. </p><p> The woman set the pot of rice upon the</p><p>fire, and brought cigarettes for the gener- </p><p>als. It was plain that they had not been </p><p>there long, for as they smoked she de- </p><p>scribed the manner of Paddy’s coming. </p><p> Said one, a surly, ill-natured brute not</p><p>good to look upon— </p><p> “He is, no doubt, a Mason and a heretic.”</p><p>The other raised his palms, shook his </p><p>head and was grave. </p><p> “What shall we do with him?” asked this</p><p>one with a deprecatory little smile. </p><p> The first shrugged indifferently.</p><p> “We can not be bothered with prisoners,”</p><p>he declared tonelessly. </p><p> The second bowed submissively.</p><p> “True,” he agreed. “But who knows?</p><p>We may use him.” </p><p>“Then, at least, since he has awakened, </p><p>I will secure him. Woman, fetch me a cord!” </p><p>But Paddy had no wish to be bound. </p><p>“There’s only wan way out,” thought he. </p><p>“I’ll have t’ join ’em.” </p><p> He arose leisurely, feigning unconcern.</p><p>Then, leaning back against the wall, his </p><p>hands in his pockets and his sodden blue </p><p>eyes looking from one to the other, he spoke </p><p>to them in their own tongue, “in all its </p><p>classic beauty,” augmented as it is with </p><p>borrowed Spanish. </p><p> “Listen!” he bade them. “The woman</p><p>has told you I came alone, of my own will. </p><p>Therefore I claim your confidence. Do I </p><p>not know the Americanos are even now </p><p>searching for me? They will not find me.</p><p>They keep to the trails, for they are stu- </p><p>pid. I was here within call when they lay </p><p>on the crest above us, yet they did not </p><p>overtake me. Do I not know you have </p><p>eyes in every bamboo, that I could not go </p><p>along a dozen barras or cry for help, and </p><p>live? I could not leave if I would. You </p><p>will not bind me. And there is more. I </p><p>have something to say to Pachico.” </p><p> Exactly what he had to communicate was</p><p>not at all clear, however, even to himself. </p><p> The ill-tempered one seemed about to</p><p>speak, but the mild one checked him with </p><p>a sign. </p><p> “What is this you have to say to Pa-</p><p>chico?” he asked. </p><p> “There will be great honor for you both</p><p>if he knows. Surely it would be unfortun- </p><p>ate if one with a secret should be hindered </p><p>or fail to arrive. Pachico would hear of it. </p><p>He would be offended. I can not tell, now. ” </p><p>Over the face of the surly one spread a </p><p>look that none who knows the native can </p><p>mistake. As the woman glided soundlessly </p><p>out, he sprang to his feet, cat-like, his naked </p><p>bolo quivering in his grasp. </p><p> “Shall I let this spotted-faced white man,</p><p>with hair like hemp and eyes like water, </p><p>defy me?” </p><p> The merciful one said gently—</p><p> “Wait, my friend, till tomorrow.”</p><p> “Now!”</p><p> “Certainly,” he said. “But why are you</p><p>unwilling that he should speak only with </p><p>Pachico? Is it because you would know his </p><p>business for yourself?” </p><p> The rabid one settled upon his heels like</p><p>one who is felled, his face inscrutable. But </p><p>he of the deprecatory little smile seemed </p><p>not to notice. </p><p> Paddy sat down, cross-legged, upon the</p><p>floor. </p><p> “Phew!” he breathed softly to himself.</p><p>“Pretty close! I wasn’t lookin’ fer that, </p><p>neither. I see how ut is. Not extry good </p><p>friends. Got him that time; Softy did, too.” </p><p>His brow was damp but he dared not</p><p>wipe it. This was no time to show weak- </p><p>ness. But he said no more; for to take ad- </p><p>vantage of a point secured, even to signify </p><p>perception of the fact, might pique the pride </p><p>of even the mild one. Then he would sure- </p><p>ly die. But his wits were busy, exceeding- </p><p>ly busy, and he wrenched them free from </p><p>the grip of the liquor to evolve some plan </p><p>for escape. </p><p> Night was descending, and soon the wo-</p><p>man returned, puffing her vile weed. She </p><p>cast but a glance at Paddy, and though it </p><p>may have surprised her to see him living, </p><p>she did not show it. She brought the sup- </p><p>per from the fire, and the placid one invited </p><p>him to eat. </p><p> “Tomorrow,” he said, “you shall report</p><p>to Pachico.” </p><p> “It is better tonight,” replied Paddy, not</p><p>too insistently, “since it might occur that I </p><p>should be bitten by a snake or die of air in </p><p>the heart while I sleep. Can you not, ami- </p><p>go,” he addressed the sullen one, “despatch </p><p>me to Pachico?” </p><p>72 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> But the brute refused to be conciliated.</p><p> “I can not.”</p><p> “Good! Men of our superiority should</p><p>not be disturbed. Pardon! You are right. </p><p>But there are always the mere soldados. </p><p>Surely we can send a message?” </p><p> He of the little smile was obviously in-</p><p>terested and studied the American intently, </p><p>even admiringly. Paddy had guessed a situ- </p><p>ation between these two, a possibility,, and </p><p>was striving for the facts. </p><p> “I have no soldiers!” blurted the blood-</p><p>thirsty one, a general caught unawares be- </p><p>cause he despised his enemy. Then he saw </p><p>the trap and grew turgid with rage. </p><p> The gentle one laughed a very little, al-</p><p>most with contempt, and shrugged his </p><p>shoulders. But he eyed his companion like </p><p>a lynx, not once relaxing his watchfulness, </p><p>while he spoke to Paddy. </p><p> “You have great intelligence, amigo,” he</p><p>said. “I will tell you something. Our </p><p>friend, here, is a famous general. But he </p><p>does nothing for Pachico and much for him- </p><p>self. For that the chief will give him no </p><p>men.” </p><p>“Diablo!” exclaimed the other, appalled. </p><p>“What importance if I tell this man,” de- </p><p>manded the calm one softly, but tense, on </p><p>guard, as he pretended to misunderstand, </p><p>“since you kill him tomorrow?” </p><p> He spoke again to Paddy.</p><p> “Indeed, a few of my friends desire that</p><p>he should soon succeed Pachico.” </p><p> Over the pot of rice the hand of the other</p><p>hovered, trembling. The woman was light- </p><p>ing the wick in the glass of oil; and as it </p><p>weakly came to life, Paddy shivered. He </p><p>was chilled, like one who waits a promised </p><p>specter or dreads momentarily its cold touch </p><p>in the darkness. But he understood, now, </p><p>or at least appreciated the certainty of </p><p>what impended. </p><p> As if an intuition forced his speech, like</p><p>pledging allegiance he asked—</p><p> “But you have many other friends?”</p><p>“Very many, amigo,” the cool one an- </p><p>swered, “you are quick to understand.” </p><p> The sullen one ate of the food in his palm,</p><p>then stood. He did not even reach for his </p><p>weapon, for the tranquil one was clearly </p><p>ready. He looked at the woman, whose </p><p>back was toward him as she tinkered at the </p><p>fire; at Paddy, oppressed like a watcher who </p><p>does not look up in the dark hour of an- </p><p>other; and then at his wily, tigerish foe, </p><p>who, Judas-like, had dipped with him into </p><p>the pot of rice and now attentively enjoyed </p><p>the agony of his prey. At last he went </p><p>mutely to the door; stared long into the </p><p>blackness, and left them. </p><p> He at the rice arose and stepped to the</p><p>window. Upon the sill he set the feeble, </p><p>flickering flame the woman had provided, </p><p>and remained there a moment. Then he </p><p>returned with it, a smile on his face and </p><p>something in his eyes that turned the heart </p><p>to stone. </p><p> “For this I brought him here,” was all</p><p>he said. </p><p> Paddy turned away that the creature</p><p>might not read his face. </p><p> “Holal Americano! There was mastery</p><p>now in the voice, not craft, and Paddy rec- </p><p>ognized it. </p><p> “Tell me your business. I, myself, am</p><p>Pachico! Will you have proof?” </p><p> “It is enough.” Then, desperately but</p><p>with head erect, he uttered whatever his </p><p>misery prompted. </p><p> “I came here, as I and the woman have</p><p>said, of my own desire. I have foresworn </p><p>the Americanos. Four times have they put </p><p>me in their prison. Seven months have I </p><p>spent there.” </p><p> The listener’s accursed features reflected</p><p>no thought, no emotion. But his cunning </p><p>understanding would clutch the slightest </p><p>flaw, and miss not a single word, though it </p><p>spelt life or death for Paddy Ruff. </p><p> “I must speak truth,” hummed in the</p><p>pleader’s thoughts, so he lied with the facts. </p><p> “I have no love for their cells nor they</p><p>for me. When I go back it must be with </p><p>your people or I shall not return. I have a </p><p>scheme for effecting this, and I will destroy </p><p>my enemies.” </p><p> The other looked evilly upon him, suspi-</p><p>ciously, treacherously, as was to be expected. </p><p> “Listen! I know what has passed here.</p><p>He who has gone out will not come back. </p><p>The lamp in the window showed no more </p><p>than a candle among the trees, but it shone </p><p>on a long journey. You have many friends. </p><p>They saw, and read it for a signal, since it </p><p>was for that you brought him here. So will' </p><p>it be with me, too, if I displease you. Is it </p><p>not so? Therefore I shall obey your com- </p><p>mands.” </p><p> “You have spoken of a way to go back</p><p>as one of us, to the camp of the Americanos. </p><p>What is it?” </p><p> “Wot’ll I say? Wot’ll I say?” implored</p><p>Paddy of himself. </p><p>The One Sheep That Was Lost </p><p>73 </p><p> He lurched to his feet and walked slowly</p><p>to the water-jar. As he drank he imagined </p><p>he could feel the other’s gaze upon him. </p><p>Up from his mud-stiffened canvas leggings, </p><p>over khaki breeches and dark, blue-flannel </p><p>shirt it burned, till it scorched his pallid </p><p>face. Then an idea came; not quite formed, </p><p>indeed, yet outlined clearly enough for the </p><p>present. </p><p> He turned back quickly to Pachico and</p><p>smiled at him confidingly. Whenever he </p><p>smiled, his red head seemed like a sun of </p><p>goodwill and his eyes like wells of trust. </p><p> “I will show you how to take the rifles of</p><p>the Americanos and all their stores; the big </p><p>chests of salmon, of meats, of cartridges, of </p><p>shoes, of clothing and of money that are </p><p>piled high in their cuartel; and you can not </p><p>fail.” </p><p> The cupidity, the lust of power and of</p><p>blood that burned in the monster’s breast </p><p>flamed into his cheeks. He let himself an- </p><p>ticipate, for a moment, what all this meant </p><p>to him. As for the white stranger, who had </p><p>too much intelligence, he should certainly </p><p>make no trouble when he ceased to be use- </p><p>ful. No chances must be taken with such </p><p>as he. The little smile played significantly </p><p>upon his lips. </p><p> “And you, my friend,” he insinuated al-</p><p>most effectionately, “how shall I then hon- </p><p>or you?” </p><p> But Paddy had not sat upon the mats of</p><p>Sogod so many times in vain. </p><p> “It is true, of course,” he said, “that I</p><p>have a motive and something to gain. But </p><p>I want neither riches nor authority. I ask </p><p>not even that you give me back my rifle, or </p><p>that you promise me pay. I shall be con- </p><p>tent if I am never more imprisoned. I am </p><p>doing this for what they have done to me. </p><p>It is for hate, nothing more. Let us dismiss </p><p>the woman so that I may show you how it </p><p>can be done.” </p><p> She was reclining upon the floor, dozing</p><p>contentedly. </p><p> “Go you to Dolores!” commanded Pa-</p><p>chico. “Tell my generals that I return to- </p><p>morrow. Say nothing of this man. The </p><p>General Miguel, so you shall say, is watch- </p><p>ing the expedition of the Americanos. You </p><p>comprehend?” </p><p> “Senorl” she mumbled, and slipped away</p><p>into the gloom. </p><p> “It is thus,” continued Paddy. “We will</p><p>send a letter to their thick-headed captain </p><p>and proffer our surrender and that of all our </p><p>army. We will write that upon a stated </p><p>day, let us say the fourth from the letter, </p><p>we shall be upon the plaza of Malavista. </p><p>There we will lay down our arms. He will </p><p>come with his whole army, surely all but a </p><p>few, for he knows we are many, so that </p><p>there may be a splendid ceremony. But </p><p>we shall not be there. </p><p> “He will march with a loud noise of can-</p><p>teen and bayonet by the easy trail, for that </p><p>is the way they do. We will go by the long </p><p>route to Sogod, and we must be there when </p><p>the enemy leave. When we can no longer </p><p>hear the dogs bark at their coming, then we </p><p>will run to the storehouse. The guard must </p><p>flee or die. There I will indicate what is </p><p>filled and what is empty, where are the </p><p>cases of arms and where the money, so that </p><p>we can quickly retreat to the mountains. </p><p> “On the way we will destroy them from</p><p>the summits above the road, in a place from </p><p>which there is no escape, with their own ri- </p><p>fles. I shall secure my vengeance, and you </p><p>may give me what else you will. I shall be </p><p>content and you shall be master.” </p><p> “But our troops have tried such strategy</p><p>before,” objected Pachico, “and the Ameri- </p><p>canos have always eluded us or done some </p><p>queer thing that none but pigs would think </p><p>of.” </p><p> “It is for this reason,” explained Paddy.</p><p>“You do not know their ways nor their </p><p>manner of fighting. For example, has it </p><p>not happened, when you have rushed upon </p><p>them with the bolo so quickly they could </p><p>not use their guns, that they have thrown </p><p>these down and beaten your men with their </p><p>fists? If you had known, you could have </p><p>prevented this and killed them all when </p><p>often you destroyed but a few. Yet your </p><p>soldiers are brave as any in all the world.</p><p> “Let us take a short time and first teach</p><p>the army how those people fight and what </p><p>their tactics are. Also, when we strike, I </p><p>can tell you from the signs about the bar- </p><p>racks what is their design when they de- </p><p>part. Thus there will be no error, since we </p><p>shall know as much as they, and we can </p><p>not lose.” </p><p> “I will think of this,” Pachico said.</p><p>“To-morrow I will hold a council. Let us </p><p>sleep.” </p><p> “A cigarette, I beg of you.”</p><p> “You have it,” the general answered, pro-</p><p>ducing a package hastily and graciously, as </p><p>might an Oriental prince for an honored </p><p>guest. </p><p>74 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>UPON the following morning they </p><p>set out to join the army. This con- </p><p>sisted of seven generals subordinate </p><p>to Pachico, many colonels, and a progress- </p><p>ively increasing number of lieutenant-colo- </p><p>nels, majors, captains and lieutenants. In </p><p>all there were about two hundred; but the </p><p>predominance of officers was of slight con- </p><p>sideration, since there was little semblance </p><p>of organization. Rank merely determined </p><p>the share of pillage each received. </p><p> The day was well advanced when Paddy</p><p>was led before the owners of this opera </p><p>boujje, and they glared at him exultingly, a </p><p>real American captive, as they lolled be- </p><p>neath the coco-palms and idled the steam- </p><p>ing hours away with monte and cigarettes. </p><p> It was not proper that officers such as</p><p>they should sit with those of lower grade, </p><p>for those were only fighters, and generals </p><p>have greater things to do. So, farther back </p><p>in the shady grove, the majors, the captains </p><p>and the subalterns loafed and gambled like </p><p>their betters, except that the stakes were </p><p>smaller; while here and there was only a </p><p>soldado, a link in the chain that signaled </p><p>news across the island by tom-tom, fire and </p><p>sturdy runner, or watched the trails from a </p><p>perch in the miry rice-fields or the top of a </p><p>swinging tree. </p><p> The generals scowled at Paddy; and then,</p><p>since their lord was silent, they turned again </p><p>to bet on the ace of baslos. But when they </p><p>had tired of the game or the bankers had </p><p>won their all, Pachico called them to him </p><p>when the siesta hour had come and gone, </p><p>and told them, in flowery words, the his- </p><p>tory and the offer of the intelligent Ameri- </p><p>can. </p><p> “What is the name of this foreigner?”</p><p>croaked an ancient whose lineaments were </p><p>seamed like a monkey’s. </p><p> “It is one not hard to pronounce,” replied</p><p>the chief. “It is Paddy R-ruff.” </p><p> “Are you that Paddy,” another asked,</p><p>“who visits so much with our people of So- </p><p>god?” </p><p> “I am,” admitted he, seating himself on</p><p>the grass among them. </p><p> “It is as I thought. He is that one of</p><p>whom the priest has spoken. I, myself, </p><p>have often seen him in the Iiendas, drink- </p><p>ing.” </p><p> “And I also,” said the old man. “We</p><p>know of him favorably. We have even </p><p>talked with him in Sogod.” </p><p> But another spoke more cautiously.</p><p> “It is well planned,” conceded he, “but</p><p>how are we to know that the infidels will </p><p>leave the doors unlocked?” </p><p> “It is thus,” submitted Paddy. “They</p><p>think the guard sufficient. They have never </p><p>turned the locks, for the doors are heavy </p><p>and hard to close. Yet, if they do, I know </p><p>where the keys are hung.” </p><p> “But they may not go out,” another ob-</p><p>jected. </p><p> “That we can see from the heights. But</p><p>they will, for the captain will desire the </p><p>great glory of this surrender.” </p><p> “And our friend the Americano, what</p><p>does he desire?” one other asked. “Shall </p><p>he have a command?” </p><p> “As the council wish,” replied Paddy,</p><p>raising his palms and shrugging. “But I </p><p>am content to be simply a drill-master; or, </p><p>better still, our leader’s minister of war. </p><p>Otherwise, some captain might be jealous </p><p>that one so newly come should be so soon </p><p>promoted, and an accident to me might </p><p>then deprive you of your victory.” </p><p> He had no mind to follow a certain Miguel</p><p>recently suspected of ambition, yet he de- </p><p>sired to hold some sort of dignified position </p><p>that he might not be slain in mere contempt. </p><p> To have a minister of war was pleasing</p><p>to them, for they had heard of such an offi- </p><p>cer who, in Spain, was a grand man. But </p><p>to none had it ever been related that he </p><p>held a post in battle, nor was there any </p><p>precedent by which to establish his share </p><p>of spoils. </p><p> Therefore, until now, no one had wished</p><p>a place among them so void of either glory</p><p>or remuneration, even though it doubtless- </p><p>ly commanded high respect. Consequently, </p><p>if the white man, who craved no fame and </p><p>coveted no profit, since the Americanos are </p><p>all rich, would be satisfied with a portfolio, </p><p>it was excellent, they agreed, that the com- </p><p>mander should have him upon his staff. </p><p>And Pachico, who had said no word </p><p>throughout the council, approved, since it </p><p>was in his thoughts to do this very thing. </p><p> “Then let us begin at once. And if, to-</p><p>morrow, you will give me pens, ink and </p><p>paper, I will write a manual of drill for all </p><p>the captains, whom I, myself, will instruct </p><p>in it.” </p><p> A trifle dubiously they acquiesced, and</p><p>from that time on, the order of their days </p><p>was drill. </p><p> They raided helpless villages no more, nor</p><p>burned nor looted. Only they still exacted </p><p>The One Sheep That Was Lost </p><p>75 </p><p>tribute of money, provisions and cloth, since </p><p>these were necessary. They made their </p><p>quarters, for greater comfort, in a barrio of </p><p>Dolores, where Paddy was given a shack to </p><p>himself, as became a minister of war, in </p><p>which were a bamboo bed, a chair, and a </p><p>small, rectangular table. </p><p> They posted guards on the paths and the</p><p>hilltops, and lookouts watched by day </p><p>and by night to see that nothing disturbed </p><p>the generals, and, especially, the minister </p><p>of war. He was assigned, also, a captain </p><p>for aide, to fetch and to carry; for it was </p><p>better, they said, that he, a white man, </p><p>should not be exposed too much to the sun </p><p>by day or the jungle mists at night. </p><p> He thanked them very heartily, pretend-</p><p>ing not to understand; and hour after hour </p><p>spread out a kind of “school of the com- </p><p>pany” on many sheets of paper. </p><p> But he trained them and wrote for them</p><p>during all those wearying sittings not to </p><p>make soldiers of the ruffians, but to gain </p><p>time and to win their confidence. The suc- </p><p>cess of the plan that had suggested itself so </p><p>hazily at first, required not only the faith of </p><p>his captors but also the cooperation of his </p><p>countrymen. For that reason he had pro- </p><p>posed the letter of surrender, which, he in- </p><p>tended, should be solely a device to carry a </p><p>message of his own. </p><p> The great difficulty was to write one</p><p>communication within another in such a </p><p>way as to be detected by his captain but </p><p>not by the insurrectos. </p><p> As he labored at his little table over the</p><p>lessons for his masters, this problem formed </p><p>his principle study. He considered and re- </p><p>jected various schemes. Eventually he re- </p><p>membered that “Big Bill” Schindel and </p><p>“Teaser” Ritter had plotted most reprehen- </p><p>sible things under the very noses of the po- </p><p>lice, with the help of an invisible ink com- </p><p>pounded of onion-juice mixed with milk and </p><p>water. The knowledge had nearly cost him </p><p>dear, for he had carried some of the mis- </p><p>sives before the double nature of the cor- </p><p>respondence had been discovered. He de- </p><p>cided that it would be easy to apprise the </p><p>captain of the two-fold structure of the let-</p><p>ter, and concerned himself with securing </p><p>the ingredients. </p><p> To this end he shivered one day as he</p><p>stood on the parade with Pachico, watch- </p><p>ing the drill. The fellow expressed an- </p><p>xiety. </p><p> “It is nothing,” Paddy explained, casting</p><p> a woful look at the skies as he hunched his</p><p> shoulders and chattered his teeth. “The</p><p> night-dews give me rigors at times, which</p><p> stay in my bones till the sun brings them</p><p> out. If only I had onions and the milk that</p><p> is sold in cans, I should never be troubled;</p><p> or so, at least, it was when I lay in the jail</p><p> of Sogod.”</p><p> “ ’Sus!” exclaimed Pachico. “If that is</p><p> all, you shall have them. I will ask the</p><p> padre in Sogod for onions, which he can pro-</p><p> cure from the heretics there; for they are</p><p> on excellent terms, as you know. And, as</p><p> for the milk in cans, the Spaniard here in</p><p> Dolores shall furnish all you require.”</p><p> Indeed, these remarkable essentials to a</p><p> cure were not long in arriving; and though</p><p> there is no explanation of the fact, either</p><p> empiric or rational, yet it is undeniable that</p><p> when they had been received Paddy quaked</p><p> no more. He also took pains to write, each</p><p> day, only as much as could be learned upon</p><p> the next; for he knew they would soon lose</p><p> patience, and he felt that a manuscript re-</p><p> pudiated would confess the looseness of his</p><p> hold upon them.</p><p> As a matter of fact, in about three weeks</p><p> the steps began to lag, the hands to slouch</p><p> and their enthusiasm to cool perceptibly.</p><p> Paddy went at once to Pachico, whose zeal</p><p> was waning like his men’s.</p><p> “I come to you,” he said, “as your minis-</p><p> ter of war, to announce that the army is</p><p> prepared.”</p><p> “It is well,” approved the general, more</p><p> cordial than he had been for some time be-</p><p> fore. “Also I am sensible of much improve-</p><p> ment in their art. Tonight I will consult</p><p> the council.”</p><p> Paddy returned to his shack and stretch-</p><p> ed himself upon the bamboo bed. His aide</p><p> sprawled upon a rice-mat under the win-</p><p> dow-hole, asleep.</p><p> But the unhappy prisoner took no heed</p><p> of him. The moment had come when he</p><p> must make the last move between himself</p><p> and his own kind. It was only a little way,</p><p> but if he fell there would be none to raise</p><p> him.</p><p> He was afraid. So cunningly had he plot-</p><p> ted, so skilfully had he dissembled, so severe</p><p> had been the strain, that the very prospect</p><p> of fulfilment conjured up doubts and called</p><p> forth terrors from his imagination. Reac-</p><p> tion like this was inevitable. In an uncer-</p><p>•	tain way he knew it and that the mood</p><p> would pass. Yet he had baited a trap with</p><p>76 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>a massacre, to lure devils, and wagered his </p><p>life on an untried gin. </p><p> “But they’ll kill me anyhow,” he rea-</p><p>soned in his own poor dialect, “an’ I got t’ </p><p>do ut. It’s a chanst.” </p><p> “Four-flushin’ I am,” he continued in si-</p><p>lent deliberation, “an’ if any one calls me, </p><p>I’m gone. Cut off me hands an’ me feet, </p><p>mebbe, an’ bury me t’ the neck in a hill of </p><p>ants.” </p><p>THE siesta hour was over. His as- </p><p>sistant stirred, then awoke, and seat- </p><p>ed himself in the doorway, smoking, </p><p>looking out at nothing. But Paddy re- </p><p>mained where he was, his hands behind his </p><p>ruddy, unkempt head, his ankles crossed in </p><p>an attitude of ease, his blue eyes dim with </p><p>worry, trying to predict and to provide </p><p>against such difficulties as he had not yet </p><p>foreseen. In the meantime, one by one, the </p><p>minutes fluttered by and night slowly ad- </p><p>vanced upon them. </p><p> The rice-pots were steaming and the army</p><p>clustered round them, while the yellows, </p><p>the greens and the pinks of sunset dulled </p><p>to a copper glow. He heard the evening </p><p>babble; sometimes a deep-chested grunt, or </p><p>a shrill, falsetto argument that invariably </p><p>ended in a high-pitched, even-toned, long- </p><p>breathed “ah-h-h” that meant contempt, </p><p>derision or a challenge, as one chose. There </p><p>were laughter and muttering. </p><p> The native went out for the eight-o’clock</p><p>meal. Paddy forsook his couch, with sweat- </p><p>ing palms and chill brow, to explore the </p><p>gaps in the nipa walls for spying eyes. </p><p>Then, with trembling fingers, he lighted his </p><p>primitive lamp, tiptoed softly with it to the </p><p>table, and cast the die. </p><p> First, he opened a can of milk and drank</p><p>nearly all of it. Then he crushed an onion </p><p>into the residue. He added a dash of water </p><p>and strained the mixture, as best he could, </p><p>into a sea-shell which he used for a paper- </p><p>weight. </p><p> With this unusual fluid he indited a note</p><p>to his captain. It was not very long, and </p><p>covered less than one side of a sheet of pa-</p><p>per. He made several copies, and when </p><p>they were dry, laid them all, blank sides up, </p><p>on top of the pile from which he had taken </p><p>them. The words could not be seen, at </p><p>least in the faint, wavering light of his </p><p>room. </p><p> Afterward he washed the shell, but left</p><p>the empty tin and the refuse to testify that </p><p>he had eaten, in case the observant warden </p><p>should manifest solicitous curiosity. </p><p> And now, with good India ink of the</p><p>land, he wrote an offer of capitulation on </p><p>the clean surface of the uppermost page, in </p><p>very fair Visayan, free from hidden mean- </p><p>ing or doubt-inspiring mark. </p><p> He worked swiftly, and when his inmate</p><p>returned, appeared to be dozing again. The </p><p>master had finished his sena, the latter re- </p><p>ported, and had summoned the seven to his </p><p>house. The ministro was expected, also. </p><p>Paddy arose and obeyed, with a primal </p><p>prayer to an unknown God welling up in his </p><p>heart. </p><p> He saluted the seven gravely, and sta-</p><p>tioned himself beside Pachico’s chair. </p><p> “I return to you, my General,” he said</p><p>with a profound bow, “what is left of my </p><p>writing materials; for since the drill is fin- </p><p>ished, I need them no more.” </p><p> So naturally as to make it seem quite ac-</p><p>cidental, he laid his papers upon a pile in </p><p>front of Pachico. He retained only the com- </p><p>pleted despatch. </p><p> “Gracias!” murmured the chief. “While</p><p>you were coming we discussed the campaign </p><p>once more. Have you, perhaps, something </p><p>further to recommend?” </p><p> “Nothing. We are ready. I have also</p><p>prepared the letter, to save your excellency </p><p>trouble, as a ministro should. If it is not </p><p>good there are the means before you to say </p><p>what you will.” </p><p> “Read it.”</p><p> Paddy, who had remained standing, shift-</p><p>ed his weight to one foot and raised the </p><p>document in both hands while he read: </p><p>To the Commandante Militar residing in Sogod. </p><p>Very Respected Senor: </p><p> Believing that the welfare of our beloved country</p><p>so demands, and that peace under the powerful Uni- </p><p>ted States is better than a hopeless warfare for our </p><p>independence, we hereby propose freely, though </p><p>with painful sorrow, to surrender upon the plaza of </p><p>Malavista on the afternoon of the fourth day that </p><p>follows the present. </p><p> Most obediently we kiss your hands.</p><p> He passed it to Pachico, who scrutinized</p><p>it closely, his eyes illumined as if to burn a </p><p>secret from the very pulp. So, too, each of </p><p>the seven scanned it and a few glanced </p><p>casually at the other side. </p><p> “Is it sufficient?” inquired Paddy. “Or</p><p>shall another be written?” </p><p> “It will serve. It is as well done as that</p><p>of Capile, who relinquished his command on </p><p>The One Sheep That Was Lost </p><p>77 </p><p>Panay last year. Doubtless you saw it in </p><p>the prints.” </p><p> “I have read it.”</p><p> “Let us sign this.”</p><p> “But wait!” objected one. “We know,</p><p>surely, that the Americanos do not kill if </p><p>that can be avoided. Yet, if we all sign </p><p>and the enterprise fails, it may not after- </p><p>ward be convenient for us to visit Sogod, </p><p>and our families may be incommoded.” </p><p> “It is true,” agreed Paddy.</p><p> Now, it was not open to argument that</p><p>any instructions he wished to give his cap- </p><p>tain would have to be in English; and that </p><p>could be accomplished only in his signature. </p><p>He had reviewed all possible obstacles to </p><p>this during his meditations. He had con- </p><p>trived a method to meet every emergency </p><p>pertaining to it. Not until he was sure he </p><p>could warn his own officers had he conceded </p><p>his readiness for the undertaking. He had </p><p>hoped for this particular protest, and was </p><p>prepared to make it himself. But it pleased </p><p>him more to have another interpose. He </p><p>stooped to adjust a lacing upon his tattered </p><p>shoes to hide his satisfaction. </p><p> “Let Pachico,” he resumed, “whose name</p><p>they already know, alone ratify it for him- </p><p>self and his forces; and that the act may be </p><p>official, let it be attested by the minister of </p><p>war. Such is the mode of authorities.” </p><p>“You, Americano! Carrambal No! Your </p><p>name will provoke distrust. Do you tell us </p><p>they will believe that you, a deserter in time </p><p>of war, would involuntarily give yourself up </p><p>to death?” </p><p> The old man who hurled this bomb con-</p><p>sidered a moment, and then, as the minister, </p><p>who had expected this, was about to speak, </p><p>a light seemed suddenly to break upon him. </p><p> “Pig!” he grunted. “There is'more in</p><p>this than we suspect. Either you and they </p><p>have planned this thing in a way we have </p><p>not perceived, or you blunder. It is not </p><p>that, for you have great intelligence. For </p><p>eso! It is a hoax! Americano, is it not so?” </p><p>For an instant Paddy nearly staggered.</p><p>The little smile hovered upon Pachico’s lips. </p><p> “Do you not understand,” he replied,</p><p>“that the Americanos have stupid ideas </p><p>about such things? For example, among </p><p>your soldiers are a few who have been taken </p><p>by them and then released. Nor have I </p><p>heard that they have executed a deserter in </p><p>this war. Will they not suppose that I am </p><p>aware of their beliefs since I was once as </p><p>they are? They will say, ‘He has induced </p><p>them to come in, for he prefers our prison </p><p>to the high places of the Philippines, pun- </p><p>ishment in his own land to banishment for- </p><p>ever. And he hopes, by this, to atone for </p><p>his crime.’ So will they think and thus will </p><p>they say. You are wrong, as you will see if </p><p>you reflect upon it.” </p><p> “Indeed,” said Pachico, “he speaks in</p><p>good sense. If our scouts at any point de- </p><p>tect a danger, we can still retire even at the </p><p>very town. 1 will yet try this. But if there </p><p>is a mistake or aught we can not understand, </p><p>the Americano must die. Is it not just?” </p><p> It was a strange word for this man to use</p><p>who had dipped into the rice-pot with a </p><p>comrade in order to destroy him, but the </p><p>others answered simply— </p><p> “Jus to!”</p><p> “Then I will complete this and the</p><p>Ministro shall witness it.” </p><p> While the seven maintained a somber si-</p><p>lence, Pachico affixed his signature, majes- </p><p>tically as an emperor. Then he deferred to </p><p>Paddy, who leaned over his shoulder and </p><p>wrote in an awkward scrawl: </p><p>Warmothcrside Ruff, </p><p>Ministro de Guerra, </p><p>Zona 16. </p><p> Paddy straightened up, well content.</p><p>But unexpectedly the familiar curve twisted </p><p>Pachico’s mouth and he extended the letter </p><p>again to the council. </p><p> “Carrajo!” sputtered one. “This is not</p><p>the name he gave us!” </p><p> “That was easy to speak. This is not</p><p>even to be read!” </p><p> “Nor is there a ‘P’ for a beginning! It is</p><p>some character that is neither Visayan nor </p><p>Spanish!” </p><p> Out of the mystery grew suspicion, then</p><p>threats. There is small room for duplicity </p><p>where even truth is doubted. But Paddy </p><p>made one more stand, hoping to deceive </p><p>them only a little longer. It was not intel- </p><p>lect that guided him now, it was the instinct </p><p>of a man at bay. </p><p> “Basta!” he shouted, stamping his foot as</p><p>if in anger. “Why dispute? The name I </p><p>gave you is but a nickname given me by </p><p>the infidels. This is my own. Shall I not </p><p>use it in a message of dignity? It is clear </p><p>that you have lost your confidence in me. </p><p>Be it so! I am tired of trying to please you. </p><p>I will have no more to do with it. Kill me, </p><p>since that appears to be your wish. Let us </p><p>end it. But blame yourselves alone if you </p><p>78 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>spend your lives in the poverty of the out- </p><p>side. Come! Decide!” </p><p> He paused, standing beside Pachico, one</p><p>hand gripping the table, the fingers of the </p><p>other plucking absently behind him at a </p><p>seam in his clothing. It was hard to die </p><p>when everything had promised to end so </p><p>well. All he craved of Heaven, now, as he </p><p>looked questioningly from one to the other, </p><p>was that the end might be sudden and the </p><p>manner of it merciful. </p><p> But he had unconsciously appealed to</p><p>their greed when argument would not have </p><p>moved them. Pachico took a gambler’s </p><p>chance. </p><p> “Let it be as he says,” he decreed, “since</p><p>we choose our own trail.” </p><p> The malcontents assented, distrustful,</p><p>like their master; but good gamesters also, </p><p>as rogues should ever be. </p><p> Thus it came to pass that a courier left,</p><p>early in the morning, for Sogod. They still </p><p>talked of the missing soldier there, and </p><p>many a hunt had the captain led through </p><p>brush and cogon grass till famine and fever </p><p>beat him back again. Some affirmed that </p><p>the one they sought was an excellent rid- </p><p>dance. But they all vowed, nevertheless, </p><p>whenever they trod the wilds, to kill a hun- </p><p>dred for Paddy if they found his bones. </p><p> “He was a man of our company,” said</p><p>they, “worthless or not is no matter. But </p><p>if he deserted, God help him when we get </p><p>him!” </p><p> It happened, upon a night of rest, that</p><p>the captain was puzzling over a rumor the </p><p>natives had spread, which asserted, in sub- </p><p>stance, the design of the hillmen to yield. </p><p>And while he was wondering if Paddy were </p><p>with them, and if so, what he was doing, </p><p>one of the guard presented himself. </p><p> “There’s a gu-gu here, sir, on some kind</p><p>of errand.” </p><p> A mud-smeared, bare-footed cutthroat,</p><p>clad in airy clothing loosely woven of coarse </p><p>hemp, his broad, straw hat in his hand, pat-</p><p>tered in and gave the captain a letter. </p><p>“H’m! Can’t read it.” </p><p> “Visayan?” queried the lieutenant.</p><p>“Uh-hu! Hello! What d’ye think of </p><p>this? It’s from Ruff!” </p><p> He entrusted it to Bryant and summoned</p><p>the sentry. </p><p>“Take that man to the company kitchen, </p><p>give him a meal and hold him until further </p><p>orders. Tell the first-sergeant I want him.” </p><p>The sergeant came, and with many a </p><p>frown and a ponderous pause, translated the </p><p>momentous lines. He was not the scholar </p><p>in this work that Paddy was, perhaps be- </p><p>cause he had learned in a slower school. </p><p>But he did very well. </p><p> “That’s all, sergeant,” the captain said.</p><p>“Say nothing about this and caution the men </p><p>not to discuss that gu-gu around town.” </p><p>“What do you make of it?” he asked when </p><p>they were alone. </p><p> “Looks fishy,” averred the lieutenant.</p><p>“That little red-head has taken up with </p><p>them, apparently, and I suppose he’s try- </p><p>ing to get square, by an ambush, for the </p><p>hours he’s done in the mill.” </p><p> “Well, that may be so, of course,” the</p><p>captain admitted, “but I can’t believe it. </p><p>There’s one thing I’ll bank on in Ruff’s </p><p>case. There’s no yellow streak in him, </p><p>whatever else may be said of him. How </p><p>about it, Scotty?” </p><p> The doctor shook his head in perplexity.</p><p>“It may be as the captain says. The </p><p>vagabond’s forever blundering into trouble, </p><p>but he always gets out with a whole slcin, </p><p>whatever may happen to others. He’s one </p><p>of those seraphically serene individuals who </p><p>scatter misfortune around them in cherubic </p><p>innocence, but usually die peacefully and </p><p>painlessly in their beds at a ripe old age. </p><p>One must have a sense of humor to handle </p><p>him, I’m thinking. In this instance, if he’s </p><p>in sore straits again, mind ye I don’t state </p><p>it for a fact, but it might be it is not his </p><p>own people that will pay the piper.” </p><p> “Well,” mused the captain, “perhaps you</p><p>are right. But if those chaps really mean </p><p>to quit, there’s no reason why they can’t</p><p>just as well come here as for us to go to </p><p>Malavista.” </p><p> Bryant nodded in approbation.</p><p> “That’s what I think. If it’s business,</p><p>they’ll come.” </p><p> “I’ll try them on that basis, at any rate.</p><p>If your idea of an ambush is correct we can </p><p>avoid it in that way; and in any case, we’ll </p><p>discover what truth there is in the proposi- </p><p>tion.” </p><p> He sat down and began to compose an</p><p>answer in Spanish. Presently he stopped. </p><p> “I believe you are right, Bryant. Fur-</p><p>thermore, I’ll bet that Ruff never wrote it. </p><p>He would have done it in English, if he </p><p>and they were in collusion and had meant it </p><p>for what it purports to be. If they were </p><p>sincere they would have had nothing to fear </p><p>from his using his own language. It’s a </p><p>Tlu- One Sheep That Was Lost </p><p>79 </p><p>subterfuge of some sort. Another thing. </p><p>Diil you notice the signature? ‘Ruff’ is </p><p>there all right, but the given name is a jum- </p><p> "Let me see it again.”</p><p> All three studied it carefully. After a</p><p>while Bryant smiled. </p><p> “Do you get this?” He separated the</p><p>words with pencil-marks. </p><p> No one spoke for a moment.</p><p> “I see two possible combinations,” an-</p><p>nounced the captain, “but one is too cryptic </p><p>to have any significance. I take it he is </p><p>telling us to apply heat to the back of this </p><p>thing.” </p><p> “I have heard of such tricks,” affirmed</p><p>the doctor. “It might not be foolish to try </p><p>it.” </p><p> He did so. At first nothing happened.</p><p>Then, faintly but by degrees more plainly, </p><p>there, developed this appeal in sepia-colored </p><p>characters. </p><p>C'APTEN, Sir: </p><p> I did not desert. I will tell you how it was if I</p><p>ever get home. Plese go out on the Malavista trail </p><p>just as it says, only it’s a fake, an’ wait dose. I </p><p>told them you wud all go out an’ then we wud jump </p><p>the convenio. Plese rig a strong bar acrost the out- </p><p>side ov the main store-room doors an’ leve it all </p><p>open but no chow. If you do this capten I will do </p><p>the rest an’ wen you see them go in comc quick. If </p><p>you do not do this it’s me for the ant-hills capten </p><p>plese.	Very respectful,</p><p>Private Ruff. </p><p> “Phew!” exhaled the captain in a whis-</p><p>per of awe and realization. “That’s some </p><p>nerve!” </p><p> “Aye!” commended the doctor. “Adver-</p><p>sity sharpens the wits, that her child, Neces- </p><p>sity, may be satisfied. ’Tis some compen- </p><p>sation, I'm thinking, for one who is knocked </p><p>about the world, that he becomes more </p><p>clever than the rest of us.” </p><p> “You’ll do it?” demanded Bryant almost</p><p>defiantly. “He’s got death before and be- </p><p>hind him, captain.” </p><p> “I’ll follow him to the dot, if I lose my</p><p>commission. We'll start work tonight, Bry- </p><p>ant, getting things quietly arranged in the </p><p>convenio. Suppose you look after that, bear- </p><p>ing in mind the fact that they may finish </p><p>Ruff and get away.” </p><p> “How about the town?”</p><p> “Oh! They know what Pachico is figur-</p><p>ing on, already. You can bank on that. </p><p>Don’t think there’ll be any of them around. </p><p>They know him too well to go after any- </p><p>thing he wants to loot. I’ll leave a volun- </p><p>teer guard for a blind, with directions to </p><p>run when the gu-gus appear. They can </p><p>stop the padre, also, if he comes prying </p><p>around.” </p><p> “Mon,” declared the doctor in some agi-</p><p>tation, “I was never strong for the hero </p><p>work. The sick must go too.” </p><p> The messenger left that very evening and</p><p>reached Pachico’s camp early the next fore- </p><p>noon. </p><p> The heart of Paddy sang when he heard</p><p>the answer read, for his wise captain guaran- </p><p>teed pardons for all, because of their volun- </p><p>tary renunciation of hostilities. </p><p> This settled all doubts among the seven,</p><p>who beamed on Paddy almost worshipfully. </p><p> Notwithstanding, lest some mischance</p><p>occur, he begged more paper for writing or- </p><p>ders during the march, and so obtained pos- </p><p>session of all that he had used. </p><p> At the proper time, when the morning</p><p>breezes shook the] dews from the palms, a </p><p>full company of American soldiers evacuated </p><p>Sogod and disappeared on the Malavista </p><p>trail. The town seemed to be deserted. </p><p> Simultaneously, the red head of Paddy</p><p>Ruff protruded through the thicket on the </p><p>hilltop opposite. </p><p> “He has taken them all, my general, as I</p><p>predicted. The dogs bark no more. Let </p><p>us hum’.”</p><p> Swiftly they descended from the heights,</p><p>a gleeful mob, and ran down the empty </p><p>highway straight for the stone convenio. </p><p> The volunteer guard fired wildly at noth-</p><p>ing in particular, and fled for their lives. </p><p> “The stores, Americano!” howled Pachico.</p><p>“In which of the vaults are the stores and </p><p>the money?” </p><p> “In there, quick!” sobbed Paddy, who</p><p>halted at the great doors. </p><p> Then, into the deep, high, lower story</p><p>pushed and writhed and crowded the loot- </p><p>mad Malays. And when the last had wrig- </p><p>gled in, Paddy crashed the heavy barriers </p><p>together and dropped the long, strong bar </p><p>into place. </p><p> All hell could not equal the screams of</p><p>the demons shut into those walls. They </p><p>hacked at the massive entrance and pried </p><p>at the window-gratings.

I beg yore pardon, Mr. </p><p>Simpkins, did you speak?’ </p><p> “ ‘Go ahead,’ mumbles Magpie, and I</p><p>notices that he’s got all of that seegar in his</p><p>mouth, and seems to be slowly chokin’ </p><p>to death. </p><p> “ ‘As I started to say,’ resumed Peters,</p><p>‘I panned some of th’ drillin’s in this pros- </p><p>pect and what do you suppose I found, gen- </p><p>tlemen?

Foregathered in the Saxon </p><p>Saloon they relaxed their muscles, their </p><p>throats and their poke-strings. </p><p> Motley crowds haunted the bar on one</p><p>side of the huge canvas room, surrounded </p><p>the gaming-tables on the other side, clogged </p><p>the central space where, within a circle of </p><p>chairs, a red-hot stove throbbed like a giant </p><p>engine and overflowed upon the dancing- </p><p>floor at the rear. </p><p> A haze of smoke invested everything,</p><p>blurring the oil-lamps swung from the ridge- </p><p>pole, and softening the uncouth garments </p><p>and rough faces of the men. </p><p> In all quarters, except in the immediate</p><p>vicinity of the tables, where a businesslike </p><p>quiet reigned, was laughter, song and badi- </p><p>nage; was clamor, jest and camaraderie; was </p><p>open hand, open heart and a devil-take-to- </p><p>morrow’s - worry atmosphere. Old-timers, </p><p>hailing from opposite ends of the earth, </p><p>The Hunt-Pack </p><p>85 </p><p>called one another friend and swapped harsh </p><p>experiences, vile tobacco and colossal lies; </p><p>while chechakos, to whom these seared ad- </p><p>venturers were little less than gods, worship- </p><p>ed meekly at their feet, imbibing among </p><p>other things instruction in the ways and </p><p>wiles of the land. </p><p> And with the noise of the main room of</p><p>the Saxon at its height, into it swept like a </p><p>flood the babel of the dance-hall. Blended </p><p>music of violin and piano stopped. Two- </p><p>score couples circling the floor whirled about </p><p>and made a concentrated rush for refresh- </p><p>ments. In a shrieking, giggling, shoving </p><p>mass they surged forth, the women in satins </p><p>and pumps, the men in moccasins and muk- </p><p>luks and fur or mackinaw coats, shaking </p><p>the oil-lamps on the ridge-pole with their </p><p>raucous laughter, swirling the haze of the </p><p>place into strange eddies with the violence </p><p>of their charge. </p><p> For this was a night of rejoicing. This</p><p>was Happy Camp! The Titanic climb of </p><p>storm-harried Chilkoot was past, and the </p><p>trend of the gold-trail now led down the </p><p>mountain and onward by ice-bound lake </p><p>and river to desired Dawson. That many </p><p>who had started up the Pass from Dyea </p><p>had never crossed the Summit, had drowned </p><p>in Dyea River, broken their necks in the </p><p>Canon, got caught near the Scales by shov- </p><p>ing glacier or thundering avalanche, or fall- </p><p>en to frost and blizzard upon the Palisades, </p><p>was not a thing to be remembered at this </p><p>hour. The rest were here, the survivors, </p><p>the fit, the strong, in whom life flowed fierce- </p><p>ly with its primordial pulse, and they were </p><p>reveling in triumph and shouting toasts to </p><p>the trough roof, when the door of the Saxon </p><p>opened and the frost puffed in a fog-bank </p><p>into the superheated room. </p><p>A OUT of the fog-bank stepped two </p><p>figures, a man and a woman, fresh </p><p>from the trail. Their parkas where </p><p>they clung tightly over their backs and </p><p>sagged on their hips were rimmed with </p><p>hoarfrost, advertising body-sweat congealed, </p><p>and about the close-drawn puckers of their </p><p>hoods icicles hung like tusks. </p><p> Upon the two were the unmistakable signs</p><p>of the Chilkoot climb. New recruits to the</p><p>ranks of the strong they seemed, and the </p><p>triumphant army in the Saxon acclaimed </p><p>them with a thunderous cheer. </p><p> The man and the woman held their heads</p><p>over the heat. The icy tusks thawed and </p><p>fell to sizzle and steam upon the glowing </p><p>stove-top. The two shoved back the parka </p><p>hoods and nodded genially to their welcom- </p><p>ers. </p><p> But the moment the newcomers’ faces</p><p>were bared, a thick-set man in moccasins, </p><p>German socks and bearskin coat stagged </p><p>off at the hips, rose up on the other side of </p><p>the stove and peered sharply through the </p><p>steam. Next, an unspoken question in his </p><p>eyes, he gazed significantly at his six com- </p><p>panions around the fire. They likewise </p><p>scrutinized the late arrivals for a keen sec- </p><p>ond, looked back at the thick-set man in </p><p>the stagged-off bearskin and nodded grim- </p><p>ly- </p><p> Whereupon the bearskin-clad one raised</p><p>an authoritative hand amid the bedlam of </p><p>the Saxon. </p><p> At once the din lessened.</p><p> “What’s up, Bassett?” yelled an irre-</p><p>pressible member of the dance crowd. “Rel- </p><p>atives of yours?” </p><p> “Maybe they come through the Chilkoot</p><p>by tunnel and ain’t had the third degree of </p><p>the Pass!” hazarded another facetiously. </p><p>“Tom’s going to find out.” </p><p> But Tom Bassett had stepped swiftly</p><p>round the stove and laid a hand upon the </p><p>shoulder of the man in the parka. </p><p> “What might your name be, stranger?”</p><p> “Karle Lott.”</p><p> “Lie number one! It’s Jose Cantine.</p><p>And who’s the woman with you?” </p><p> “My wife!” He resentfully shook off</p><p>Bassett’s hand. </p><p> “Lie number two, you hound! It’s Eric</p><p>Sark’s wife—vamoosed with in White Pass </p><p>City months and months back! Aw, hold </p><p>up!” Bassett seized the hand that dived </p><p>under the parka and jerked it forth again.</p><p>“You don’t go gunnin’ with me. If you </p><p>was fair game I’d sure let you, but you </p><p>ain’t. My pardner Sark’s got a mortgage </p><p>on you. And if I was over in his place es- </p><p>tablishin’ relay camps on another trail and </p><p>he was here in mine you’d pay right now. </p><p>I’m sufferin’ sorry he ain’t here, but all the </p><p>same it’s a bloody short morator-ee-um </p><p>you’re gittin’, Cantine. Savvy? That’s </p><p>why I’m lettin’ you stay hull-skinned.” </p><p>“Well, if you’re lettin’ me stay whole- </p><p>skinned what you crossin’ me for then?” </p><p>fiercely demanded the man in the parka, </p><p>anger darkening his already dark eyes, tens- </p><p>ing sharper his already sharp features. </p><p>“Mind, I ain’t admittin’ I’m Cantine either. </p><p>86 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>But if I was Cantine, and you ain’t goin’ </p><p>to perforate Cantine on sight, what in </p><p>Hades do you mean?” </p><p> “Mean?” echoed Bassett. “Your gall is</p><p>sure chilled steel and case-hardened on top. </p><p>Do you think as me or any other white </p><p>man’s goin’ to eat, drink or sleep with or </p><p>breathe the same air as you? You as broke </p><p>the bond of bread and blanket, the North- </p><p>land law as no man ever breaks, and lives </p><p>to boast of it! Days on end I seen you sit </p><p>at table with my pardner Sark under his </p><p>own roof in White Pass City. Nights on </p><p>end I seen you smoke by his fireside and </p><p>bed down in his blankets. And with the </p><p>guile of your stinkin’ soul you was plannin’ </p><p>and executin’ his betrayal every blasted </p><p>minute of the time! </p><p> “Then ag’in, do you think as any woman</p><p>in this camp’s goin’ to suffer the compan- </p><p>ionship of yon female you call your wife </p><p>who’s ten times guiltier’n you? The girls </p><p>of Happy Camp is slightly frivolous and </p><p>not what you’d term pernickety, but they </p><p>draw the line at her. And I tell you, Can- </p><p>tine, I draw the line at you. I wouldn’t </p><p>deserve to be called Sark’s pardner if I </p><p>didn’t. I wouldn’t deserve to be called a </p><p>white man if I didn’t. I’m strong for sani- </p><p>tation here. The likes of you two is stench </p><p>and putrefaction in a healthy place. Savvy </p><p>what I mean? You git to blazes outa Hap- </p><p>py Camp!” </p><p> Bassett released the other’s wrist as he</p><p>spoke, and the man, his lips drawn up in a </p><p>wolf-dog’s snarl, stepped back a yard. </p><p> “I’ll be bludgeoned if we do!” he snapped.</p><p>“You ain’t proved anything yet. Anyway </p><p>there ain’t anything to prove.” </p><p> Tom Bassett gazed at him with a wearied</p><p>air and resignedly waved a hand to his </p><p>companions. </p><p> “Who is he, men?” he asked.</p><p> As one man, six of them took pipes out of</p><p>their mouths, lowered their feet from the </p><p>guard-rail of the stove, and spat toward the </p><p>damper. </p><p> “Jose Cantine!” they chorused.</p><p>Immediately their feet went up to the </p><p>guard-rail again, and their pipes went back </p><p>to their mouths. </p><p> “And about the woman!” Bassett paused</p><p>and scanned the throng of dancers. </p><p>“Where’s White-Pass-City Winnie?” he </p><p>asked. “Ain’t she here tonight? I thought </p><p>I seen her yeller dress somewhar. Oh, she’s </p><p>at the back, eh? Well, trot her forrard.” </p><p> The throng shifted, leaving an irregular</p><p>lane in its center. </p><p> Through this lane a fresh-faced girl of</p><p>twenty-four or -five pushed from the rear, </p><p>the rustle of her canary-satin dress and the </p><p>tap-tap of her dainty pumps falling with </p><p>strange distinctness across the silence of </p><p>the Saxon. </p><p> “Winnie, shake hands with an old friend</p><p>of yours!” yawned Bassett. </p><p> White-Pass-City Winnie gave one swift,</p><p>curious glance at the woman by the stove </p><p>and recoiled, her nose in the air. </p><p> “Me? Shake with Blera Sark? Not</p><p>much! And if I’d shamed as good a man </p><p>as Eric Sark for a cur like Jose Cantine </p><p>I’d spare my old friends the sight of my </p><p>face!” </p><p> Winnie, arms folded so tight as to lock</p><p>her hands away from any possible contami- </p><p>nation, flounced back into the front rank of </p><p>the dance-crowd and remained there stand- </p><p>ing on her dignity and her high heels. </p><p> For a little the other woman gazed fixed-</p><p>ly at her scorner. Then her flushed face, </p><p>still handsome in spite of the marring fron- </p><p>tier life, began to quiver and work. Her </p><p>hands clenched upon the breast of her </p><p>parka, and tears splashed down and hissed </p><p>upon the stove. </p><p> “You—you—vixen!” she choked.</p><p> For revelation as well as inexpressible</p><p>hurt was White-Pass-City Winnie’s opinion </p><p>of her social status. </p><p> Yet her shame and her tears had no weak-</p><p>ening effect upon those about her. Bassett </p><p>was gazing significantly at Cantine.</p><p> “No good, Jose!” he shrugged. “Seein’</p><p>as I’m an all-fired, welded and cemented </p><p>pardner of Sark’s, I figgered you wouldn’t </p><p>be anyways partial to my views; I figgered </p><p>you’d be hard-bent on disputin’ my identi- </p><p>fication if ever I spotted you. So I ain’t </p><p>standin’ on my own identification. I’m </p><p>standin’ on the identification of these here </p><p>six men as knowed you along the White </p><p>Pass Trail. I’m standin’ on the identifica- </p><p>tion of White-Pass-City Winnie, who was a </p><p>close friend of Blera Sark’s. What’s more, </p><p>I’ll bet a thousand ounces thar ain’t a per- </p><p>son present as doubts yon evidence. If </p><p>thar is let him speak up for you!” </p><p> Bassett’s challenging glance traveled</p><p>swiftly round the Saxon. The dancing- </p><p>floor was empty, the bar deserted, every </p><p>faro, stud-poker, draw-poker, crap and rou- </p><p>lette table idle. To a man the stakers had </p><p>The Hunt-Pack </p><p>87 </p><p>left their stillest games to hear the contro- </p><p>versy in the middle of the room. And to a </p><p>man they stood with Tom Bassett. No one </p><p>spoke for Cantine. </p><p> “It’s settled!” decided Bassett, whirling</p><p>upon Jose. “And lemme tell you you’re </p><p>gittin’ outa Happy Camp pretty safe. I </p><p>know many’s the camp as would give you </p><p>twenty lashes for stealin’ a rind of bacon. </p><p>And for stealin’ a man’s wife and home and </p><p>hopes and honor—say, Cantine, liquid hell- </p><p>fire ain’t a squirt on what they’d do to you. </p><p>You’re lucky to be goin’ so safe. Now git!” </p><p> “We won’t!” defied Jose recklessly.</p><p>“We’ve come twenty-odd miles, climbed </p><p>nigh four thousand feet, and it’s forty-one </p><p>below zero by the thermometer on the door. </p><p>You can’t turn us out on a night like this.” </p><p> “Kin’t?” growled Bassett. With a quick</p><p>jerk he flipped his watch from his pocket </p><p>on to his open palm. “Sixty seconds I’m </p><p>givin’ you,” he announced. “Walk through </p><p>that door before then or git thrown through </p><p>arter!” </p><p> The Saxon was very still. Bristling like</p><p>a malemiut at bay, Jose Cantine half- </p><p>crouched in front of Bassett, who intently </p><p>held the watch on him. </p><p> “One, two, three, four, five—ten—fif-</p><p>teen—” rasped Bassett’s deep voice mo- </p><p>notonously counting off the seconds. </p><p> Cantine’s coal-black eyes shifted appeal-</p><p>ingly round the room, but the crowd of </p><p>men gazed back at him stolidly. </p><p> “Twenty—thirty—forty—fifty—sixty!”</p><p> Bassett flipped his watch into his pocket</p><p>and jumped. </p><p> As he jumped, Cantine’s hand again dived</p><p>under his parka. He had the Colt out this </p><p>time before Tom grasped his arm. Two </p><p>shots went wild through the stovepipe, but, </p><p>his wrist twisted with a violent wrench, </p><p>Cantine felt the weapon slipping from his </p><p>fingers, felt himself lifted like a doll in Bas- </p><p>sett’s powerful hands and bundled to the </p><p>door.</p><p> In the doorway Bassett poised a second.</p><p>Suddenly he kicked. Cantine hurtled down </p><p>the slope like a football, gaining momentum </p><p>every second, and plunged into a snowdrift </p><p>one hundred yards below. </p><p> “Now, missus-”</p><p> But the woman who had been Blera Sark</p><p>fled past Bassett after Jose. </p><p> “Mebbe you think you’ve run ag’in a</p><p>pretty hard snag in me!” Bassett called </p><p>down the slope to them. “You haven’t. </p><p>I’m a gentle, ministerin’, velvet-fingered </p><p>angel of mercy to what you’ll strike before </p><p>you make Dawson City!” </p><p> He closed the Saxon door against the</p><p>boring frost. </p><p> “The air sure smells better,” he observed,</p><p>sniffing with relief. </p><p> “Sure does,” nodded the old-timers by</p><p>the stove. “But what trail’s your pardner </p><p>plantin’ relay camps on?” </p><p> “The Nordenskold Trail,” answered Bas-</p><p>sett. “That’s the same trail yon two skunks </p><p>is takin’ on from Whitehorse, only they </p><p>dunno it yit. But, ladies and gentlemen,” </p><p>apologizing to the crowd, “I’m sure suffer- </p><p>in’ sorry to be the cause of the delay in </p><p>your fun. Don’t let her delay any longer. </p><p>Go cavortin’ to it!” </p><p> Immediately clamor broke out again.</p><p> Violin and piano struck up.</p><p> The click of the ivory roulette-ball and</p><p>the rattle of dealt cases arose from the ta- </p><p>bles. </p><p> Happy Camp was Happy Camp once</p><p>more, and for it the incident was closed. </p><p>KisSS BUT not for Cantine and the wo- </p><p>SSft man. </p><p>^ She helped the cursing Jose to </p><p>pull himself out of the drift, ancitogether </p><p>they floundered back to the beaten trail. </p><p> In the snow-walled defile they stood a</p><p>moment, gazing upward at the glowing</p><p>lights of Happy Camp and the stark out- </p><p>line of Chilcoot Mountain etched against a </p><p>green night sky. </p><p> With a string of muffled imprecations</p><p>Jose made a move as if to go back up the </p><p>slope, but Blera put her hands on his shoul- </p><p>ders and checked him. </p><p> “Don’t, Jose, don’t!” she besought.</p><p>“They’ll maim and manhandle you till </p><p>you’re a proper cripple. And the word’ll </p><p>go round like a plague. There isn’t any </p><p>tent there for us tonight.” </p><p> “I ain’t seein’ any here either, then,”</p><p>snarled Jose. “You know how light we </p><p>come over the Pass to make it in a day. </p><p>Grub enough for one stop, and 110 blan- </p><p>kets!” </p><p> “Well,” shivered Blera petulantly,</p><p>“there’s lots of fire, isn’t there? What’s the </p><p>use of lamenting in the frost?” </p><p> Happy Camp marked the edge of timber-</p><p>line after the nakedness of the glacier- </p><p>scoured rocks and volcanic slag about Crater </p><p>Lake and the steeps above, and into the </p><p>88 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>first scrubby pines Cantine and the woman </p><p>turned. </p><p> Here was a chaos of dead and splintered</p><p>trunks as thick as a man’s arm, and piling </p><p>these up they kindled a giant fire. Food </p><p>was larking. Yet they melted snow in a </p><p>drinking-cup that Cantine carried in his </p><p>pocket and swallowed great drafts of hot </p><p>water. </p><p> Blankets they were likewise powerless to</p><p>improvise. They simply threw big heaps of </p><p>green spruce boughs beside the fire and, ly- </p><p>ing upon them close to the coals, basked </p><p>and drowsed, warming back and breast al- </p><p>ternately in the terrific cold, and alternately </p><p>rising to drag on fresh fuel. </p><p> Above them in the January night the au-</p><p>rora flashed and dimmed, and the sapphire </p><p>stars leaped with dire prophecy of still in- </p><p>tenser cold. And the January day, when it </p><p>came, was as the night, except that the stars </p><p>vanished and the aurora ceased to play. </p><p>The jagged, sunless world was frigid, stiff </p><p>and white, and the green night sky had </p><p>changed to muddy gray. </p><p> Cantine and Blera arose early, drank</p><p>more hot water and plowed down the ice- </p><p>trail across Deep Lake and Long Lake, an- </p><p>cient volcano pits that with Crater linked </p><p>Lake Linderman to the mountains. </p><p> All about them the stampede was on the</p><p>move, hurrying along the deep trench of </p><p>trampled snow which constituted the trail. </p><p>The throng hauled loaded hand-sleds, drove </p><p>dogs attached to loaded dog-sleds or went </p><p>by man-power under enormous packs. Ever </p><p>these packs were cast down without care at </p><p>the side of the trail while the owners back- </p><p>tripped for more till the side snows were </p><p>heaped with bags, boxes and rope-lashed </p><p>bundles of all descriptions. </p><p> On the right of Cantine and Blera, on</p><p>their left, ahead of them, behind them were </p><p>tons upon tons of provisions, yet they dared </p><p>not put forth their hands to lift a morsel. </p><p>Well they knew the Northland law con- </p><p>cerning wayside caches, and well they knew </p><p>the punishment that fell upon him who </p><p>broke the law. The bitter resentment they</p><p>nursed against Bassett who had ejected </p><p>them from Happy Camp and against all the </p><p>rest who had consented to that ejection </p><p>blazed into a sort of savagery, a hatred of </p><p>their own breed which mocked and tantal- </p><p>ized and ostracized them. </p><p> Every man of that breed bound inward</p><p>had a vision before his eyes and a hope in </p><p>his heart. Each worked in a frenzy and </p><p>performed prodigies of toil for the attain- </p><p>ment of his vision and the realizing of his </p><p>high ambition, but the jaded souls of Can- </p><p>tine and Blera did not respond to any such </p><p>spur. </p><p> From the start they had been under no</p><p>spell but the spell of shallow, garish entice- </p><p>ments; and the unlooked-for collision with </p><p>Tom Bassett and the specter of another day </p><p>had seared them into callousness. Without </p><p>lifting eyes to their companions of the trail </p><p>who passed, met, repassed and oftentimes </p><p>jostled them, they plodded, pariahs of their </p><p>race, down the frozen surface of Long Lake. </p><p> Near Long Lake’s foot a string of seven</p><p>sleds drawn by swift dog-teams, and going </p><p>light, overtook them. They drove down </p><p>upon the two without the customary warn- </p><p>ing hail. </p><p> Cantine and the woman had barely time</p><p>to throw themselves prone into the side </p><p>snow before the lead-dog of the first team, </p><p>ripping at them with vicious fangs, flashed </p><p>past. The other teams flashed after, each </p><p>dog taking the chance to snap futilely at </p><p>their moccasined heels and the drivers with </p><p>raucous laughter flicking their whiplashes </p><p>like long, black snakes into the drifts around </p><p>the heads of the fallen pair. </p><p> Although no blow had been landed on</p><p>them, the demonstration rankled in the </p><p>hearts of Jose and Blera. Blera knew that </p><p>had it not been for the fact that she was a </p><p>woman the blows would surely have been </p><p>sent home and perhaps the wolf - dogs </p><p>swerved from their course to rend them as </p><p>they ran. More bitter still her anger flared, </p><p>and Jose himself quivered with passion as </p><p>he clambered out of the side snow back into </p><p>the trail and reviled the disappearing seven. </p><p>He could not fully identify the befurred </p><p>and parka-clad drivers, but he had a suspi- </p><p>cion that they were Tom Bassett and the</p><p>six men who had sat around the stove the </p><p>night before in the Saxon Saloon. </p><p> On down to Lake Linderman, the end of</p><p>the twenty-eight-mile portage over Chilcoot </p><p>from Dyea Beach, he carried his suspicion, </p><p>and there at Linderman Landing he found </p><p>his suspicions justified. </p><p> The shore of the lake was dotted with log-</p><p>cabins, half-log and half-canvas cabins and </p><p>flimsy tents, standing where the whipsaws </p><p>had swept the trees away. On the edge of </p><p>the main trail just at the dip to the ice </p><p>bulked the Linderman Restaurant run by </p><p>The Hunt-Pack </p><p>89 </p><p>Flambald. It flaunted a huge cotton sign </p><p>painted with pies and prices and advertised </p><p>a satiating meal for ten dollars in gold. In- </p><p>stinctively Cantine and Blera increased </p><p>their pace as they made for it. </p><p> There was a crowd about the door. Can-</p><p>tine went to push through and suddenly re- </p><p>coiled. Tom Bassett lounged on one end of </p><p>the log door-step with his back against the </p><p>log wall. </p><p> “What’s the matter, Cantine?” grinned</p><p>Tom derisively. “Ain’t you hungry?” </p><p>Cantine put out a hand for his compan- </p><p>ion and gingerly, his eyes watching Bassett </p><p>for an untoward action, moved over the </p><p>door-step. He seemed astounded that he </p><p>got across untouched. He looked back </p><p>over his shoulder uncertainly, half paused </p><p>and went on again toward the tables. Bas- </p><p>sett had never moved a muscle. Only Can- </p><p>tine could see the derisive profile of his nose, </p><p>cheek and mouth as he leaned against the </p><p>outside wall, and the sight awoke in Jose </p><p>queer premonitions. </p><p> Nevertheless he boldly handed Blera into</p><p>a chair and waited for some one to take his </p><p>order. No one came. Jose beckoned mad- </p><p>ly, but the waiters were always busy. They </p><p>nodded, but they never came. In the fury </p><p>of his hunger Jose leaped up and rushed </p><p>over to the plank desk where Flambald took </p><p>the money for the waiters’ checks. </p><p> “Look here!” he flared. “We’re famished,</p><p>and your waiters are a lot of dummies. </p><p>Send some one round with grub.” </p><p>Flambald, a man of colossal and un - </p><p>healthy girth, looked at him over the plank </p><p>desk. </p><p> “You go to condemnation!” he bellowed.</p><p>“You aren’t eating here.” </p><p> “Why? What in-”</p><p> “Stop!” roared Flambald. “This is my</p><p>house. I feed who I like, but you I don’t </p><p>like. Savvy?” </p><p> Jose savvied.</p><p> Flambald’s hand was on a huge iron pa-</p><p>per-weight that held his bills upon the plank </p><p>desk, and there was no arguing. Jose si- </p><p>lently beckoned Blera and slunk out again. </p><p> On the door-step lounged Bassett, and</p><p>Jose turned in the trail to curse him futile- </p><p>ly. He knew better than to try any other </p><p>restaurant. Bassett had passed the word. </p><p>His receptions would be all the same. Also </p><p>he knew better than to try force. He had </p><p>had his lesson from that up by timberline. </p><p>Besides, Blera’s hand was on his arm, fear- </p><p>fully dragging him on down Linderman’s </p><p>frozen bosom. </p><p> Thus began a grim game in which Bas-</p><p>sett was persecution personified, a Nemesis </p><p>unshakable. He passed them on Lake Lin- </p><p>derman, welcomed them at Bennett Post, </p><p>and once more showed them the tail of his </p><p>sled halfway down to West Arm on Ben- </p><p>nett Lake. </p><p> That night they spent much like the pre-</p><p>ceding one, feeding a gigantic fire, drinking </p><p>inconceivable quantities of hot water and </p><p>gnawing mangy dried salmon purchased at </p><p>a Stick Indian teepee on Lake Bennett’s </p><p>shore. </p><p> Thenceforward Bassett’s hand as well as</p><p>the hand of every other man was against </p><p>them up the chain of lakes. The white </p><p>breed of the land was a hunt-pack turned </p><p>upon them, and though by virtue of stray </p><p>Indian camps they survived through Cari- </p><p>bou Crossing, Tagish Post and McClintock </p><p>Post to Whitehorse, Bassett beat them in </p><p>the end. </p><p> For on the Fifty-mile River beyond the</p><p>Whitehorse camp his dog-sled passed them </p><p>once again, and the next far post was Sel- </p><p>kirk at the Pelly’s mouth. </p><p> “Jose, how many miles to Selkirk?” asked</p><p>Blera as they stared after the vanishing out- </p><p>fit. </p><p> “More’n two hundred and fifty,” an-</p><p>swered Jose dejectedly. “Bassett’s got us, </p><p>sure.” </p><p> “No, he hasn’t, then!” Blera’s blue eyes</p><p>flashed in the frost, and she shook her fur- </p><p>gantleted hand in Bassett’s wake. “He’s </p><p>aiming to starve us out on the river-stretch</p><p>and make us quit it again, but it’ll take a </p><p>sore sight more than him to do it!” </p><p> “How you meaning? We can’t make Sel-</p><p>kirk on hot water and dog-feed.” </p><p> “I know that, but there’s the Dalton</p><p>Trail.” </p><p> “By thunder! Say, I hadn’t figured on</p><p>that track! But it’ll do. Blera, you’re sure </p><p>a—a—a winner. I know there’s a Stick </p><p>village at the mouth of the Klokhok—old </p><p>Tutchi’s Village. I’ve been in it often. The </p><p>beggars is rich. They’re lousy with dogs, </p><p>and we’ll dicker for some and go down the </p><p>Middle Fork of the Nordenskold. After </p><p>that, Dawson’s dead easy with dogs. And </p><p>in Dawson we’ll lie low till we get a chance </p><p>to square up with Mister Bassett. Come </p><p>on!” </p><p> Endowed with redoubled energy at his</p><p>90 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>bettered prospects, Jose turned and sped </p><p>of! in a long lurching snowshoe stride for the </p><p>mouth of the Takhini River which emptied </p><p>into the Fifty-mile halfway between White- </p><p>horse and Lake Laberge. </p><p> They turned up the Takhini, sometimes</p><p>called the Mendenhall since both these riv- </p><p>ers joined to form the larger stream which </p><p>emptied into the Fifty-mile, the Menden- </p><p>hall draining Taye Lake lying to the west- </p><p>ward on the Dalton Trail and the Takhini </p><p>flowing north by east from Kusawa Lake </p><p>between the Yukon River and the Deza- </p><p>deash country. </p><p> Cantine and Blera were traveling almost</p><p>due westward. On their left to the south </p><p>lay Haeckel Hill. On their right to the </p><p>north loomed the Miner’s Range, and on the </p><p>far horizon beyond the valley of the tribu- </p><p>tary Klokhok jutted higher, nameless peaks. </p><p>In interminable vastness the land spread </p><p>before them, virgin ground oft from the </p><p>main-traveled trail to Dawson City, and the </p><p>stupendous extent of it was enough to strike </p><p>fear into the human heart. </p><p> But Cantine had no fear. In the lonely</p><p>expanse he knew the spot where was life and </p><p>warm teepees and food. Tutchi was a chief, </p><p>and he kept his village in a fairly sanitary </p><p>condition, a condition immeasurably supe- </p><p>rior to that of the squalid teepees to be found </p><p>along the Yukon basin. Cantine had been </p><p>there and he knew, and up the Takhini’s </p><p>smooth ice he pressed at a furious pace, the </p><p>beast instinct of him yearning for food and </p><p>the human side of him yearning for a place </p><p>where he might without dread of contume- </p><p>ly take on again the status of the white. </p><p> Jose’s sentiments were in a degree re-</p><p>flected in his companion. She ran at his </p><p>heels with the swing of the Northwoman </p><p>trained to the trails, and she seemed to have </p><p>no difficulty in keeping his pace. </p><p>BTHE Klokhok River they sought </p><p>flowed south along the base of the </p><p>Miner’s Range into the Takhini. All </p><p>afternoon they held on-for it and at night </p><p>swung suddenly to the right into its spruce- </p><p>fringed mouth. Yonder by the fringe of </p><p>spruce on the low bench-land was the site</p><p>of Tutchi’s Village, but to Cantine’s aston- </p><p>ished eyes there glowed no teepee fires be- </p><p>tween the black trunks. </p><p> “Blazes!” he exclaimed in alarm as he</p><p>surveyed the bare bench-land. “She’s gone, </p><p>Blera. And how in tarnation’s that? It </p><p>wasn’t just a camping-ground. It was a </p><p>permanent village. But maybe they’ve </p><p>shifted up-stream or back in the range. </p><p>Let’s see if there’s a trail.” </p><p> With a swift pang of fear and loneliness</p><p>caused by she knew not what, Blera me- </p><p>chanically followed Cantine as he skimmed </p><p>up the snow-sheeted ice alongside the Klok- </p><p>hok’s left limit. In that moment of non- </p><p>discovery of the village the inimical wild </p><p>crept close to her. She saw it as a con- </p><p>crete force, strong, sure, ruthless as the per- </p><p>secuting Bassett or the avenging hand of </p><p>Eric Sark. </p><p> Her fear grew upon her so that she drew</p><p>near to Jose in his search, her hand on his </p><p>elbow, and skimmed with him stride by </p><p>stride. Her eyes were furtively turned to </p><p>the dark spruce forests crowding on either </p><p>side, while the eyes of her companion scru- </p><p>tinized the snowy bank. That was why </p><p>neither of them marked the scum ice, fragile </p><p>mask of an unfrozen spring, straight ahead. </p><p> They did not mark it, but the moment it</p><p>rattled and shaled off against the frames of </p><p>their shoes their trained ears telegraphed </p><p>the danger. Instinctively both made a vio- </p><p>lent half-turn in mid-stride, but the move- </p><p>ment was not enough to carry them clear. </p><p>It served only to jerk them against each </p><p>other, and together they sank to their </p><p>shoulders through the scum ice. </p><p> The Klokhok’s waters were as cold as the</p><p>vault of death. </p><p> For an instant the contact paralyzed the</p><p>two. Then their arms fell like flails upon </p><p>the rotten shell about them. For yards </p><p>they broke their way to shore and pulled </p><p>themselves like leaden-footed divers up the </p><p>bank. </p><p> A clump of blasted spruce stood on the</p><p>shore, and, struggling against the clog of </p><p>their garments which were setting as hard </p><p>as armor, they madly tore down armfuls of</p><p>the boughs. </p><p> “Jose, the matches!” gasped Blera, drop-</p><p>ping on her knees beside the pile. “Give </p><p>them to me. I’ll light it. You pile on more. </p><p>Don’t stop piling!” </p><p> Jose snatched up the stiff, crackling front</p><p>of his parka and dabbed his numbing fin- </p><p>gers into the pocket of his vest where he </p><p>kept his matches in a little bottle tightly </p><p>corked, the best waterproof match-safe the </p><p>Northman knows. </p><p> Even as he jabbed his fingers in he ut-</p><p>tered a cry of pain and jerked them out again. </p><p>The Hunt-Pack </p><p>9i </p><p> The ends showed all bloody and studded</p><p>with bits of broken glass. </p><p> Pallor swept Cantine’s swarthy face till</p><p>he looked like a statue in bronze as he stood </p><p>staring stupidly at his finger - ends and </p><p>watching the hot blood freeze. </p><p> “Jose! Jose!”</p><p> Blera’s voice rang thin as a wail in the</p><p>frosty stillness. </p><p> She sprang to Jose, seized on the cloth of</p><p>his vest and pushed the pocket inside out </p><p>from the bottom so that the contents fell </p><p>into the palm of her left gantlet. </p><p> Mingled with the broken glass of the bot-</p><p>tle was a muddled mass of splintered match- </p><p>stumps and sodden heads. </p><p> “Must have done it in the fall!” quavered</p><p>Jose, still staring stupidly. “I felt your </p><p>snowshoe take me hard in the ribs when </p><p>we went down.” </p><p> But Blera did not heed.</p><p> She was kneeling again by the pile of</p><p>spruce branches, scratching match-head af- </p><p>ter match-head. </p><p> None of them would light despite her</p><p>frantic and repeated trials. In despair she </p><p>threw the sodden mass into the unlit pile of </p><p>twigs and turned again to Cantine. </p><p> “Your Colt, Jose!” she appealed, rising</p><p>stiffly. “Your Colt! You can start it with </p><p>a shot!” </p><p> “My Colt?” Cantine looked bewildered.</p><p>The frost seemed to be deadening his senses </p><p>already. “My Colt, Blera? Oh, yes. Bas- </p><p>sett took it, ’way back at Happy Camp!” </p><p> “Good God!” screamed Blera, remember-</p><p>ing. </p><p> She threw out her arms, weakly trying to</p><p>fight up circulation, and a second time the </p><p>ruthless spirit of the wild came very close. </p><p> To her terrified eyes it seemed to leap</p><p>out of the darkness of the spruce, a mate- </p><p>rial presence, and mock her with a shout </p><p>that reverberated across the fireless land. </p><p> It rushed upon her. She could hear the</p><p>crunch-crunch of its footsteps in the crust. </p><p>Its grip fell upon her shoulder, and she </p><p>shrieked insanely. </p><p> “Steady, missus, steady!” soothed a</p><p>mumbling, half-articulate voice. </p><p> And not till the spoken words smote on</p><p>her consciousness could she realize that the </p><p>material presence was a humble man. Then </p><p>she gave a little moan of relief and put out </p><p>a hand for Jose to share in her discovery. </p><p> In the arctic gloom they could not see</p><p>the man’s face at all, but they gathered that </p><p>he had been disturbed at supper by their </p><p>cries, for he was capless and coatless. Also </p><p>he held in his hand a generous slab of pilot- </p><p>bread, and this it was which, cramming his </p><p>mouth, rendered his speech so inarticulate. </p><p>Wildly leading the race, the bread in his </p><p>left hand and Blera’s frozen gantlet in his </p><p>right, he hurtled them over the snows be- </p><p>tween the spruce trees and banged them </p><p>into his cabin doorway. </p><p> At their advent five wolf-dogs leaped up</p><p>snarling from their rest beside the stove. </p><p> “Lie down!” gurgled Cantine’s and</p><p>Blera’s rescuer. </p><p> He kicked the dogs soundly in the ribs</p><p>till they retreated into the huge empty </p><p>wood-box that stood behind the stove. </p><p> “I don’t like the brutes inside,” he mum-</p><p>bled, still wrestling convulsively to get rid </p><p>of the gagging pilot-bread, “but it’s a case </p><p>of have to keep them inside or get them </p><p>eaten whole. Tutchi’s Village is full of sav- </p><p>age semi-wolves, and they run the river in </p><p>a hunt-pack every night.” </p><p> “Tutchi’s Village!” exclaimed Cantine,</p><p>his teeth clicking incessantly as he whacked </p><p>the ice from his garments. “Where’s it </p><p>moved to? It was hunting sign of it we </p><p>fell in.” </p><p> “Moved five miles up the Klokhok,”</p><p>spluttered the other, setting the stove-door</p><p>ajar to obtain a floor-streamer of light in </p><p>the gloomy cabin. “But you better strip </p><p>quick. Use that back room there to change. </p><p>You’ll find a dunnage-bag full of clothes— </p><p>some of them woman’s things—under the </p><p>bunk. While you throw them on, I’ll rus- </p><p>tle more wood to stoke up the stove. I </p><p>used all I had in to cook supper. And you </p><p>can light the candle on the shelf there to </p><p>see by. I was just getting up to reach for </p><p>it when I heard your yells!” </p><p> Gulping down the last of his pilot-bread,</p><p>the owner of the cabin was gone while he </p><p>spoke. </p><p> Cantine reached up to the shelf, took off</p><p>the tallow candle stuck in a wide-necked </p><p>pickle-bottle, reached a box of matches from </p><p>the same shelf and lighted the wick. </p><p> From force of habit he fingered up a small</p><p>bunch of matches out of the box and went </p><p>to shove them into his vest pocket. </p><p> “Wait, Jose, wait!” cautioned Blera.</p><p>“They’ll be as bad as the others if you put </p><p>them there. Put them in the dry clothes, </p><p>and after this don’t trust a bottle any more. </p><p>Get one of those rubber match-safes with </p><p>9 2 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the screw top. And now for the dry clothes! </p><p>I feel as if I can work my arms and legs </p><p>once more.” </p><p> Taking the candle from Jose, she moved</p><p>across the cabin toward the door of the </p><p>back room. The yellow light flooding the </p><p>main room showed it to be built of the cus- </p><p>tomary spruce logs chinked with moss and </p><p>plastered with mud. </p><p> The floor was of rough-hewn slabs. Of</p><p>slabs, too, but a little better smoothed, was </p><p>the rude table upon which supper was </p><p>spread. The table stood under the window </p><p>which instead of glass for a light boasted a </p><p>square of golden-brown moose-skin rubbed </p><p>so smooth as to be almost transparent. </p><p> Upon the opposite wall was a bunk also</p><p>formed of slabs. The Yukon stove stood at </p><p>the end, and it, with the wood-box behind, </p><p>completed the furnishings of the cabin. </p><p> Out of the empty wood-box the huskies</p><p>raised their heads and growled so ominously </p><p>at Blera’s and Jose’s movements that the </p><p>two ran the last few steps across the floor and </p><p>shut the door of the back room with a bang. </p><p> The back room was but a logged-in an-</p><p>nex to the main room and without window </p><p>or door. A bunk constituted its only fur- </p><p>nishing, and it appeared to be used as a </p><p>store-room, for grub-bags and odds and </p><p>ends were piled neatly in its corners. </p><p> Blera set the candle on a pile of sacks</p><p>and ferreted out the dunnage-bag from un- </p><p>der the bunk. Its lashings were loose, and </p><p>she tumbled the contents out on the floor </p><p>where each could pick what was needed. </p><p> The rapid run from the river to the cabin</p><p>and the genial atmosphere of the cabin it- </p><p>self had somewhat warmed their blood as </p><p>well as partly thawed their mail-like gar- </p><p>ments. Hastily they ripped off the clammy </p><p>parkas, mackinaws and woolens and began </p><p>the process of replacing them with dry ones. </p><p> For the most part Blera dressed like Jose</p><p>in arctic underwear, flannel shirt, German </p><p>socks and moccasins, but when it came to </p><p>outer garments she searched in the heart of</p><p>the disorderly pile on the floor for the wo- </p><p>man’s things the owner of the cabin had </p><p>mentioned. </p><p> Finally she fished them out, a buckskin</p><p>waist and a mackinaw skirt with a pro- </p><p>nounced plaid pattern. </p><p> The waist went on like any waist, but at</p><p>sight of the skirt Blera’s breath whistled in </p><p>her throat. Her face convulsed in an ap- </p><p>palling discovery. She held the plaid mack- </p><p>inaw close to the candle, examining the </p><p>band and the vent at the back. </p><p> “What’s wrong with it?” asked Cantine,</p><p>looking up from his own dressing. “Lousy?” </p><p>“Jose, it’s the same! Here’s the band </p><p>leather sewn on to keep the sheath-knife </p><p>from wearing it and the hooks and eyes of </p><p>copper wire on the vent. Jose, it’s my skirt! </p><p>And he’s-” </p><p> “Sark!” roared Jose.</p><p> Terror transformed Can tine’s features.</p><p>He wildly scanned the walls of the back </p><p>room for window or door, but, as he remem- </p><p>bered now, there was no window or door. </p><p> “Blera, we’re trapped!” he faltered with</p><p>a great revelation. “We’re trapped, and </p><p>Bassett’s done it. This is the trail his part- </p><p>ner was putting relay camps on, the Nor- </p><p>denskold Trail. The road down the Middle </p><p>Fork runs right here. Why in Hades didn’t </p><p>we watch where we were going?” </p><p> Blera, unanswering, held the mackinaw</p><p>skirt spread out in her hands. She was </p><p>trembling from head to foot, and her eyes </p><p>stared wide under the surge of emotion, </p><p>jumbled emotion, fear, remorse, anxiety, </p><p>longing, despair. </p><p> “Bassett’s done it!” repeated Jose.</p><p>“Curse his bloody heart, he knew where his </p><p>partner was. He knew if he closed the Yu- </p><p>kon against us we’d have to travel the Nor- </p><p>denskold. I wish, to blue brimstoned blazes, </p><p>I’d been quicker with my Colt that night </p><p>up at—but what in thunder’s the use of </p><p>raving?” He stopped short in his furious </p><p>passion. “We got to do something. We </p><p>got to do it mighty sudden. Blera, what in </p><p>tarnation can we do without dogs, arms or</p><p>grub?” </p><p> . “I don’t know what we can do,” answered</p><p>Blera, breathing as if she were sobbing, “but </p><p>we got to get out of here. Put on dry par- </p><p>kas and draw the hoods close and beat it. </p><p>Maybe we can get out before he comes in. </p><p>If we don’t, tell him—tell—him we got to </p><p>keep right on. Tell him your brother’s sick </p><p>up in the Miner’s Range. Here’s a bullet </p><p>knocking around in the dunnage-bag. Put </p><p>it in your mouth, and it’ll help change your </p><p>voice some. And for God’s sake let’s keep </p><p>our parka hoods drawn tight.” </p><p>BLERA dropped the plaid mack- </p><p>inaw skirt and, contorting feverish- </p><p>ly, they both donned parkas and </p><p>pulled open the door. </p><p> But as they stepped out into the main</p><p>The Hunt-Pack </p><p>93 </p><p>room of the cabin the door of it rattled, was </p><p>kicked back, and both his arms full, Sark </p><p>staggered in with the wood. </p><p> Instantly, as before, the five huskies leap-</p><p>ed viciously across the floor at Jose and </p><p>Blera. </p><p> Sark let fall his load, caught up a single</p><p>billet and belabored the beasts over the </p><p>heads. </p><p> “Down, Skookum! Down, Culuk!” he</p><p>yelled. “Get to blazes behind the stove!” </p><p>He overcame their stubborn resistance and </p><p>hammered them into submission. “Now </p><p>stay behind it, you savages!” </p><p> He turned apologetically to his guests.</p><p> “But hold on!” he exclaimed, noting the</p><p>drawn parka hoods which allowed only </p><p>their eyes to be seen. “You’re not for hit- </p><p>ting the trail again tonight, eh?” </p><p> “We got to,” twanged Jose, the bullet in</p><p>his mouth altering his voice and causing </p><p>him to enunciate through his nose. “We </p><p>got to get along on the jump. My broth- </p><p>er’s sick up in the Miner’s Range, up on the </p><p>headwaters of the Klokhok. We got to </p><p>keep going tonight, for I sent him word I’d </p><p>reach him tomorrow.” </p><p> “Thunder!” exclaimed Sark. “That’s dif-</p><p>ferent. And I’m sorry. But you eat before </p><p>you travel. You and your missus need solid </p><p>grub and steaming drink after yon bath. I </p><p>was just taking the last bite myself. </p><p>There’s lots of pilot-bread and moose meat </p><p>and hot coffee on the stove. Dig in!” </p><p> Sark waved a hand toward the laden table.</p><p> Blera who, although the parka hood con-</p><p>cealed every part of her face but her eyes, </p><p>could not forbear averting her head, turned </p><p>slightly and took a sidelong glance at Eric </p><p>Sark. As she viewed the familiar figure so </p><p>clear in the candlelight, big of limb and of </p><p>chest, blue-eyed, granite-featured, with the </p><p>raven-black in his beard and hair, she had </p><p>an almost unconquerable desire to cry out </p><p>or to run. </p><p> Yet she did neither.</p><p> She remained stone-still till her eyes en-</p><p>countered those of Cantine and strayed with </p><p>them to the food upon the table. </p><p> After their days of hunger it was a great</p><p>temptation, and they fell. Flight delayed, </p><p>and still trusting to the masks of their parka </p><p>hoods, they stretched out ravenous hands </p><p>and munched fiercely upon the bread and </p><p>meat and gulped the steaming coffee. </p><p> Jose removed the bullet from his mouth</p><p>while he ate, but both he and Blera were </p><p>careful to sit backing the tallow-candle </p><p>which Sark placed upon its shelf again, so </p><p>that their faces were cast in gloom. </p><p> Sark, to maintain the part of host, picked</p><p>up the remainder of the slab of pilot-bread </p><p>he had carried when he rescued them and </p><p>poured himself another cup of coffee. </p><p> “What might your name be, stranger?”</p><p>he asked. </p><p> Blera started, the piece of moose-shoulder</p><p>she was munching slipping to the floor. </p><p> “Karle Lott!” coughed Jose through the</p><p>drink he snatched. </p><p> “Mine’s Eric Sark.”</p><p> Dreading another personal question, Ble-</p><p>ra bent low by the table-edge to pick up the </p><p>meat. </p><p> But Skookum, the most cunning as well</p><p>as the most evil of the wolf-dogs, had seen </p><p>it fall and stolen from behind the stove. He </p><p>leaped as Blera reached for it and, losing it </p><p>by the fraction of a second, slashed with his </p><p>chisel-sharp fangs at her face. </p><p> The fangs fell short of the flesh, but met</p><p>in the parka hood and tore it from her head. </p><p> Unmasked, the woman sprang away from</p><p>the brute with a violent scream. </p><p> “Blera!” Sark’s vicious voice thundered</p><p>in the cabin. </p><p> Swift as his wolf-dog he sprang up.</p><p> For a moment he stared at her as across</p><p>a gulf, his blue eyes blazing. Then the light- </p><p>ning-fire of his glance struck her companion. </p><p> “You can drop your hood, too, Cantine!”</p><p> With the ultimatum Sark’s fingers slid</p><p>back and seized the rifle lying in his bunk </p><p>on the wall, for he looked to see a weapon </p><p>flash in Cantine’s hand and guessed that </p><p>one of them had traveled his last trail. </p><p> But Blera was upon him on the instant,</p><p>pressing down the gun. </p><p> “You can’t harm us, Eric! You can’t</p><p>harm us!” she declared hysterically. “You </p><p>can’t touch us here, people you’ve broken </p><p>bread with under your own roof. You know </p><p>that’s the Northland law!” </p><p> Again Sark stared at her as across a gulf</p><p>and dropped the rifle on the bunk. </p><p> “You’re right,” he admitted slowly, nod-</p><p>ding his head as if she had expounded some </p><p>all-powerful decree. “Though laws aren’t </p><p>worth a Siwash curse to you two, they are </p><p>to me. You’re safe—for the night. Be- </p><p>cause now I savvy that ‘brother in the Mi- </p><p>ner’s Range’ was only lyin’ bluff.” </p><p> “But look here, Sark,” whined Jose,</p><p>94 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Stop right up! I’d sure palaver with a</p><p>murdering Sundowner. I’d sure palaver </p><p>with a cannibal Hoonah. But I won’t </p><p>palaver with you. I’m telling you you’re </p><p>safe under this roof. Out from under it you </p><p>take your chance. I’ll give you an hour’s </p><p>clear start in the morning, and then, by </p><p>thunder, look out for me! Now jump into </p><p>that back room quick, the both of you. </p><p>Jump in, I say, for fear I forget I’ve broken </p><p>bread under my own roof with you!” </p><p> The intensity of Sark’s passion heaved</p><p>and tore at his mighty chest and vibrated </p><p>in his smashing voice. </p><p> They did not want him to forget. They</p><p>had the temporary saving grace of the night </p><p>hours. Much might perhaps be accomplish- </p><p>ed in those hours, and with that idea in </p><p>their degenerate minds Cantine and the </p><p>woman slunk into the logged-in annex and </p><p>shut the door. </p><p> As if he were already slamming lead into</p><p>Cantine’s body, Sark slammed stick after </p><p>stick into the stove. </p><p> Then, although it was still early in the</p><p>evening, he blew out the candle and threw </p><p>himself upon his bunk, lying on hip and el- </p><p>bow, resting his head on his hand and star- </p><p>ing like a graven image at the flame-dance </p><p>on the darkened walls of the cabin. </p><p> Blera, peering through a chink in the</p><p>back-room door, watched him thus hour by </p><p>hour. It was a strange and weary vigil, but </p><p>on after midnight his head slipped down </p><p>from his hand. </p><p> “Jose,” she breathed, “he’s asleep.</p><p>Now’s our chance. But we have to have </p><p>the rifle to make our get-away good. Then </p><p>you can stand him off. I’ll take the gun. </p><p>I’m lighter than you, and the slab floor’s </p><p>awful creaky.” </p><p> Cautiously she slipped out of the back</p><p>room and as cautiously, inch by inch, edged </p><p>across the main room toward Sark’s bunk. </p><p> Her figure as she crept was now lost in</p><p>shadow, now etched out faintly by the leap- </p><p>ing flamelight. She moved apparently with-</p><p>out stepping, with the peculiar gliding grace </p><p>that is the inheritance of North-born people. </p><p> The irregularities of the slab floor seemed</p><p>to lose stability, to become fluid and flow </p><p>under her feet like waves in a rapid. Not </p><p>once did her moccasined toes strike knot or </p><p>seam. Not once did the limber slabs shriek </p><p>as they bowed and sprung. Not once did </p><p>the sleeping huskies stir from their dreams </p><p>by the stove. She reached the bunk, and </p><p>her mobile fingers closed on the weapon. </p><p> Sark faced outward as he slept.</p><p> The rifle lay on the blankets between his</p><p>back and the wall, free of his touch except </p><p>where his shoe-packed foot curled over the </p><p>heel of the stock. </p><p> Blera had the rifle by the barrel, and</p><p>slowly, with a motion so gentle as to be </p><p>scarcely perceptible, she began to twist loose </p><p>the butt. </p><p> She had nearly succeeded when she saw</p><p>the twitching of muscles round Sark’s </p><p>closed eyes. </p><p> Swiftly she released the weapon and with</p><p>a lithe swing of her body stretched herself </p><p>along the outer edge of the bunk. Her arms </p><p>were about Sark’s neck, and her voice was </p><p>whispering in his ear when he half awoke. </p><p> “Eric,” she whispered hurriedly, hyster-</p><p>ically, “I’ve come back—stolen out of there </p><p>while he slept. We got to go away—to- </p><p>gether. He was never-” </p><p> But Sark awakened fully.</p><p> “You cursed vampire!” he gritted. “Get</p><p>off. Get away from me. I don’t want the </p><p>touch of your hands. Aren’t you seeing </p><p>you’re poison and pollution to me?” </p><p> He half arose on one knee, roughly thrust-</p><p>ing her from the bunk, and even as he re- </p><p>pulsed her, the touch of her arms brought </p><p>the thrill of another day, a day when his </p><p>hours had been full of dream and desire, of </p><p>marvel and of miracle, when Blera had been </p><p>a splendor and a vision to him and lain in </p><p>honor by his side. </p><p> For a reeling moment he saw not this</p><p>woman who was poison and pollution to </p><p>him. His eyes were fixed, seer-like, upon </p><p>the panels of those vanished days, upon </p><p>the words and smiles and deeds and de- </p><p>lights of another woman tapestried in gold- </p><p>en story upon the snow-white curtain of </p><p>the North, days before he had come into </p><p>the companionship of Tom Bassett and dis- </p><p>covered the love that passeth the love of </p><p>woman. </p><p> And that short moment of Sark’s unwari-</p><p>ness was his undoing and Blera’s oppor- </p><p>tunity. Right before his unseeing eyes her </p><p>swift hands grasped the rifle, and like an- </p><p>other Delilah, turned Philistine against her </p><p>Samson, she crashed the butt across his tem- </p><p>ple. </p><p> Sark’s face turned blank. He quivered a</p><p>little, poised on one knee, and collapsed in </p><p>the bunk. </p><p> “Jose, quick!”</p><p>The Hunt-Pack </p><p>95 </p><p> But she did not need to cry. Cantine</p><p>had seen from the chink in the back-room </p><p>door and run as she struck. </p><p> “Blera, you didn’t-”</p><p> “No, no! Only stunned! And he’s stir-</p><p>ring already. Be sharp! Get the dog-har- </p><p>ness. Down, you brutes!” </p><p> The awakened dogs had sprung up snarl-</p><p>ing, but Blera had a formidable weapon in </p><p>the rifle, and she bludgeoned them on the </p><p>heads with the butt. Jose, too, sprang for </p><p>the long-lashed dog-whip, coiled on pegs on </p><p>the wall, and flayed them into subjection. </p><p>“Now the harness, quick, Jose!” </p><p> Still using the butt of his whip to keep</p><p>the victory already gained, Cantine threw </p><p>the harness on the ugly beasts and haled </p><p>them out into the piercing cold. Blera toss- </p><p>ed down the sled up - ended by the door. </p><p>Rapidly they traced in the huskies, whining </p><p>resentfully at being lashed and dragged from </p><p>the warmth of the cabin out into a tem- </p><p>perature of fifty-five below, and cast them- </p><p>selves on the sled. </p><p> “Mush!” roared Cantine, bringing down</p><p>the whip. </p><p> Under the dreaded lash the shivering</p><p>team dashed down the bank and headed up </p><p>the ice of the Klokhok. The steel-shod sled- </p><p>runners shrieked a shrill tune. The ice </p><p>boomed to their flying passage. </p><p> High in the heavens overhead flashed the</p><p>brilliant stars and the mid-Winter aurora. </p><p>There was in the hearts of Blera and Jose </p><p>no remorse, no regret, not even pity. There </p><p>was only devilish recklessness and the sheer </p><p>exultation of escape. Continually they </p><p>urged on the dogs to greater speed, lashing </p><p>them till Skookum the leader flung up his </p><p>nose as he galloped and howled a protest. </p><p> And challenging Skookum’s howl, from</p><p>around the abrupt bend they were taking at </p><p>express-train speed broke the tumultuous </p><p>cry of many wolf-dogs on the arctic night. </p><p> As if suddenly revealed by a lightning</p><p>flash Jose and Blera glimpsed them right</p><p>ahead, the murderous hunt-pack from Tut- </p><p>chi’s Village sweeping the river-ice one hun- </p><p>dred strong with one lone cross-fox strain- </p><p>ing from their jaws. An instant they </p><p>glimpsed them, then in the belly of the bend, </p><p>fox, team, sled and hunt-pack collided in a </p><p>heap. </p><p> Cantine had loosened his grip on the sled</p><p>to grasp the rifle in defense, and the smash- </p><p>ing impact catapulted him clear into the </p><p>heart of the horde. </p><p> One moment Blera watched him sink in</p><p>a sea of bristling fur and slavering fangs be- </p><p>fore she beheld the same sea surging upon </p><p>her, the sea which was the concrete force </p><p>of the inimical wild, strong, sure, more ruth- </p><p>less even than the persecuting Bassett or </p><p>the avenging hand of Eric Sark. </p><p>TWO weeks later, Tom Bassett, re- </p><p>turning from Dawson City up the </p><p>Nordenskold River and swinging </p><p>through the night down the Klokhok River </p><p>to his partner’s cabin on the Nordenskold </p><p>Trail, drove over a rattling heap of debris </p><p>at the first bend above the Klokhok's </p><p>mouth. Curiously he swerved his sled back </p><p>to investigate, and one brief look before he </p><p>whipped on showed the remnants of a bro- </p><p>ken sled mingled with gnawed husky and </p><p>human bones glistening white under a rising </p><p>moon. </p><p> He whipped on fast and burst into the</p><p>cabin upon Sark who with a bandage over </p><p>a deep cut on his temple was forking bacon </p><p>from a frying-pan on the stove on to a plate. </p><p> “Eric,” Tom greeted with a tremor of re-</p><p>lief in his voice, “I struck somethin’ up- </p><p>river, and I wasn’t—well, sure, you know!” </p><p> “I’ve had visitors since you left,” replied</p><p>Sark grimly. </p><p> “Eh?” Bassett put out a sympathetic,</p><p>hand. “But Eric, you didn’t-” </p><p> “No,” returned his partner, gripping the</p><p>extended hand, “the hunt-pack saved me </p><p>the trouble. Sit in and have supper!” </p><p>FOREWORD </p><p>OUTH of the clustering .lEgean </p><p>Isles, half-way between Greece </p><p>and the rich Asiatic shore, the </p><p>island of Crete lies in the bosom </p><p>of the Mediterranean. Egypt is far to the </p><p>southeast of it, glorious in memories; and </p><p>still the huge temples of the Pharaohs lay </p><p>their mysterious enchantment on the minds </p><p>of men. </p><p> It was but yesterday that British genius</p><p>uncovered, in the land of Minos, the fossil </p><p>bones of an empire mighty as that of the </p><p>Osirian Kings, and richer than Nile-girdled </p><p>Thebes could boast. Unknown and un- </p><p>dreamed of till our own day, the enormous </p><p>foundations of Cretan Knossos speak of a </p><p>civilization of centuries, founded, not on </p><p>legions and on conquest, but on trade and </p><p>the might of invincible navies. Mycenas </p><p>was its colony, Troy its dependent. </p><p> Over the broken relics of its majesty,</p><p>tongues of fire have written a script which </p><p>we can read but imperfectly. Who burned </p><p>these royal cities, these kingly treasure- </p><p>houses? What daring conquerors crushed </p><p>the swarming fleets and descended with </p><p>tempestuous swiftness on the fair abodes? </p><p>No man knows; but this much is certain: </p><p> the destroyers were sea-farers, with ships</p><p> well-manned and numerous; for no danger</p><p> could threaten Crete until the galleys which</p><p> were her strength had been swept from the</p><p> Mediterranean.</p><p> Far away, in the north of Europe, mer-</p><p> chants of another race brought rich cargoes</p><p> into the ports of the North Sea and the</p><p> Baltic, and carried on their traffic overland</p><p> through Russia to Greece and the Eastern</p><p> world, centuries before the vikings made</p><p> their fierce raids on the southern coasts.</p><p> They, too, were skilled mariners and terrible</p><p> fighters, masters of the sea.</p><p> In these daring seamen of southern Scan-</p><p> dinavia, the authors have seen possible</p><p> rivals and enemies of Crete. The fleets of</p><p> Minos could not have endured the competi-</p><p> tion of other powerful traders; and the</p><p> Northmen were ever ready to fight for the</p><p> goodly markets of the world. It might even</p><p> be that these, the forefathers of the men of</p><p> Wisby, Throndheim, and Bergen, met and</p><p> received rebuffs from the Cretan lords of the</p><p> Mediterranean. It may be that the stout</p><p> ships of the North gathered, swept down on</p><p> the painted galleys of Minos, and emptied</p><p> their raging swordsmen on the Cretan coast.</p><p> 96</p><p>In the Grip of the Minotaur </p><p>97 </p><p> However this may be, somehow, at the</p><p>height of their beautiful, cruel culture, the </p><p>fair palaces of Knossos and Phasstos were </p><p>suddenly sacked and burned. With them, </p><p>the glory of the Mediterranean departed. </p><p>The strong hand of the Minoan king re- </p><p>laxed, the civilization of the south disinte- </p><p>grated; and for ages to come, darkness lay </p><p>over the lands until the light of Corinth, </p><p>Sparta, and Athens dispelled its barbaric </p><p>gloom. </p><p> But still the memory of this marvelous</p><p>land haunted the Mediterranean world. </p><p>Long after, the Grecian traveler Herodotus </p><p>learned from Egyptian priests of a myste- </p><p>rious kingdom in the sea, founded by the </p><p>gods, and destroyed by an unparalleled </p><p>catastrophe. </p><p> Magnified by repetition during the cen-</p><p>turies, the priestly tale told of a vast land, </p><p>peopled by a race supemally wise, and rich </p><p>beyond conception. Even to our own days </p><p>the legend has lingered, and men’s imagina- </p><p>tions still stir at the mention of the vanished </p><p>children of the gods, in the land of lost </p><p>Atlantis. </p><p>CHAPTER I </p><p>THE GRAY WOLF COMES </p><p>ROUND the sharp elbow of the little </p><p>bay shot a long, gray hull, urged by </p><p>the brisk wind in her swelling canvas and </p><p>the sturdy arms of forty rowers. As the </p><p>wolf’s head on her stem-post swung its </p><p>gaping, blood-red jaws round in a half- </p><p>circle, the single square sail spilled the wind, </p><p>flapped idly, and was quickly lowered and </p><p>stowed away, for the keelless northern </p><p>galley of 1400 b. c. could not tack. </p><p> The voice of the shore-watch rang out</p><p>sharply through his cupped hands, in the </p><p>hybrid patois of the Mediterranean traders. </p><p> “Who are ye who float hither with wolf-</p><p>painted sail and wolf on your prow? Whence </p><p>come ye? Is your errand peace or war?” </p><p>Two tall figures rose from the ship’s belly </p><p>and mounted the little half-deck forward, </p><p>where, steadying himself against the</p><p>shrouds, one roared reply: </p><p> “We are Northmen, come from afar. We</p><p>are no sea-thieves, but honest traders, </p><p>bringing amber from our own shores and tin </p><p>from the Isle of Mines to Troy town-fair. </p><p>He who stands by me is our master—Rag- </p><p>narr, son of Sigmund, King of the Island </p><p>Goths. If we are welcome, speak; if not, </p><p>we go hence as we came.” </p><p> As the shoreward wind bore the words to</p><p>him, the coast-guard raised a horn to his </p><p>lips and blew it twice. Out of the tower </p><p>behind him came a file of armed men who </p><p>ranged themselves in a close line along the </p><p>short beach. But, as the lashing oars </p><p>brought the galley closer in, the shore- </p><p>watch cried: </p><p> “Ye are welcome, and may the peace ye</p><p>bring be with you!” </p><p> The rowers drew in their dripping blades,</p><p>the heavy stone anchor rumbled over the </p><p>side and two boats were launched in quick </p><p>succession. Into the first clambered the </p><p>tall figures of captain and spokesman, fol- </p><p>lowed by six rowers; the second and.larger </p><p>boat was quickly filled with small bales </p><p>handed over the side, their bulk wrapped in </p><p>stout woolen cloth, bound with ropes of </p><p>bast. </p><p> When these were stowed, the boat was</p><p>manned by eight sailors, each detaching a </p><p>shield from the ship’s gunwale as he came, </p><p>and slinging it over his left shoulder by a </p><p>leathern thong. Shoving off swiftly, the </p><p>seamen propelled the boats shoreward till </p><p>they grounded, and the two leaders leaped </p><p>down to the beach. </p><p> The spokesman was a vast hulk of a man,</p><p>with a chest like a rampart, long, knotted </p><p>arms, and fierce, wise, old eyes. A bushy </p><p>red beard, slightly tinged with gray, hung </p><p>down in two forks over his breast. </p><p> He who was called Ragnarr was a hand-</p><p>breadth taller, but slenderer, with the agile </p><p>grace of youth. Like all his race, he was </p><p>fair and his blond hair streamed down over </p><p>his shoulders. Wide, piercing eyes gazed </p><p>from a well-tanned face; cheeks smooth, </p><p>save for a white scar reaching from nose to </p><p>chin, and only partly obscured by a long </p><p>yellow mustache. A great sword hung in a</p><p>gold-mounted scabbard of leather at his </p><p>side, and in his right hand he carried a long </p><p>bronze-headed spear. All the strangers </p><p>wore plain bronze helmets, coarse woolen </p><p>shirts and tunics, and strips of the same </p><p>material wound about their lower legs, down </p><p>to the soft-leather shoes. </p><p> But the shrewd-eyed coast-watch needed</p><p>no fine clothes to tell him who was in com- </p><p>mand and how to address him. </p><p>98 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Prince Ragnarr,” he said in deferential</p><p>tones, “all who come here with peaceful </p><p>thoughts are welcome, for our people are </p><p>eager for honest wares. But none may </p><p>enter the grounds of the fair till he has left </p><p>his weapons, either in his ship or at the </p><p>Temple of the Mother. I tell you this now, </p><p>that you may not unwittingly break the </p><p>laws of the land.” </p><p> “It is a good law,” answered Ragnarr,</p><p>“ and one that I know of old for it is ob- </p><p>served at fair-times in our land also. But </p><p>can our wares be boated up this river or must </p><p>my men carry them, for they are heavy?” </p><p>He pointed to the wide Scamander, </p><p>which, flowing down through the fertile </p><p>plain girding the new-built city of Troy, </p><p>entered the harbor not a hundred yards </p><p>from the wolf-ship’s mooring. </p><p> “The current is strong, but men like</p><p>yours should find it easy,” answered the </p><p>shore-watch, looking up with admiration at </p><p>the towering Northmen. “I am Kamas, </p><p>Captain of the Shore, and I will go with you </p><p>myself. Our king will wish to see such </p><p>heroes, for doubtless you have strange tales </p><p>to tell of the wide sea, and of the far-away </p><p>land whence you come.” </p><p> With an inclination of his head, Ragnarr</p><p>again entered his boat, followed by Valgard </p><p>and the Trojan, who delegated his charge </p><p>to a younger officer. Just before the skiff </p><p>was pushed off, one of the Northmen </p><p>stepped out quietly and walked along the </p><p>shore toward the ship, holding something </p><p>under his mantle. </p><p> Seated together in the boat, the Trojan</p><p>contrasted strangely enough with the blue- </p><p>eyed giants from the north. He was short, </p><p>dark, and clean-shaven like almost all his </p><p>race, wiry and athletic, with broad shoul- </p><p>ders and a slender waist, outlined by the </p><p>soft, girt-in tunic. His black hair curled </p><p>down below the edges of his red-plumed </p><p>helmet and his eyes were long, prominent </p><p>and heavily lashed. Unlike Ragnarr as he </p><p>was, he was even more unlike the massive </p><p>and ruddy Valgard, whose face was as </p><p>fierce and keen as that of the war-god of </p><p>his race. </p><p>THEY rowed on silently for a </p><p>space, till their boat, the foremost </p><p>of the two, rounded a curve of the </p><p>river, and the undergrowth which had lined </p><p>the bank was left behind. Then, as if a </p><p>curtain had been thrust aside, they saw a </p><p>fair, green plain, above which, reddened </p><p>with the last rays of the setting sun, the </p><p>great citadel of Troy rose from the massive </p><p>walls that crowned and girdled its sus- </p><p>taining hill. </p><p> The Northmen raised an astonished cry.</p><p>Ragnarr, turning to the captain, said in an </p><p>awe-struck voice: </p><p> “Cities have I seen, and strongholds, in</p><p>many lands, but never did I see or hear men </p><p>tell of such an abode as this. Your king </p><p>must be greater than all other earthly </p><p>rulers, for surely the home of the gods must </p><p>be like this city.” </p><p> Kamas smiled, but made no answer.</p><p>After his own first involuntary exclamation, </p><p>Valgard strove mightily to appear unim- </p><p>pressed. He was older than Ragnarr’s </p><p>father and had not traveled for nothing. </p><p> Now they came to a stone quay and</p><p>Kamas bade them disembark. </p><p> “Your goods will be safe enough here,” he</p><p>said, “for none but the king’s household </p><p>use this landing and it is well guarded.” </p><p> He spoke truly. No sooner had the first</p><p>sailors set foot on the stone steps than a file </p><p>of spearmen appeared and ordered them to </p><p>stand. But, at a sign from Kamas, their </p><p>officer bowed and led off his men as quickly </p><p>as they had come. </p><p> It was now dark, and as they took the</p><p>paved road leading up from the water, </p><p>lights flashed out in all parts of the city. </p><p>Outlined against the glow, a huge wall </p><p>loomed like a cliff before them. No cressets </p><p>flared on the parapet, no lighted loopholes </p><p>starred the black bulk of tower and curtain </p><p>and bastion. Nor was there the slightest </p><p>sign of gate or gateway when the Northmen </p><p>came, unchallenged, to the end of the paved </p><p>way; only the solid wall. </p><p> Then Kamas turned to the left and led</p><p>them along the foot of the wall, which,</p><p>after a score of paces, came to an end. A </p><p>turn to the right, four paces inward, a turn </p><p>to the right again, and the Northmen found </p><p>themselves following their guide down an </p><p>alley barely wide enough for two armed </p><p>men or a loaded pack-horse, with the wall on </p><p>either hand. </p><p> Suddenly the darkness before them</p><p>changed to a yellow glare of torchlight, out- </p><p>lining blackly the stout bars of a metal </p><p>grating barring the way. At the same time, </p><p>a stir and rustle above and to the right </p><p>drew Ragnarr’s dazzled eyes upward to the </p><p>platform of the outer wall. There the glint </p><p>In the Grip of the Minotaur </p><p>99 </p><p>of helmets and arrow-heads told how ready </p><p>were the Trojan archery to riddle the un- </p><p>shielded sides of the Northmen, packed </p><p>helpless in the brightly lit alley below. </p><p> “Well trapped!” growled Valgard appre-</p><p>ciatively, as he tried to shift his broad </p><p>shield to his right arm without letting go </p><p>of his long spear. </p><p> But Kamas spoke a word in the Trojan</p><p>tongue, the grating was swung wide by </p><p>unseen hands, and they passed round the </p><p>angle of the inner wall and entered the city. </p><p> To the left a broad street opened out</p><p>before them; to the right rose a tall, white </p><p>temple. </p><p> “Here you must leave your weapons,”</p><p>said Kamas, “for this is the Temple of the </p><p>Mother. I myself shall see to it that your </p><p>arms are safe, Prince Ragnarr, and in </p><p>particular that mighty sword, which must </p><p>be the gift of some god.” </p><p> But Ragnarr answered:</p><p> “Look more closely, friend Kamas, and</p><p>you will see that my scabbard is empty. </p><p>I do not doubt your good faith, but that </p><p>sword is indeed the gift of a god, who im- </p><p>posed on my race, his descendants, the </p><p>command that the blade should never </p><p>leave our kindred, even for a moment; </p><p>otherwise our house and people should </p><p>perish. I left it behind, therefore, with my </p><p>foster-brother, whom I ordered to quit the </p><p>last boat when you told us of your custom. </p><p>As we pulled up-stream, I saw my men row </p><p>out from the ship and take him back to it, </p><p>carrying the sword with him.” </p><p> “It is wise to obey the commands of the</p><p>gods,” said Kamas, “but you could have </p><p>trusted me, my prince.” </p><p> So saying, he led on through a narrow</p><p>thoroughfare past the face of the temple, </p><p>till they came to its entrance. A broad </p><p>stairway led up to a brilliantly lighted en- </p><p>trance, flanked by pikemen, drawn up on </p><p>either side of the stairs, and archers at the </p><p>top. </p><p> Through this doorway they passed into</p><p>a broad court, flagged with great close- </p><p>fitting slabs of polished stone. Iron rings, </p><p>set into some of these, hinted at trap-doors </p><p>leading to vaults below. </p><p> The temple, lighted so well without, was</p><p>dark within. A solitary torch gleamed at </p><p>the very back of the single court which </p><p>formed the interior and shone full on the </p><p>face of a great statue of bronze, repre- </p><p>senting a tall and majestic woman, clad in </p><p>sweeping robes but bare-bosomed. A </p><p>mitered crown adorned her head, and her </p><p>eyes were two great amethysts. </p><p> Kamas prostrated himself and the North-</p><p>men followed his example, Valgard mutter- </p><p>ing that it was well to placate the gods of a </p><p>country where one hoped to tarry safely, </p><p>but that he called his own gods to witness </p><p>that it was no derogation of their majesty. </p><p> Arising, Kamas pointed to the low and</p><p>broad stone altar before the goddess, its </p><p>outlines barely visible in the gloom, on </p><p>which lay many faintly glimmering objects. </p><p> “These are the arms of the common mer-</p><p>chants,” he said. “But yours shall be </p><p>better cared for.” </p><p> Stooping, he pressed one of the stones in</p><p>the side of the altar. It turned on its cen- </p><p>ter, revealing a cavernous opening. </p><p> “I pray you, let your men lay their</p><p>weapons here,” he said, and Ragnarr spoke </p><p>a few words of command in his native tongue. </p><p> Readily the sailors complied, after which</p><p>Kamas led them out through the great en- </p><p>trance and down the road back of the city </p><p>wall, to the broad street which led to the </p><p>citadel from the western gate. This street </p><p>was full of Trojans, taking the air and wait- </p><p>ing till their houses, heated like ovens by </p><p>the long day’s sun, became cool enough’ to </p><p>sleep in. Here, in the lower wards, fish were </p><p>being roasted over street-corner fires and </p><p>sold by the skewerful, while circles of </p><p>thirsty ones squatted round the tubs of </p><p>crude beer, which they were sucking through </p><p>straws to avoid the loose barley floating on </p><p>the surface. </p><p> Longingly looked the seamen at the food</p><p>and drink, and exchanged appreciative </p><p>glances with the dark-eyed women who </p><p>mingled freely with the crowd. But not a </p><p>man of Ragnarr’s crew lingered behind, for </p><p>they knew their captain. </p><p> “Here,” said Kamas, stopping before a</p><p>large dwelling that seemed dark and empty, </p><p>“is a guest-house where your men must </p><p>remain till morning, for at night no stran- </p><p>gers are permitted nearer the citadel.” </p><p> The place was a low, one-story stone</p><p>building, with a deeply recessed doorway. </p><p>Kamas took a torch from a niche in the </p><p>recess, lit it at the flare of the nearest door- </p><p>light, unlocked the wooden door of the </p><p>guest-house with a bronze key, and all </p><p>entered. Here was a single large room, </p><p>with a door in the rear leading to an ante- </p><p>chamber. </p><p>IOO </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Kindling the torches stuck in brackets</p><p>about the walls, Kamas pointed to the </p><p>numerous stools and mats ranged about the </p><p>floor and then stepped to a sunken closet </p><p>in the wall. Holding his torch before it, he </p><p>showed fruit, bread, and wine-jars to the </p><p>staring sailors, then turned toward the </p><p>door. </p><p> “If it please you, my prince,” he said to</p><p>Ragnarr, “it is time to wait on the king.” </p><p>Here Valgard interrupted: </p><p> “I have traveled far and wide, O Kamas,”</p><p>he said in angry tones, “but never yet have </p><p>I, the spokesman and kinsman of my </p><p>prince, been forbidden to go where he goes, </p><p>nor will I begin, at my age, to learn new </p><p>customs.” </p><p> But Ragnarr interposed:</p><p> “Strong men can break customs, but</p><p>only the weak break discipline. If you go </p><p>with me, who will keep these?” and he </p><p>pointed at his men who were wrenching the </p><p>plugs from the wine-jars, “from drowning </p><p>their sea-thirst with half the ale in Troy?” </p><p>“You speak wisdom where Kamas spake </p><p>folly,” answered Valgard, turning on his </p><p>heel. </p><p> “Take no notice of his bear’s manners,”</p><p>said Ragnarr to the captain, as they left </p><p>the house. “He growls at all times and is </p><p>silent only when he bites. He loves me </p><p>well and would keep by me at all times.” </p><p>They continued their way in the same </p><p>direction, following the street up a steep </p><p>slope, cut at intervals by broad concentric </p><p>avenues, dug out of the hill itself and faced </p><p>with polished stones. The spaces between </p><p>these avenues formed terraces covered with </p><p>buildings, the richer of stone, the poorer of </p><p>sun-baked brick. </p><p> At every street corner the two encoun-</p><p>tered the same dense crowd of people come </p><p>out to enjoy the cool night-air after the </p><p>stifling day. All who met the pair stared </p><p>open-mouthed at Ragnarr’s tall, barbaric </p><p>figure. </p><p> All at once, as they were elbowing their</p><p>way through the thronged intersection of</p><p>the street with one of the avenues, an ap- </p><p>proaching voice cried out in a high-pitched, </p><p>nasal chant. The crowds divided to right </p><p>and left, squeezing as close as they could to </p><p>the walls of the buildings on either side, and </p><p>all tongues were silent even in the midst of </p><p>speech. </p><p> Then was heard the sound of pattering</p><p>feet and round the curve of the avenue </p><p>came two half-naked runners, carrying </p><p>wands of office. They were followed by an </p><p>open litter, borne by four brawny blacks </p><p>clad in leopard-skin kirtles. </p><p> Like sheaves bending in the wind, the</p><p>long, dense lines of the multitude sank to </p><p>their knees in one motion, the rustle of </p><p>their garments drowning out the foot-beat </p><p>of the runners. Kamas knelt with the rest, </p><p>but Ragnarr, gazing at the litter in frank </p><p>curiosity, suddenly saw a vision that caused </p><p>him to stand as still as the heart in his own </p><p>breast. </p><p> The light from the torch on the house-</p><p>corner behind him fell full on the face of </p><p>the occupant of the passing litter, so that </p><p>it was outlined against the dark like a </p><p>cameo. It was the face of a young girl, her </p><p>profile clear, well-shaped and of exquisite </p><p>beauty. </p><p> For a moment Ragnarr stood immovable,</p><p>his eyes fastened on that face, till it grew </p><p>dim and faded out from the rays of light. </p><p>Then he became aware that all the people </p><p>had risen, and Kamas was plucking him by </p><p>the sleeve. He turned to follow, then </p><p>stopped again and asked his guide: </p><p> “Who is she who passed but now, whose</p><p>beauty made all the people bow before her? </p><p>Is she a goddess?” </p><p> Kamas looked up at him curiously and</p><p>answered with a shade of amusement in his </p><p>voice: </p><p> “It is Ilia, daughter of Dardanus our</p><p>king, and the people bowed before her </p><p>royalty.” </p><p> Ragnarr moved slowly forward, his eyes</p><p>rapt, his lips murmuring softly: “Ilia! </p><p>Ilia!” </p><p>CHAPTER II </p><p>ILIA </p><p>SOFT-FOOTED attendants bore away </p><p>the empty dishes, and, returning, filled </p><p>the slender cups with the amber wine of </p><p>Sidon. Then the white-haired king, his </p><p>shrew’d old face alight with interest, turned </p><p>to the grave-featured youth at his right </p><p>and said: </p><p> “It is indeed a wondrous tale, Prince</p><p>Ragnarr. I have seen men of your race </p><p>who had come by the overland road, show- </p><p>ing their wares at the market in Mycenae; </p><p>but their ships have never before ventured </p><p>the long voyage to our seas. And you say </p><p>In the Grip of the Minotaur </p><p>IOI </p><p>that your people have many such ships?” </p><p>“In our land, O king,” answered the </p><p>Northman, “every village furnishes a galley, </p><p>every district a host, to my father’s ven- </p><p>tures in peace and war. We could muster </p><p>two hundred ships on our island, and can </p><p>draw as many more at need from our allies </p><p>on the mainland.” </p><p> The king pondered this statement a mo-</p><p>ment, then turned again to his guest and </p><p>said, with a courteous gesture: “We have </p><p>wearied you with our curiosity. Let us </p><p>go, if you please, to my apartments.” </p><p> At once he rose and all at the table stood</p><p>up, bowed their heads, and remained stand- </p><p>ing till the king and the stranger he had </p><p>honored had passed from the columned </p><p>hall. At the door the two sentries drew </p><p>aside and raised their shields in salute. </p><p> The king preceded Ragnarr down a long</p><p>corridor to a curtained entrance, through </p><p>which they passed together. Ragnarr then </p><p>found himself in a stately chamber, paneled </p><p>and roofed with cedar, the ceiling being </p><p>supported by graceful shafts of the same </p><p>wood. Seating himself on a richly carved </p><p>armchair of Egyptian workmanship, the </p><p>king waved his guest to a divan opposite, </p><p>where the light of a perfumed torch fell </p><p>full on his face. </p><p> “I have dangerous neighbors,” King</p><p>Dardanus began, picking his words slowly. </p><p>“Certain matters make it inadvisable for </p><p>me to tell their names, but they have been </p><p>troublesome ever since it seemed good to </p><p>me that our power should expand. I built </p><p>new walls for my city, and they bribed the </p><p>contractors to furnish poor stone. I in- </p><p>creased the size of my armies, and they— </p><p>well, they interfered with my supply of </p><p>metal, for the mines are in their hands. </p><p>If I could find a strong, determined man, </p><p>with some force at his back, it might be </p><p>profitable to him.” </p><p> Here he paused and looked at Ragnarr</p><p>keenly. The young man was listening </p><p>with grave interest, but his features showed </p><p>nothing more. </p><p> “The man for my purpose must be a</p><p>merchant, with an eye for good weapons,” </p><p>continued Dardanus, speaking with slow </p><p>emphasis. “His ears must be open and </p><p>his lips shut; he must sail to and fro be- </p><p>tween here and—certain ports, with car- </p><p>goes of whatsoever I may specify, and must </p><p>carry large sums in gold and silver to pay </p><p>for the things which I require. Naturally, </p><p>he must be prepared both to resist pirates </p><p>and repel the curious.” </p><p> Still Ragnarr made no sign, and the king</p><p>spoke on: </p><p> “The rewards would be far greater than</p><p>the income of the richest trader, to com- </p><p>pensate for the lack of fame and safety in </p><p>the enterprise; for, of course, my name and </p><p>that of my city could not be brought into </p><p>the matter.” </p><p> As the-young man was still silent, the</p><p>king cleared his throat and began again: </p><p> “If you know such a man, I should be</p><p>most grateful if you would bring him to me, </p><p>especially if he were one of your race. You </p><p>are silent and strong, and such must my </p><p>servants be. In the meantime-” </p><p> He broke off and stared at the curtain.</p><p>Ragnarr’s eyes followed his gaze and saw a </p><p>dainty white hand on the fold. Next in- </p><p>stant the curtain was thrust aside, and a </p><p>lithe, supple form stood before them. It </p><p>was a girl of some seventeen or eighteen </p><p>years, her white garments clinging to her </p><p>shapely figure, her black hair streaming </p><p>down about her hips. </p><p> Her beautifully rounded arms were bare</p><p>to the elbow. Her complexion was much </p><p>lighter than that of most of her people; </p><p>the features small and daintily molded, </p><p>the chin rounded and dimpled, but firm </p><p>and strong. Her great brown eyes were </p><p>fringed with sweeping lashes, and the red </p><p>of her lips showed even in the half-light. </p><p>As her glance fell on Ragnarr she stopped, </p><p>eyes opened in surprise, and her face </p><p>flushed to the pink of a Persian rose. </p><p> “Forgive me, father,” she said in soft,</p><p>sweet tones. “I believed you were alone.” </p><p>But she made no move to go, and her </p><p>eyes were fixed on Ragnarr, who had risen</p><p>and stood riveted to the floor, staring in </p><p>mute astonishment; his breast heaved and </p><p>his face showed both admiration and won- </p><p>dering recognition. The king made a </p><p>gesture of resignation. </p><p> “Remain, my daughter,” he answered.</p><p>“This is my honored guest and, I hope, my </p><p>friend, Prince Ragnarr, heir to a great and </p><p>powerful kingdom in the distant north. </p><p>Lord Ragnarr, this heedless child is the </p><p>Princess Ilia, whom the gods gave me last </p><p>of all my children. It is a pretty lass, but </p><p>somewhat wilful.” </p><p> The princess advanced a step, her hand</p><p>held out in greeting. </p><p> “My father’s friends are ever welcome</p><p>102 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>to me,” she said. Ragnarr strode forward, </p><p>his face red with embarrassment, bent over </p><p>the small hand and kissed it, but found no </p><p>words. Neither seemed able to look away </p><p>from the other, the girl surveying his mighty </p><p>stature and clear, handsome features, the </p><p>man’s worshiping gaze fixed on the beauty </p><p>of her face. King Dardanus took in the </p><p>situation with shrewd, twinkling eyes. </p><p> Ilia turned to the king, still glancing</p><p>covertly at the Northman from the corners </p><p>of her long-fringed eyes. </p><p> “I shall wait on you in my mother’s</p><p>chamber, my father,” she said, and with </p><p>one swift last look at the stalwart North- </p><p>man, vanished behind the curtains. </p><p> Ragnarr drew a long breath, and swift</p><p>resolve was written on his face. </p><p> “One who seeks such a man as your</p><p>majesty has described,” he said, “would </p><p>find a faithful servant in me.” </p><p>CHAPTER III </p><p>TROY FAIR </p><p>“OIXES again! My luck holds, lads.” The </p><p> ^ dapper little gambler from Mycena;,</p><p>deftly palming the dice, substituted two </p><p>others, which he shoved over to one of </p><p>his opponents. These were raw-boned, </p><p>sheepskin-clad lumbermen from the Euxine </p><p>camps who had come to the Troad with </p><p>timber floated down the Straits. As their </p><p>speech showed, their race was closely akin </p><p>to that of Ragnarr and his Northmen. </p><p> One of the pair sullenly untwisted the</p><p>coil of silver from his upper arm and threw </p><p>it down in front of the Mycenaean. It </p><p>was clear that he had no more to lose. As </p><p>he rose, however, the wine-shop door burst </p><p>open and in stalked a long line of his fel- </p><p>lows, one after the other. </p><p> The foremost took in the situation at a</p><p>glance. </p><p> “Plucked, Bikki?” he roared out in a</p><p>voice already mellow. “Sit down again,</p><p>you oaf, and play till you strip him of silver, </p><p>earrings, and shirt.” </p><p> Bikki spread out his hands, indicating</p><p>the completeness of his defeat. </p><p> “But we have more, lad!” cried the new-</p><p>comer, clinking a sack of silver counters, </p><p>which, unalloyed and unstamped, formed </p><p>the ready money of the land. “He has </p><p>had all our skins from here to Cyprus, but </p><p>we have him now, and he shall pay.” </p><p> So saying, he dumped the contents of</p><p>the sack out on to the floor in front of Bikki, </p><p>then stepped behind him and leaned against </p><p>the wall. His fellows grouped themselves </p><p>around him and watched with intense </p><p>absorption. </p><p> Counter after counter found its way into</p><p>the pouch of the clever sharper, and anger </p><p>and discontent settled down on the lumber- </p><p>men’s faces. They were too wrapt up in </p><p>their own gloom to heed the lively passages </p><p>between the Syrian with the gaudy head- </p><p>band and the one-eyed Sicilian vender of </p><p>clay figures, who were indulging in satirical </p><p>personal comments intended for the ears </p><p>of the blowzy barmaid. She smiled at </p><p>each impartially, then turned to wink at a </p><p>tall sailor, who immediately ordered a </p><p>pitcher of the finest wine. </p><p> Suddenly an inarticulate roar arose from</p><p>a near-by bench, which encircled a large </p><p>beer-cask with its curving ends. </p><p> “You have said enough, you filthy, naked</p><p>swine!” cried a mighty-shouldered North- </p><p>man, thrusting one ham-like fist close to </p><p>the nose of a smiling Egyptian. “You </p><p>have heaped on me ill names, you have </p><p>called my people fleabitten barbarians, and </p><p>I answered you with pleasant jests. But </p><p>when you dare to revile my lord Ragnarr, </p><p>calling him timber for your beggarly Pha- </p><p>raoh’s footstool, you try a patient man too </p><p>far. What deeds has this Pharaoh done </p><p>that you rate him so highly?” </p><p> “You shall hear,” answered the Egyptian;</p><p>and drawing from its case a five-stringed </p><p>instrument of harp-like shape, he placed </p><p>its side against his olive-colored body, and </p><p>struck it resonantly. </p><p> “Hark to the deeds of the godlike Amen-</p><p>othes!” he sang. “Hark how he whelmed </p><p>the peoples in battle, how he ate up the </p><p>children of the distant lands!” </p><p> A wild, stirring chant it was, its minor</p><p>melody weaving in and out with varied </p><p>phrase, the strophes interspersed with the </p><p>repeated refrain— </p><p> “He smiteth them with his crescent ax,</p><p>his glittering, moon-shaped ax!” </p><p> With a swift blow the Northman dashed</p><p>the instrument from the singer’s hands, </p><p>the strings shattering with a vibrant wail. </p><p>“This is enough of axes!” he cried, his </p><p>eyes shining with the light of battle. “Be </p><p>silent, and hear a man sing of a sword!” </p><p>Swelling his deep chest, he opened his </p><p>mouth, and in a crashing voice that made </p><p>In the Grip of the Minotaur </p><p>the wine-cups rattle on their racks, he sang </p><p>the war-song of his house. </p><p> “The Song of the Sword!</p><p> Tyr!</p><p> The swift, surging death-flare,</p><p> The bright flame of battle!</p><p> The War-God hath forged it</p><p> Ages uncounted</p><p> Ere earth was shapen;</p><p> Hammered and hardened it,</p><p> In its hot metal</p><p> Bound the strife-demon,</p><p> Breathed his grim anger.</p><p> With cunning he shaped it,</p><p> With curses envenomed;</p><p> Whoso shall wield it</p><p> Ne’er shall be conquered;</p><p> Death shall go with him,</p><p> Follow him, drive him</p><p> To riches and conquest,</p><p> To glory and ruin.</p><p> Ne’er shall he fall</p><p> Till fate shall beguile him;</p><p> Then the wild demon,</p><p> Walled in its edges,</p><p> Shall wrench from his hand-clasp</p><p> And rend him asunder!</p><p> “Tyr!</p><p> The Smith Immortal</p><p> The gray sword hath given</p><p> In the fulness of time</p><p> To his son, the first Tyrfing.</p><p> Far o’er all earth-realms</p><p> His fame spread, unbounded:</p><p> The Sword in his strong hand</p><p> Swept all folk before him;</p><p> Till, heaped with honors,</p><p> In the height of his glory,</p><p> It wrenched from his hand</p><p> And rent him asunder! '</p><p> “Tyr!</p><p> From father to son</p><p> It hath passed, as Fate doomed it,</p><p> And shall, till the anger</p><p> Of Tyr be averted.</p><p> Now a hero holds it</p><p> Hardiest of earth-folk,</p><p> Brave in adventuring,</p><p> Matchless in battle;</p><p> Ne’er shall he falter,</p><p> Nor fail of conquest;</p><p> While blade cleaves to handle,</p><p> While blood dyes the edges,</p><p> While gray sword slayeth,</p><p> And gray wolf devoureth,</p><p> His fame shall soar upward</p><p> As soars the swift eagle,</p><p> And shelter the peoples</p><p> ’Neath the shade of his pinions.</p><p> “This is the Sword-Song,</p><p> The Song of our People,</p><p> The Song of the Gray Sword;</p><p> The Song he hath taught us—</p><p> Tyr!”</p><p>The harsh northern words meant noth- </p><p>ing to many of his listeners, but a shout</p><p>103 </p><p>went up from the lumbermen. Bikki, his </p><p>throw made, raised shining eyes to the </p><p>bard and followed the final words of the </p><p>song with a “Tyr!” that made the rafters </p><p>ring. Then, looking down, he echoed this </p><p>with a cry of anger and, seizing the My- </p><p>cenaean by the hand, pressed the knuckles </p><p>with his broad thumb, till the gambler’s </p><p>lips were compressed with pain, his fingers </p><p>unclinched and a second pair of dice clat- </p><p>tered on to the table. Still holding his </p><p>man’s hand in a grip like the pinch of a </p><p>half-split log, Bikki whipped out his knife </p><p>and cut through a die near the top, reveal- </p><p>ing a little disk of lead. </p><p> A savage, prolonged hiss shot from the</p><p>lumbermen’s lips, and they crowded about </p><p>the two, muttering ominously. Three vil- </p><p>lainous-looking fellows stole out of the </p><p>darkest corner, drawing crooked knives </p><p>from their garments. </p><p> As the tavern-keeper rushed up and flung</p><p>his arms around Bikki’s neck, the foremost </p><p>of the three slipped behind Bikki with </p><p>ready blade; but a red-haired lumberman </p><p>seized the ruffian’s arm and flung him to </p><p>the pavement. In the confusion that fol- </p><p>lowed, the gambler freed himself and crept </p><p>snake-like toward the door. </p><p> Bikki wrenched himself free from the</p><p>encircling arms of the landlord and rushed </p><p>after the Mycentean, only to trip over a </p><p>stool and knock himself senseless against </p><p>the raised stone threshold, across which </p><p>his adversary had just disappeared. The </p><p>other lumbermen looked at each other in </p><p>bewildered amazement, their slow-working </p><p>brains befuddled with wine and dazed by </p><p>the swiftness of events. </p><p> At that moment the excited bard, still</p><p>tingling with the cadences of his barbaric </p><p>song, flung back his head and chanted the </p><p>last strophe once more, and the lumbermen </p><p>swayed their bodies in drunken abandon </p><p>to the rhythm. As the word “Tyr!” burst </p><p>from the singer’s lips, a frenzied light kin- </p><p>dled in their eyes. With a loud shout of </p><p>“Tyr! Tyr! Kill! Kill!” they burst through </p><p>the tavern door and swept down the main </p><p>street of the fair-grounds, leaving behind </p><p>them a broad trail of overturned booths,</p><p>torn fabrics, smashed pottery, spilled sweet- </p><p>meats and rolling fruit. </p><p> Before them bolted shopkeepers and</p><p>customers on panic-winged feet. Tearing </p><p>down the sail-cloths that sheltered the </p><p>booths from the sun, pulling up the long </p><p>104 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>wooden tent-pins and aiming blows with </p><p>them at everything breakable, human or </p><p>otherwise, that came within arm-sweep, </p><p>the frenzied lumberjacks cleared the street. </p><p>Soon not a single figure could be seen for </p><p>rods in front of them, while behind them </p><p>stretched a broad avenue of desolation. </p><p>Roaring their fierce chant of “Tyr! Tyr! </p><p>Kill! Kill!” they bore down on the crowded </p><p>center of the fair-grounds. </p><p>GROANS, hisses, and catcalls rose </p><p>from the tight-packed crowd in </p><p>front of the wooden scaffold. The </p><p>discomfited jugglers hastily retired into the </p><p>cloth shelter at the back, fearing more </p><p>tangible evidence of the disapproval of </p><p>their audience. At last an articulate voice </p><p>rang out above the general tumult, and the </p><p>entire multitude took up the cry in eager, </p><p>insistent unison: </p><p> “Rala! Give us Rala! We want Rala!</p><p>Rala! Rala!” </p><p> For several minutes the clamor swelled;</p><p>then came a gaping, expectant silence. </p><p>The curtain of the tent had stirred. Now </p><p>a wild, prolonged cheer went up, as the </p><p>lissom figure of a girl bounded to the very </p><p>edge of the platform and stood there, bow- </p><p>ing and throwing kisses. She was small, </p><p>almost to tininess, and her supple, pliant </p><p>form was perfectly revealed by her pro- </p><p>fessional costume—a narrow cloth about </p><p>the loins and a tight cap enclosing the </p><p>hair. </p><p> When the tumult had died down an</p><p>assistant came out, carrying a long sword. </p><p>From his sleeve he drew a feather, tossed </p><p>it into the air, and held the blade beneath </p><p>it. The plume floated down across the </p><p>edge, and without a perceptible check con- </p><p>tinued its fluttering course in two pieces. </p><p>Then he raised the sword, swung it round </p><p>his head twice and made a lightning-like </p><p>stroke at Rala. The crowd shuddered, </p><p>but Rala, poised on tiptoe, lightly turned </p><p>a complete back-somersault, landing up- </p><p>right at the extreme back of the stage. A </p><p>sigh of relief escaped from the audience, </p><p>followed by a crash of applause. </p><p> Now a second man emerged from the</p><p>tent, his well-muscled body rippling with </p><p>every movement. He advanced to the </p><p>front and stood still, feet together and arms </p><p>out horizontally from his sides. Rala, </p><p>with a single bound, landed on his shoul- </p><p>ders, stood there balancing a moment, and </p><p>stooped till her hands rested in front of her </p><p>feet. Then, slowly and carefully, her head </p><p>resting on his, she swung her feet backward </p><p>and upward till they pointed skyward. </p><p>Her arms moved down and out at her sides, </p><p>paralleling those of her partner; and her </p><p>legs bowed out from her jointed feet till </p><p>they formed an ellipse. Man and woman </p><p>together formed a complete and nearly </p><p>perfect crux ansata. </p><p> On her feet once more, Rala began an</p><p>intricate and dangerous sword-dance, tread- </p><p>ing the measures with her hands, her body </p><p>poised in the air above the dangerous </p><p>blades. Suddenly there was a craning of </p><p>necks, cries of alarm were heard, and the </p><p>crowd began to melt. In a few minutes it </p><p>was quite dispersed, men, women and chil- </p><p>dren fleeing in a dozen directions. </p><p> Her two assistants scrambled down to</p><p>investigate, then ran away swiftly, think- </p><p>ing only of themselves. Still Rala danced </p><p>on. Absorbed in the joy of the skilled </p><p>artist, she had not once looked at the au- </p><p>dience, had interpreted their cries of alarm </p><p>as expressions of fear for the dangers of </p><p>her performance, and was quite unaware </p><p>that she was alone. One, two more mo- </p><p>tions of the deft hands, and she hurled her </p><p>body over the blades, lighting squarely on </p><p>her feet in front of—emptiness. </p><p> There she stood, arms wide for her bow,</p><p>and noticed for the first time that her au- </p><p>dience had disappeared. A cry of bitter </p><p>disappointment burst from her; she stood </p><p>looking out over the desolate place with </p><p>eyes in which tears of anger and mortifica- </p><p>tion burned. Then, and not till then, her </p><p>ears caught the sound of many feet and of </p><p>rough, threatening voices. </p><p> Fear came into her eyes. She leaped</p><p>down to the street and fell, rose, staggered </p><p>and fell again with a sob of agony, as an </p><p>intolerable pain shot through her ankle. </p><p>Vainly she strove to rise, the shouts of the </p><p>approaching mob ringing in her ears. </p><p> Then they burst upon her, a surging line</p><p>of sheepskin-clad giants armed with long </p><p>tent - pins. The foremost lumberman, </p><p>whooping with triumph, stooped, passed </p><p>an arm round her struggling body and </p><p>lifted her to his breast. </p><p> Her lithe limbs writhed and the muscles</p><p>stood out on her well-trained arms like </p><p>lashing cords. In vain. The mighty clasp </p><p>of the savage that held her did not weaken. </p><p>In desperation she sank her teeth into his </p><p>In the Grip of the Minotaur </p><p>105 </p><p>bare neck. With a harsh oath he dropped </p><p>her and clapped his hand to the wound. </p><p> As she fell, another lunged at her and</p><p>swung her to him. She struck him in the </p><p>face with her clinched fists; then blackness </p><p>closed in upon her. </p><p>RAGNARR stood in front of his </p><p>booth, the covering of which was the </p><p>wolf-painted sail of his galley. On </p><p>either hand, the wrappings of the now- </p><p>opened bales were stretched over oars to </p><p>make two more tents, in one of which his </p><p>men displayed pieces of red, white, or golden </p><p>amber, in the other, ingots of pure tin. </p><p> The Trojan officer of police beside him</p><p>had just said something highly amusing, </p><p>at which the young Northman threw back </p><p>his head with a shout of laughter. Sud- </p><p>denly he started and listened with straining </p><p>ears, his hand clutching the officer’s arm. </p><p> “It is trouble of some sort,” he said.</p><p>“There are many of them, by the voices. </p><p>You will need men at your back.” </p><p> The officer, whose city-bred ears were</p><p>less keen, stood listening for a moment, </p><p>then exclaimed— </p><p> “You are right! I go.”</p><p> And go he did, at a swift pace.</p><p> Out of the tent came the grim figure of</p><p>Valgard. </p><p> “Well, master!” he exclaimed. “The</p><p>wind brings the sound of battle, and where </p><p>there is fighting the wolves must follow.” </p><p>“Here come sheep,” answered Ragnarr </p><p>contemptuously, as a knot of traders and </p><p>mountebanks came rushing round the cor- </p><p>ner, their faces sallow with fright. </p><p> “Run for your lives!” gasped a fat Tyrian</p><p>as he panted past. “Ten shipfuls of Euxine </p><p>pirates are harrying the fair!” </p><p> “I hear no clatter of sword on shield,”</p><p>said Ragnarr calmly. “It is no battle, but </p><p>a fair-time brawl. Still, do you, Tyrleif, </p><p>keep the men together and guard the booths</p><p>while Valgard and I go to look at these </p><p>peace-breakers.” </p><p> Swiftly the two Northmen strode to the</p><p>street-corner, round which poured an ever- </p><p>thickening stream of fugitives who swerved </p><p>to right and left to let them pass. They </p><p>turned the corner and saw dust rising and </p><p>tents going down some fifty paces up the </p><p>main street before the onrush of a mob of </p><p>skin-clad men, waving long clubs. </p><p> “Wait, master,” said Valgard. “We</p><p>can not meet those lads unarmed.” </p><p> “See what that tall fellow is carrying,”</p><p>answered Ragnarr. “Hasten!” </p><p> Up the street he dashed, and Valgard,</p><p>willy-nilly, after him. The advancing mob </p><p>saw two unarmed men speeding toward </p><p>them, hesitated and stopped in surprise. </p><p>Ragnarr strode straight to the man who </p><p>carried Rala, seized him by the arm and </p><p>roughly commanded him to put her down. </p><p>The lumberman stared at him stupidly for </p><p>a moment, then, realizing the import of his </p><p>words, cursed him violently and tried to pass. </p><p> With one upward swing of his fist, Rag-</p><p>narr sent the giant spinning, and wrenched </p><p>Rala from his relaxing grasp. Swinging </p><p>her to his shoulder, he started to give back; </p><p>but with shouts of rage the mob pressed in </p><p>upon him, shouting: “Kill! Kill!” </p><p> Ragnarr had but one arm free to defend</p><p>himself and his burden, and it would have </p><p>gone hard with him but for Valgard. To </p><p>right and left shot the veteran’s great knot- </p><p>ted fists, and two men fell as if poleaxed. </p><p> Seizing a stake from the hand of one of</p><p>them, Valgard placed himself beside his </p><p>master and struck out with fury. His </p><p>terrific blows never missed, and those in </p><p>front began to give way. But the two </p><p>Northmen were outflanked, and a club </p><p>came down from the left, striking for Rag- </p><p>narr’s head. He threw up his free hand </p><p>to ward off the blow, which fell on his heavy </p><p>spiral armlet, shattering it to pieces. But </p><p>it had checked the force of the blow, or his </p><p>arm had been broken. </p><p> Hitting his man under the chin with all</p><p>the strength of his arm, Ragnarr gave back </p><p>as fast as he could. He stumbled, turned,</p><p>and felt his back fetch up against some- </p><p>thing solid. It was the scaffolding of Rala’s </p><p>platform. Now he was safe on one side </p><p>at least. </p><p> Valgard pressed close to him, striking</p><p>rapidly and coolly. Some one in the rear </p><p>threw a stake, which thudded against the </p><p>wood beside Ragnarr’s head. </p><p> “They have us now,” said Valgard</p><p>through his clinched teeth. </p><p> Above the tumult sang a strident sound,</p><p>half hum and half hiss, and one of the lum- </p><p>bermen pitched forward, arms outstretched, </p><p>with an arrow between his shoulder-blades. </p><p>The sound came again, more loudly, and </p><p>three others fell. Then, with a shout, a </p><p>detachment of the soldiery who policed the </p><p>fair charged in with drawn swords. Cries </p><p>of pain mingled with yells of fury. </p><p>io6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> The mob made a short stand, then turned</p><p>and fled in panic, but many were overtaken </p><p>in mid-flight by the swift arrows. In five </p><p>minutes the place was clear, save for the </p><p>dead and dying who were picked up and </p><p>carried off by the soldiers. </p><p> “Are you unhurt, my lord?” asked the</p><p>officer—the same with whom Ragnarr had </p><p>been talking when he first heard the uproar. </p><p> “I am well, but this maid seems some-</p><p>what injured,” answered Ragnarr, bending </p><p>solicitously over Rala. </p><p> “It is nothing but a contortionist,” said</p><p>the officer, “who makes sport for the rabble </p><p>on street-corners. It is not possible that </p><p>my lord risked his life for such as she?” </p><p>“Sir,” replied Ragnarr, his cheeks flushed </p><p>with anger, “in my land a woman is a wo- </p><p>man, and men are willing to die for her, </p><p>whether she be a peasant’s girl or a king’s </p><p>daughter. You have done your work well, </p><p>and I shall mention it to your royal master. </p><p>Now leave us, for we have work to do.” </p><p> He carried the girl to his booth, laid her</p><p>under the shade of the sail and bathed her </p><p>temples and her swollen ankle with wine. </p><p>Her eyes opened. She looked up at him </p><p>with tears streaming down her cheeks. </p><p> “I had fainted,” she said, “but when I</p><p>awoke you were holding me in your arms, </p><p>and fighting. I heard what the soldier </p><p>said, and it is true. You should not have </p><p>risked your life for me; but it was noble, </p><p>and I thank you—I thank you.” </p><p> “Hush, child,” answered Ragnarr. “You</p><p>are hurt and overwrought, and must not </p><p>talk till you are stronger.” </p><p> He drew his gray mantle over her, for</p><p>the evening breeze had sprung up and it </p><p>was cold. </p><p> “I have poor quarters to offer you, but</p><p>here you must stay till your ankle is well </p><p>again and you can walk.” </p><p> “Lord,” she replied with a sob, “you</p><p>have done me the first kindness I have ever </p><p>known, and I shall never leave you while</p><p>Hive.” . </p><p>CHAPTER IV </p><p>THE COMPACT </p><p>“ ARE you sure he is safe? He was not </p><p> hurt?”</p><p> “Quite sure, Princess. A little thing</p><p>she was, and no great burden for him.” </p><p>“And is she beautiful?” </p><p> “As women of her sort are beautiful.</p><p>Her face seemed a good one, though she </p><p>was not clothed as a modest girl should be.” </p><p>The two women stood in the Northeast </p><p>Tower of the Citadel overlooking the little </p><p>plain between the rolling Simois and the </p><p>Scamander. The sun was not yet high </p><p>enough to drive them to seek shelter from </p><p>its heat, and it was pleasant to look out </p><p>over the lovely valley and the low hills </p><p>beyond to where the Straits broadened out </p><p>into the blue .^gean. Ilia stood silent for </p><p>a moment, wrapped in anxious thought. </p><p> “I must see him,” she said slowly. “Has</p><p>he reported the matter to the king?” </p><p> “Not yet,” answered the attendant,</p><p>“but I heard Acharsis, the captain of Ar- </p><p>chers, say that the Northman had been </p><p>sent for and would come before noon to- </p><p>day.” </p><p> “Then he should be here within two</p><p>hours,” the princess said meditatively. </p><p>“Do you go and watch for him, and send </p><p>him to me before he goes to the king.” </p><p> The maid bowed and descended the</p><p>stone stairs. </p><p> Ilia leaned against the parapet, her chin</p><p>resting in her cupped hands. She no longer </p><p>saw the turbulent little river girdling the </p><p>green bosom of the plain, nor felt the sea- </p><p>wind that blew a loose strand of her dark </p><p>hair across her cheek. She was thinking </p><p>of the stately Northman, whose stern, fair </p><p>young face had mingled itself with her </p><p>waking thoughts and thrust itself into her </p><p>dreams from that first moment when she </p><p>had pushed aside the curtains of her fa- </p><p>ther’s chamber and seen him standing be- </p><p>fore her. </p><p> Why did she think of him so much? He</p><p>was a stranger of uncommon stature and </p><p>striking appearance, a figure one could </p><p>hardly forget so soon. But that was not </p><p>all. When her waiting-maid told her of </p><p>the wild street-fight in which Ragnarr had </p><p>stood in peril of Ms life, her heart had beat- </p><p>en tumultuously, as if something deep </p><p>within her had been intimately bound up </p><p>with his safety. </p><p> But what was he to her? Why should</p><p>she care whether he lived or died? One </p><p>life more or less mattered little in the cruel </p><p>world in which she moved. In spite of </p><p>herself, however, she had been deeply dis- </p><p>turbed. And when she heard how Ragnarr </p><p>had carried that woman of the corner shows </p><p>in his arms, her head on his shoulder, and </p><p>In the Grip of the Minotaur </p><p>107 </p><p>borne her to his own lodging, a sharp pang </p><p>shot through her, and the beautiful day lost </p><p>something of its brightness. </p><p> It was maddening merely to think that</p><p>she, a princess of the blood of Teucer, </p><p>should resent a kindness shown by a wan- </p><p>dering stranger to a wretched little acrobat. </p><p>Was she bewitched? Had this Northman, </p><p>with his strange gods, cast a spell over her? </p><p> So absorbed was she in her disturbed</p><p>fancies that she did not hear the soft scrape </p><p>of leather-shod feet on the stairs, did not </p><p>feel the presence behind her. A low, grave </p><p>voice broke in upon her reverie— </p><p> “You sent for me, lady?”</p><p> She turned swiftly, the color mounting</p><p>her cheeks to the very eyes. Yes, it was </p><p>he. She was conscious of a strange thrill, </p><p>half gladness and half fear, which she strove </p><p>in vain to suppress. With an effort, she </p><p>mastered herself. </p><p> “Yes,” she replied. “I have been told</p><p>that yesterday at the fair you did a deed of </p><p>which I would hear from your own lips. </p><p>You braved peril of death for a woman </p><p>who was nothing to you. Such a sacrifice </p><p>for one dearly loved—that I can under- </p><p>stand; but I know no man in Troy who </p><p>would risk a finger for a street-girl’s life.” </p><p>Her clear eyes searched his face. </p><p> “It was little enough for a man to do,</p><p>lady,” he replied, for the moment shy and </p><p>embarrassed. “I have staked life and </p><p>limb often for fame, even for riches; and is </p><p>not a human life of much more worth than </p><p>these?” </p><p> “I have often thought so,” she answered,</p><p>her admiration showing in spite of herself. </p><p>“But I have heard no other say it till now. </p><p>You are indeed a stranger among us, Prince </p><p>Ragnarr. In this land into which you have </p><p>come, every effort is strained to keep the </p><p>breath in one’s own poor body, and to win </p><p>favors from the great. Some time I should </p><p>like to know more of your land, and of your </p><p>gods who give you such good and gentle </p><p>thoughts. But tell me what you intend </p><p>to do with this girl, since you can not keep</p><p>her in a company of men.” </p><p> Ragnarr frowned.</p><p> “I do not know,” he said. “She is a</p><p>good child and puts herself out to be use- </p><p>ful, but I confess that I am troubled con- </p><p>cerning her. My men cast their eyes upon </p><p>her, and I fear for her safety. Besides, she </p><p>keeps about me whenever she can, so that </p><p>I scarcely have a moment for myself. If </p><p>she had any one to care”for her, I would have </p><p>sent her to them before this; but she is </p><p>friendless, and, moreover, she refuses to </p><p>leave me.” </p><p> Ilia laughed musically, a happy laugh.</p><p>The sense of oppression rolled from her. </p><p>If this girl were anything to the man who </p><p>had saved her life, he could not have spoken </p><p>of her as he did, nor thought of sending </p><p>her away. She regarded him a moment </p><p>with softly sparkling eyes and then laid </p><p>her hand on his arm. </p><p> “You can find a way out of your own</p><p>difficulty and serve me at the same time,” </p><p>she said gently. “I am in need of a com- </p><p>panion who will speak to me of real things, </p><p>who will tell me how my people five—their </p><p>joys and sufferings, their hopes and fears. </p><p>None are permitted to tell such things to </p><p>me. I hear only what is agreeable, yet I </p><p>know there are those in the world who are </p><p>harassed, for I have passed through the </p><p>city and seen faces on which sorrow had </p><p>set its seal. This girl must have known </p><p>such things, and she can help me to learn </p><p>the needs of the people. Give her to me, </p><p>and I will see that she lacks nothing. Will </p><p>you do this for me?” </p><p> “Lady,” answered Ragnarr, his voice</p><p>strangely stirred, “I will do this, or any- </p><p>thing, for you.” </p><p> “Send her to me in two days, then,” said</p><p>Ilia, “for on the day after tomorrow, one </p><p>of my waiting-women goes to her father’s </p><p>house. Now tell me, you who are so brave </p><p>and yet so gentle, what have you to do </p><p>with the dark plans of my father, who </p><p>never gives his friendship save to those </p><p>whom he means to use? I have not seen </p><p>you more than a few times, but I know </p><p>that you are of a metal too fine for his </p><p>shaping.”</p><p> “He has confided but little in me as yet,</p><p>but I gather that there are matters of </p><p>trading and fighting to be done, and these </p><p>are my profession.” </p><p> “But are you satisfied to imperil your-</p><p>self, and the men who trust you, in an- </p><p>other’s quarrel? He must have offered </p><p>you much gold.” </p><p> “You do me wrong, lady,” answered</p><p>Ragnarr vehemently. “I am a king’s son </p><p>and take no service under any man for </p><p>gold. My sword is my own, and I do not </p><p>sell it.” </p><p> “Ah,” she said, with a little sigh of re-</p><p>lief. “Then there is some weightier reason?” </p><p>io8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Yes, a reason that in my eyes outweighs</p><p>life itself, gold and kingdoms.” </p><p>“And you can not tell me what it is?” </p><p>Again her white hand rested lightly on </p><p>his arm; her lips smiled. Her unconscious- </p><p>ly intimate, gently pleading manner, over- </p><p>whelmed him. </p><p> “Not now, lady, not now,” he stam-</p><p>mered. “But, by my gods, I shall tell you </p><p>some time, if I live!” </p><p> She felt his arm tremble under her hand</p><p>and drew back in a soft palpitation of </p><p>ffight which she did not understand. </p><p> A dry chuckle sounded behind them.</p><p>Ragnarr turned around sharply, his hand </p><p>instinctively at his empty scabbard: Then </p><p>the fire died out of his eyes and confusion </p><p>fell upon him. Ilia’s head was bowed, her </p><p>cheeks scarlet. </p><p> “Well, children,” wheezed old Dardanus,</p><p>“your talk must have been interesting to </p><p>make you so blind and deaf. I have been </p><p>standing here as long as a man might count </p><p>six score, and I might have been a brick in </p><p>this wall for all the respect you paid me. </p><p>But now run to your mother, girl. The </p><p>sun here is too hot for your dainty cheeks, </p><p>though it can harm this weather-beaten </p><p>Northman little.” </p><p> With a dutiful bow, not unmixed with</p><p>trepidation, Ilia swept down the stair, her </p><p>fine head tilted a little proudly. </p><p> “Now, my young friend,” said the old</p><p>king, swiftly changing to a confidential </p><p>manner, “it is time, is it not, I told you </p><p>more of my purposes? But first, you have </p><p>entered my service of your own free will, </p><p>and of your own free will you may draw </p><p>out again, if the thought of danger disturbs </p><p>you aught.” </p><p> “My lord,” answered Ragnarr haughtily,</p><p>“a hero is my father, and my mother was </p><p>as familiar with the spear as with the dis- </p><p>taff. I took my first pap on the point of-a. </p><p>sword, and drank my first wine out of a </p><p>skull. If you desire to lose my services, </p><p>speak of danger to me but once more.”</p><p>“Nay, nay, be not so hot with me,” </p><p>broke in the king. “If you love danger so, </p><p>I can make her your constant companion, </p><p>your bride. But this is the whole matter, </p><p>and you may take it or leave it. As you </p><p>know, Troy depends for its very life on the </p><p>trade which is floated hither from all di- </p><p>rections. From the northeast, timber is </p><p>rafted down from the Euxine; slaves are </p><p>borne to us from the south, amber from </p><p>your own land, and tin from the Isle of </p><p>Mines in the northern seas, while copper </p><p>is carried—when it comes at all—from the </p><p>island of Crete. </p><p> “Now follow me closely. Crete is the</p><p>seat of a mighty empire which could crush </p><p>me as a cat crushes a bird. I have a strong </p><p>city and brave men, but of what avail is </p><p>courage without weapons? I can not make </p><p>swords and spears without bronze; I can </p><p>not make bronze without copper and tin. </p><p>Minos, King of Crete, levies a crushing </p><p>tribute on me, and if I withhold it he keeps </p><p>copper from me and forbids the Myceneeans </p><p>to send me the tin which enters their waters. </p><p>I have no ships of my own, and Minos’s </p><p>countless sails dot the wide waters of the </p><p>Mediterranean. If after a time I am still </p><p>defiant, he blockades my ports, and shuts </p><p>out all things which come by sea. Then </p><p>my trade dies and my people grow poor. </p><p> “If I had sufficient store of weapons for</p><p>a long war, I could spit at him. Now, you </p><p>are a daring seaman and have your own </p><p>ship. I can not obtain the raw metal for </p><p>my needs, but with your aid I can import </p><p>weapons ready-made from Egypt, whose </p><p>Pharaoh controls the copper-mines of Sinai. </p><p>If I traded with him direct, Minos of Crete </p><p>would know it, and, being mightier than I, </p><p>could persuade Egypt to refuse to trade </p><p>with me. But you are unknown in these </p><p>southern lands. I will send you with se- </p><p>cret letters to the Pharaoh Amenothes, </p><p>and you shall contract to carry gold and </p><p>silver to him, ostensibly for spice and ala- </p><p>baster, and bring back swords, spear-heads, </p><p>and arrow-points of bronze.” </p><p> “And then,” interrupted Ragnarr, stirred</p><p>to enthusiasm, “we can store food and </p><p>water in the vaults of temples and palaces, </p><p>shut ourselves within the walls, and defy </p><p>this island tyrant!” </p><p> “Not so rash! Not so rash!” admonished</p><p>Dardanus. “A war is not won so. We </p><p>might hold out a year, perhaps, but his </p><p>ships would shut us off from the world, </p><p>destroy our trade, cut off help from without </p><p>—even sail up the Scamander. And his </p><p>sea-thieves, disembarking, would pillage </p><p>our lands and reap our harvests. The </p><p>bravest heart can not fight an empty stom- </p><p>ach. And as long as Minos held the sea, </p><p>we could wage only a defensive war, and </p><p>his gold would attract great hordes of mer- </p><p>cenaries from Egypt, Mycenas, and the </p><p>East. No, there is something more. We </p><p>In the Grip of the Minotaur </p><p>109 </p><p>must beat down his shield before we can </p><p>pierce, his heart. We must destroy his </p><p>fleet!” </p><p> lie said this with a concentrated hatred,</p><p>a fury, which transformed his cunning old </p><p>face into a fiendish mask. </p><p> “How can you do this with no ships?”</p><p>asked Ragnarr doubtfully. </p><p> “That is just the point, my good youth.</p><p>That is your second task. First you set </p><p>our craftsmen to work, till they have built </p><p>a small trading fleet. Then you bring in </p><p>many shiploads of arms from Egypt, till </p><p>we have enough. Then you shall go back </p><p>to your own people and induce them to </p><p>send great merchant-fleets, to cripple this </p><p>Cretan devil’s commerce. Then he will </p><p>swell with anger and think of war. But </p><p>by that time, what with the ships of your </p><p>people and those you shall teach us to build, </p><p>we shall have a fleet which can break his </p><p>navies and scatter his people to the four </p><p>winds!” </p><p> Dardanus rubbed his withered old hands</p><p>and chuckled in gleeful anticipation. But </p><p>Ragnarr answered: </p><p> “There is one thing more, O king. What</p><p>is my reward to be, if I accomplish all this? </p><p>For it will be a long, hard task. My men </p><p>are dear to me, and their lives are worth </p><p>more than the gold and silver you spoke </p><p>of. If my people are to be your cats paw, </p><p>you must pay them. But my reward-” </p><p> “You shall be first in this kingdom,</p><p>under myself,” answered Dardanus. “You </p><p>shall have wealth untold, and all your men </p><p>shall be enriched from the plunder of our </p><p>foes. Your name will be great and go </p><p>down to our children’s children as the </p><p>savior of their race.” </p><p> “It is not enough,” said Ragnarr sternly.</p><p>“I do not fight for gold, for I can win </p><p>enough in trade; and as for fame, I have </p><p>that in my own land already. But you </p><p>have one thing which I value above gold </p><p>and jewels, above fame and very life. If </p><p>I sell you my sword, you must give me this.”</p><p>“Anything, noble Northman, anything, </p><p>saving only my crown itself,” protested </p><p>the king, with an understanding gleam in </p><p>his eye. “Ask and you shall receive.” </p><p>“Then this shall be my reward, if I can </p><p>win it,” said Ragnarr; “if I can not, I will </p><p>ask for nothing. Swear to me that if I can </p><p>win your daughter’s love, she shall be mine </p><p>so soon as your enemy is humbled.” </p><p> “I swear it!” cricd Dardanus, raising</p><p>both hands heavenward in his ardor. “By </p><p>our holy goddess, the Mother, I swear it!” </p><p> “Then our bargain is made,” said Rag-</p><p>narr, and seized the king’s hand in a joy- </p><p>ful grasp. </p><p> As he turned to descend the stair, the</p><p>old man smiled knowingly to himself, and </p><p>winked one cunning eye. </p><p>CHAPTER V </p><p>MORE THAN LIFE ITSELF </p><p>D ALA knelt on the mat, grinding wheat </p><p>in a stone mortar. Her lips were </p><p>pressed together ominously, and her fine </p><p>eyes were dark with sullen anger. </p><p> “I tell you I will not go, my lord,” she</p><p>declared. “What have I to do with that </p><p>Trojan lady, with her well-bred ways and </p><p>her finery? Did she save me from those </p><p>filthy savages? No. Who did? You. It </p><p>is clear, then, that since I owe my preserva- </p><p>tion to you and not to her, I must belong </p><p>to you and to no one else. I shall stay </p><p>with you till I die, unless—” and here her </p><p>rage threatened to drown itself in tears— </p><p>“unless you turn me away.” </p><p> Ragnarr mutely implored the gods for</p><p>aid. </p><p> “I do not turn you away, child. You</p><p>are a good girl and have served me well. </p><p>But-” </p><p> “Oh, fie, master!” she cried springing to</p><p>her feet, eyes flashing. “Served you well! </p><p>A good girl, am I? Am I no more to you </p><p>than that? Your hound serves you well </p><p>and is a good dog, but he gives you his soul </p><p>and gets in return—the bones from your </p><p>table, the scraps you are done with, your</p><p>Worship’s caress when you are pleased with </p><p>him, and—a kick when you weary of him. </p><p>I am no dog, but a woman with a heart </p><p>like yours, a mind, thoughts, feelings to </p><p>wound, eyes, a tongue-” </p><p>“No one denies that,” groaned Ragnarr. </p><p> “And I tell you I am not to be driven</p><p>away like a worn-out dog. You gave me </p><p>life and more than life, and I shall stay </p><p>with you, for something tells me that I </p><p>shall yet return the gift.” </p><p> She looked up at him imploringly, her</p><p>cheeks wet with big tears. </p><p> Ragnarr shook his head perplexedly.</p><p> “No, child,” he said after a moment.</p><p>“I am not made of stone, and I realize that </p><p>you are my faithful friend and servant; </p><p>IIO </p><p>Adventure </p><p>but you can not remain here. You are </p><p>among men who, though they love me and </p><p>obey me, are, after all, no better than most </p><p>men. I fear much that they may do you </p><p>mischief. Besides, it happens that you </p><p>can serve me best by serving the Lady Ilia, </p><p>who also is my good friend.” </p><p> Here Rala looked up, a dangerous gleam</p><p>in her eyes. </p><p> “She particularly asked me to send you</p><p>to her, and I gave my promise. Would </p><p>you have me break my word?” </p><p> The girl’s breast heaved stormily.</p><p> “I am a trouble to you!” she cried.</p><p>“You hate me and would be rid of me! </p><p>No, do not deny it! Well, I will please </p><p>you. I am your slave, the dirt under your </p><p>feet. I will fetch Valgard, who is fond of </p><p>me. If he bids me go, I will obey. He </p><p>will speak as he thinks, not as some fair </p><p>woman asks him to speak.” </p><p> She turned away and called Valgard’s</p><p>name. He came out from one of the tents, </p><p>his massive figure filling the door, his face </p><p>flushed and perspiring with the heat. It </p><p>was true that the tempestuous little acro- </p><p>bat and he had become strongly attached to </p><p>each other, both by the common bond of </p><p>their affection for Ragnarr and by the strong </p><p>cord that unites the hearts of all true ad- </p><p>venturers. </p><p> “Valgard!” cried Rala. “Your master</p><p>wishes to turn me out. The Princess Ilia </p><p>has conceived the whim of having a girl of </p><p>the people to serve her, and cajoled the </p><p>simple man into promising to turn his poor </p><p>slave over to her. What say you? Shall </p><p>I go? Or shall I defy him for his own good </p><p>and remain in spite of him?” </p><p> Valgard looked at her steadily, but with</p><p>unwonted tenderness in his fierce old eyes. </p><p> “See, lass,” he began, “you and I have</p><p>one end in life, one task to perform. We </p><p>are our lord’s, and our sole reason for con- </p><p>tinuing to be is to obey him. If he walk </p><p>on us, it is well. If he fondle us, well. If </p><p>he bid us tear out our hearts and eat them,</p><p>why, that is what we are here for. He did </p><p>not wait and debate when your life and </p><p>honor were at stake. You call yourself </p><p>his. Then serve him as his spear serves. </p><p>All is said.” </p><p> The girl flung herself face down on the</p><p>floor, sobbing piteously. Ragnarr stooped </p><p>to comfort her, but Valgard thrust him </p><p>back. </p><p> “Let be!” he whispered. “You can do</p><p>no good. She will come out of it herself.” </p><p>In a moment she sat up, humble and </p><p>submissive. </p><p> “When shall I go, master?” she asked,</p><p>her voice trembling. </p><p> “Tomorrow at noon, child. You could</p><p>not be with me longer, in any case, for I sail </p><p>at dawn of the next day.” </p><p> Rala gave a cry, her hand at her breast.</p><p>Valgard stared at him. </p><p> “May we know where, lord?” he asked.</p><p>“It is right that you two should know </p><p>first of all,” answered Ragnarr, “for of all </p><p>that are with me there are none truer. Sit </p><p>close by me, that other ears may not over- </p><p>hear. I go to Egypt, to arrange for a </p><p>mighty undertaking.” </p><p> So he told them all the story, leaving</p><p>out only that which concerned his love for </p><p>Ilia. Valgard took the affair quite as a </p><p>matter of course, but Rala’s face and ges- </p><p>tures showed the liveliest terror and con- </p><p>cern. </p><p> “Have nothing to do with this king and</p><p>his quarrels,” she begged. “Oh, if you </p><p>had seen Crete, if you but knew King </p><p>Minos, you would not lift a finger against </p><p>him. He is the descendant of the gods, </p><p>and they fight on his side. He always </p><p>conquers, and his foes are taken and sacri- </p><p>ficed to the Minotaur, to that which no. </p><p>man hath seen and lived to tell its shape. </p><p>If you oppose Minos, you perish.” </p><p>Ragnarr’s jaw set and he squared his </p><p>shoulders. </p><p> “Now you have done it, girl,” said Val-</p><p>gard. “Our master fears nothing except </p><p>fear. He will go now, you may be certain.”</p><p>“Listen, my lord,” Rala pleaded. “I </p><p>was born in Sicily, and was taken as a slave </p><p>by Cretans when but a tiny child. They </p><p>trained me in all athletic exercises, for I </p><p>was the daughter of a chief and doomed </p><p>to be a sacrifice to the bull, which they </p><p>worship. There are three degrees of the </p><p>sacrifice: the first, when the harvest is good </p><p>and fortune favors them, is the performance </p><p>of the sacred dance by captive youths and </p><p>maidens before all the people; the second, </p><p>when fortune frowns, is the combat with a </p><p>savage bull, which selected youths and </p><p>maidens must endure unarmed, and the </p><p>third is that of which no man may speak </p><p>with authority: captured warriors and </p><p>those selected by the oracle are offered up </p><p>to the Minotaur, and none know how they </p><p>die. </p><p>In the Grip of the Minotaur </p><p>hi </p><p> “I myself endured the bull-fight, and</p><p>survived; and soon after escaped through </p><p>the great drains of the palace and swam </p><p>out to a passing ship that bore me to Tiryns, </p><p>where my training in the bull-ring earned </p><p>me a place in that strolling band of acro- </p><p>bats, dispersed by the mob from whom </p><p>you saved me. But for you the Minotaur </p><p>waits.” </p><p> “I have sworn,” answered Ragnarr, and</p><p>strode out. </p><p> Valgard rose to follow him, but the girl</p><p>caught him by the sleeve. </p><p> “You are my only friend,” she pleaded.</p><p>“I am nothing to him. But I tell you, </p><p>Valgard, I love him, and if anything hap- </p><p>pens to hurt him, I shall die. Find some </p><p>way for me to go with him! I can not let </p><p>him go from me, not knowing what may </p><p>befall. Death is better, a thousand times </p><p>better, than waiting in the agony of uncer- </p><p>tainty, and hopeless, hopeless longing!” </p><p> Valgard laid his hand tenderly on her</p><p>head. </p><p> “Brave little comrade,” he said, “I would</p><p>give my shield-hand to help you, as Tyr </p><p>did for the gods. But our lord wills it </p><p>otherwise. We are but tools in his hand, </p><p>child. Can you not be a true tool?” </p><p> She seized his knotty hand and kissed it.</p><p> “I will be true, comrade,” she answered</p><p>stoutly. </p><p>THE day drew toward its close, </p><p>and the Northmen made haste to </p><p>sell the rest of their wares before </p><p>they were obliged to depart. Valgard and </p><p>the seaman Tyrleif stood behind the coun- </p><p>ter in the principal booth, while beside </p><p>them Hjalti, the bard, with nimble imagi- </p><p>nation, appealed to the crowd of prospective </p><p>purchasers in lurid phrases. Having called </p><p>attention to the rare beauty of the amber, </p><p>holding now a red piece, now a golden one, </p><p>up to the light to catch the fading beams </p><p>of the sun, he began to descant on t eir </p><p>virtues as amulets, swearing that they </p><p>would keep off the fever, sunstroke, palsy,</p><p>and the falling sickness. </p><p> One figure stood on the very edge of the</p><p>gaping crowd that packed the street out- </p><p>side the shallow front of the booth, a figure </p><p>that never moved, but kept its eyes fixed on </p><p>the shadowy interior of the tent. It was </p><p>a woman, her features wrapped in a volu- </p><p>minous veil which swathed her to the knees, </p><p>effectively disguising face and figure. To </p><p>her the gesticulating bard addressed him- </p><p>self in particular, declaring that the amber </p><p>nodule which he held in his hand was a sov- </p><p>ereign remedy for jealousy and barrenness. </p><p> Suddenly a shadow fell across the coun-</p><p>ter, and a hand struck the bit of amber </p><p>from his fingers. Immediately the crowd </p><p>made a rush for it, trampling and jostling </p><p>each other in their eagerness. </p><p> “Liar!” thundered Ragnarr at the trem-</p><p>bling Hjalti. “How often have I told you </p><p>that honest wares need no lying tales to </p><p>cheapen them? Go to your tent, and bide </p><p>till I-” </p><p> A muffled cry rang out, and Ragnarr</p><p>broke off, looking up swiftly. In the </p><p>scramble for the amber, a tall Phoenician </p><p>had trodden heavily on the foot of the veiled </p><p>lady, who had fallen against the rude rail- </p><p>ing that protected the counter. The veil </p><p>half fell from her face, revealing the features </p><p>of the Princess Ilia. </p><p> Ragnarr started violently. Then, as she</p><p>righted her veil, he sprang over the counter </p><p>and drew her round the angle of the booth </p><p>and in through the door. </p><p> “What do you here, lady?” he asked</p><p>anxiously. </p><p> “Follow me,” she answered softly. “This</p><p>is no place to talk.” </p><p> Calling to Valgard to keep the crowd</p><p>back, he opened the door-flap again and </p><p>they passed out swiftly. One or two of </p><p>the more curious started to follow them, </p><p>but Valgard’s shout brought a number of </p><p>sturdy Northmen who shoved these back </p><p>none too gently. </p><p> Swiftly Ilia led Ragnarr through the</p><p>main thoroughfare and toward the little</p><p>grove on the bank of the Scamander. </p><p>There, close by the water and shaded by a </p><p>clump of plane-trees, stood a stone bench </p><p>on which they seated themselves. The </p><p>westering sun dyed the river in crimson </p><p>stain, and the clouds were fringed with </p><p>crimson and opal. In the gathering dusk, </p><p>a slender figure crept up behind them un- </p><p>observed. </p><p> They sat in silence for a while, then she</p><p>spoke in slightly faltering tones: </p><p> “My father has told me that you are</p><p>going to Egypt,” she began. “I know </p><p>something of his purpose now, for he is </p><p>jubilant in his new hopes, and must un- </p><p>bosom himself to one whom he trusts. </p><p>Alas, I feared he planned some dangerous </p><p>task for you.” </p><p>112 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Why did you fear it, lady?” he asked</p><p>unsteadily. “Why should the peril of a </p><p>stranger give you concern?” </p><p> She hesitated, then spoke:</p><p> “I suppose, because you are unlike other</p><p>men. You seem above the evil and the </p><p>intrigue in which we are forced to live, and </p><p>your heart is too clean and gallant for a </p><p>king to sacrifice to his bloody purposes.” </p><p>She sighed very softly. </p><p> “Are they not necessary purposes?” he</p><p>demanded. </p><p> “They must be, or you would have naught</p><p>to do with them,” she answered. “You </p><p>would not do evil work, I know.” </p><p> “How do you know that? Why do you</p><p>trust me so?” </p><p> “Because my heart tells me that you</p><p>are good, better than our men are, and </p><p>truer.” </p><p> “You do not come to dissuade me, then?”</p><p>“No. I come to bid you farewell, to say </p><p>what I could not say tomorrow, in the sight </p><p>of all men. I came to tell you that I have </p><p>never known so kind and brave a spirit. </p><p>We may never see each other again, and </p><p>so I may say freely that you have brought </p><p>new faith, new gladness, into a heart op- </p><p>pressed with the sordid, petty ambitions </p><p>of a selfish court. My spirit is the better </p><p>for you, Ragnarr.” </p><p> He could no longer restrain himself; his</p><p>love for her burst the bonds of control. </p><p>He rose to his feet before her. </p><p> “As you say,” he began, “we may never</p><p>meet again. The sea is full of evil men </p><p>and evil forces, and it may be that I go to </p><p>the land beyond this life. Or the gods </p><p>may perhaps be kind and bring me back </p><p>again. I, too, can say now what I dared </p><p>not say before: I love you, Ilia, love you </p><p>with all that is within me. If I return, </p><p>can you give your heart to me?” </p><p> She rose and put both hands on his</p><p>shoulders.</p><p> “There is no concealment between you</p><p>and me,” she answered. “I have loved </p><p>you these many days. I think I began to </p><p>love you when first I saw you. Do you </p><p>remember? You had just landed and </p><p>Kamas led you through our streets. My </p><p>litter was passing through the crowd; all </p><p>others fell to their knees, but you alone </p><p>remained standing. I saw you towering </p><p>above them, and your face was so good, </p><p>so free from the servile littleness of our </p><p>men, that I felt my heart warm to you even </p><p>then. You saw me, too, and I knew that </p><p>you were not unmoved.” </p><p> He gave a cry of joy and caught her to</p><p>him. They clung together, lip to lip and </p><p>heart to heart, while the dark closed in </p><p>upon them. And now the golden moon </p><p>came up and flooded the river with radiance. </p><p>Gently, Ilia drew his arms from around her </p><p>and pointed to the sky pulsing with the </p><p>beauty of the stars. </p><p> “I must say farewell,” she said.</p><p> “Let us go, my heart’s beloved,” he</p><p>sighed. “If I stayed here alone with you </p><p>longer, my own heart would fail me for the </p><p>morrow.” </p><p> They stepped out from the shadow of the</p><p>plane-trees, and the moonlight fell full on </p><p>them. </p><p> “Hark!” said Ilia softly. “What is that?”</p><p> “It was only the river plashing on the</p><p>sand,” he answered, his arm stealing about </p><p>her waist. </p><p> But he was wrong. It was the sobbing</p><p>of a woman. </p><p>CHAPTER VI </p><p> THE MASTERS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN</p><p>TT WAS all-important for the success </p><p>of the old king’s plans that Ragnarr </p><p>should not seem to be more than a wealthy </p><p>merchant. He had been graciously received </p><p>at the palace upon his arrival, but that was </p><p>an honor accorded to all merchants of noble </p><p>blood. Now that he was about to depart, </p><p>however, any unwonted attention paid him</p><p>would attract the eyes of the multitude of </p><p>traders, foreign representatives, and spies </p><p>who crowded the fair, and perhaps start a </p><p>rumor which Crete might seize upon. He </p><p>must go quietly, and from the fair-grounds, </p><p>like any ordinary merchant. </p><p> His men were to enter Troy by the South-</p><p>west Gate, collect their weapons from the </p><p>Temple of the Mother and march out under </p><p>convoy to the street bordering the fair- </p><p>grounds and thence west to the Scamander </p><p>where their boats would be waiting. In </p><p>conformity with this scheme, therefore, </p><p>King Dardanus had caused Ragnarr to be </p><p>summoned secretly to him that very night, </p><p>only_a few hours after he had parted from </p><p>Ilia. Ragnarr took advantage of this sum- </p><p>mons to take Rala to the palace with him, </p><p>and found occasion to see her safely into </p><p>Ilia’s hands. </p><p>In the Grip of the Minotaur </p><p>113 </p><p> After a tender farewell to Ilia, he sought</p><p>the presence of the king. Having received </p><p>the letters for the Pharaoh and a few final </p><p>instructions from Dardanus, Ragnarr took </p><p>his leave, reminding the king of his prom- </p><p>ise with his parting words. </p><p> Next morning he began his preparations</p><p>for departure. The sail-cloth covering was </p><p>stripped from the booth and loaded into the </p><p>larger of the two boats. With Valgard and </p><p>six oarsmen he rowed down to the ship, </p><p>which the sailors, as soon as the unloading </p><p>had been completed, had pulled up, stern- </p><p>foremost, on the sandy shore of the bay for </p><p>a scraping and overhauling. Those left </p><p>with the ship, about fifty men, had camped </p><p>out on the beach and had been hospitably </p><p>cared for as guests of the coast-guard, by </p><p>special order of the king. </p><p> As soon as they set eyes upon their</p><p>prince, the sailors raised a mighty shout of </p><p>welcome, rushed to meet him, and crowded </p><p>round to shake his hand with that free </p><p>good-fellowship that characterized the rela- </p><p>tion of the Northman to his lord. </p><p> After greetings were said, Ragnarr and</p><p>his men launched the ship. They swarmed </p><p>first round the bow, then the stern, took </p><p>hold, lifted mightily and thrust the wooden </p><p>rollers under. All gathered round the stern, </p><p>half on each side, their thick shoulders </p><p>thrust against the planks, and shoved with </p><p>main force. The vessel heaved, settled, </p><p>then rushed down into the water. </p><p> Now some waded out, their hands on her</p><p>new-pitched sides, and held her; others </p><p>formed a chain from the shore and passed </p><p>along from man to man the sides of salt </p><p>meat, bags of grain, and crates of dried </p><p>fruit whch lay piled up on the beach, hav- </p><p>ing been ferried down the river by the </p><p>king’s orders, for their voyage. These were </p><p>stowed carefully in the shallow open hold </p><p>amidships, between the inboard ends of the </p><p>rowers’ benches, and on them, cushioned </p><p>and held in place with reed mats which pro- </p><p>tected the provisions from rain and spray, </p><p>were placed the clay jars of water and wine, </p><p>their mouths sealed with clay paste, and </p><p>stamped with the royal seal. </p><p> Then, by Ragnarr’s command, all but</p><p>Valgard, himself, and the crew of their boat, </p><p>swarmed over the galley’s sides, half to </p><p>port and half to starboard, to maintain her </p><p>balance. The oars were brought out and </p><p>thrust into the rowlocks, and the ship rowed </p><p>out to a safe depth and there anchored. </p><p>8 </p><p> Bidding the fifty bend on the sail and re-</p><p>main on board till he returned in mid-after- </p><p>noon, when he proposed to sail, Ragnarr </p><p>and the others re-embarked in their boat </p><p>and rowed back to the fair-ground, which </p><p>extended through the long, narrow plain </p><p>south of the city, westward to the Scaman- </p><p>der. </p><p>KING DARDANUS sat in a gild- </p><p>ed chair on the northern wall of his </p><p>citadel, whence he could look out </p><p>over the plain of Troy and the rolling hills </p><p>beyond, to the azure waters of the Helles- </p><p>pont. A gorgeously embroidered awning of </p><p>scarlet sheltered him from the almost verti- </p><p>cal rays of the noonday sun. Ilia sat beside </p><p>him, while behind stood Rala, fanning her </p><p>new mistress with a long-handled fan of </p><p>peacocks’ feathers. </p><p> The old king basked happily in the warm,</p><p>soothing air. He was aglow with mental </p><p>and bodily comfort. The day was glorious, </p><p>the view before his satisfied eyes was ra- </p><p>diant with beauty. This was his city, with </p><p>its gigantic walls, its temples and palaces, </p><p>its bursting granaries, and coffers full to </p><p>overflowing. Its men were his, their hands </p><p>quick to seize sword or shield at his bid- </p><p>ding. Best of all, he had found a mighty </p><p>friend and ally in this valiant Northman </p><p>who would bring to him the trade of his </p><p>far-off land, reopen to him the commerce </p><p>of the wide Mediterranean, and overwhelm </p><p>his cruel enemy and oppressor, Minos of </p><p>Crete. His cup was full, and he felt a deep </p><p>sense of satisfaction in his fair daughter, </p><p>whose white arms bound this brave deliverer </p><p>to him with the chains of love. </p><p> A white dot rose over the far edge of the</p><p>Hellespont. Dardanus chuckled softly to </p><p>himself, seeing in the tiny, far-off sail a </p><p>symbol of the numberless fleets which </p><p>should come so soon to Troy, bearing the </p><p>riches of all the world. He watched it grow </p><p>larger and larger, till, as the ship that bore</p><p>it tacked, a puzzled frown began to drive </p><p>the smile from his lips. </p><p> The one white spot had suddenly be-</p><p>come three! Rala, out of his sight behind </p><p>the chair, quietly laid down the fan, shield- </p><p>ed her eyes with her hands, and watched </p><p>intently. </p><p> “Daughter,” the king asked in a tone of</p><p>fretful bewilderment, “can you make out </p><p>the sails on yonder ship? My old eyes are </p><p>deceiving me, I think.” </p><p>H4 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “She has three sails, father,” Ilia respond-</p><p>ed, “but I am not sure of their shape, at </p><p>this distance.” </p><p> “If it please you, my lord,” interrupted</p><p>Rala, her voice trembling with excited fear, </p><p>“it is one of the long ships of Crete, with its </p><p>three square sails and countless oars which </p><p>flash in the sunlight.” </p><p> Dardanus sprang to his feet, his face livid.</p><p>“Oh, the cunning dogs!” he shrilled. </p><p>“Could they not wait another day? To </p><p>come now, when the prince’s galley is still </p><p>bound in the port! Have they eyes and </p><p>ears in the very walls of my chamber, to </p><p>learn my purposes as they leave my lips?” </p><p>He strode up and down, gnawing his fin- </p><p>gers. Suddenly the light of resolution came </p><p>into his eyes. He clapped his hands and a </p><p>soldier sprang round the corner of the wall </p><p>and stood before him, raising his shielded </p><p>arm. </p><p> “Go to Prince Ragnarr’s tent!” cried the</p><p>king imperiously. “Tell him to close his </p><p>business as soon as he may, hasten to his </p><p>ship and speed to his destination as fast as </p><p>sail and oars will bear him. Be swift!” </p><p> The messenger bowed low and departed.</p><p>Ragnarr stood by his dismantled booth, </p><p>superintending the labors of his men, who </p><p>were busily packing away the small rem- </p><p>nant of their wares and the money they </p><p>had taken, in strong boxes of cypress. </p><p>These were to be stored in the palace dur- </p><p>ing Ragnarr’s absence. Small bags of stout </p><p>cloth, tied tightly at the mouth, bulged with </p><p>disks of silver and gold. The knots which </p><p>secured them were sealed with balls of clay, </p><p>marked with the royal superscription. </p><p> One, crammed too full, had burst, and</p><p>Valgard with two sturdy helpers was thrust- </p><p>ing back the boldest of the crowd. It was </p><p>necessary to keep these folk in check, for </p><p>among them were many stout rogues who </p><p>would dare much to snatch a handful of </p><p>the shining pieces. Every now and then, </p><p>one more forward than the rest would drop </p><p>with a bloody crown under the blow of a </p><p>long tent-stake. Poles and pins were being </p><p>plucked up, and the cloths which had been </p><p>spread over them were folded and bound</p><p>securely. </p><p> “On the king’s errand! Make way!”</p><p>cried a voice. </p><p> The crowd parted to right and left, and</p><p>the messenger of Dardanus, his limbs streak- </p><p>ed with sweat and dust, stood before Rag- </p><p>narr. </p><p> “The king greets you, my lord,” he pant-</p><p>ed, “and bids you haste on your voyage </p><p>with all possible speed. To your ship! His </p><p>majesty hath spoken.” </p><p> Turning on his heel, the messenger sped</p><p>back through the crowd which again parted </p><p>to both sides to let him pass. </p><p> Ragnarr called on his men, urging them</p><p>to their utmost-endeavors. Bales and sacks </p><p>were thrust hurriedly into the chests, which </p><p>were bound with heavy ropes and laid in </p><p>order. </p><p> “Handle that painted jar with care, you</p><p>lout, or you taste my knuckles!” roared </p><p>Valgard. “There is mead enough left in it </p><p>to wet our throats twice around before we </p><p>see the ship!” </p><p> He turned swiftly and caught just above</p><p>the wrist a lean brown arm that had thrust </p><p>itself from the edge of the throng and </p><p>snatched up a tiny jeweled box, Rala’s </p><p>parting gift to the old warrior. A quick </p><p>movement of his fingers, a shrill yell of pain </p><p>from the thief, and the hand hung limp and </p><p>broken from the brown wrist. </p><p> Then a babel of wondering cries burst</p><p>forth in a dozen different tongues. Shrill- </p><p>voiced Egyptians clamored and pointed, </p><p>sharp-featured men of Sidon gesticulated </p><p>and chattered; all the multitude gave tongue </p><p>at once, their eyes and leveled arms direct- </p><p>ed toward the river. </p><p> Up the channel of the wide Scamander</p><p>came a ship, such a ship as Ragnarr had </p><p>never seen before, half again as long as his </p><p>own Gray Wolf. Narrow was her beam and </p><p>high her sides, even in the waist, from which </p><p>the lines of her hull soared upward to the </p><p>forked stem - post and pennoned stern. </p><p>Black was her paint from stern to shoulder, </p><p>but the prow was a bright vermilion. Very </p><p>many were the oars, and smooth their</p><p>rhythm, but the greatest marvel of all was </p><p>the three tall masts—yes, three—that tow- </p><p>ered above her deck. Each was crossed by </p><p>a single yard, carrying what looked like a </p><p>modern topgallant-sail, for unlike the ships </p><p>of the Northmen, this craft had her canvas </p><p>hoisted so high that a tall man could pass </p><p>under it with shouldered lance, even though </p><p>he stood on the raised fore-and-aft bridge. </p><p> Greatly did Ragnarr marvel to see men</p><p>swarm up the ladder-like shrouds of the </p><p>standing rigging, lay out on the yards, and </p><p>quickly furl the three sails as the ship drew </p><p>nigh to the landing place. The oars gradu- </p><p>ally diminished their beat till the dripping </p><p>In the Grip of the Minotaur </p><p>blades were tossed and held, while the two </p><p>broad steering-oars guided her in to the </p><p>landing. By the dazzling glint of the sun </p><p>on her gilded masts and carven, inlaid rail- </p><p>ings, she was clearly the galley of some </p><p>wealthy prince, some affluent sea-king of </p><p>the South. </p><p> The ship was made fast to the stone rings</p><p>in two of the granite posts of the fair-grounds’ </p><p>quay, a cleated gangway was lowered, and, </p><p>two by two, some thirty marines disem- </p><p>barked at the double and drew up on the </p><p>bank. They were men of uncommonly </p><p>short stature, broad - shouldered and </p><p>swarthy, almost copper-colored, with pinch- </p><p>ed-in waists confined in broad leathern belts. </p><p>From these hung short broadswords in em- </p><p>bossed scabbards. The hilts were of ivory </p><p>and the pommels of silver. </p><p> Each man wore a conical helmet of pol-</p><p>ished bronze, a gorgeously embroidered </p><p>waist-cloth above which shone the naked, </p><p>coppery breast, and leathern boots reach- </p><p>ing half-way up the leg. Some carried un- </p><p>bent bows in their hands and full quivers </p><p>suspended over their shoulders; the rest bore </p><p>long spears with leaf-shaped heads of bronze. </p><p> Down the gangway now strode two im-</p><p>pressive figures, a young man and an old. </p><p>The youth wore about his shoulders a rich </p><p>mantle of scarlet caught up with a golden </p><p>clasp; the hilt of his short sword was of </p><p>pure gold, with a gleaming jewel set in the </p><p>pommel. His shapely head was uncovered </p><p>and his jet-black hair dangled about his </p><p>cheeks in three long curls. </p><p> His face was handsome and his eyes in-</p><p>solent; a thin nose and two daintily curved </p><p>red lips proclaimed the aristocrat. His com- </p><p>panion, gray-haired and lantern-jawed, was </p><p>evidently a naval officer of high rank. His </p><p>helmet bore three red plumes, and an onyx- </p><p>hilted dagger was fixed diagonally across </p><p>the front of his girdle. At a curt command </p><p>from him, the marines wheeled and marched </p><p>up into the fair-ground, the two officers at </p><p>their head. </p><p> Up the street swung the warlike band,</p><p>shoulder to shoulder, chests thrust out, left </p><p>arms swinging slightly as the booted feet </p><p>came down in the crisp cadence of perfect </p><p>drill. Neither to right nor left they looked,</p><p>but straight ahead, with the eyes of men </p><p>who know themselves for masters, in what- </p><p>ever company. The crowd made way for </p><p>them as they came, giving the Cretans the </p><p>full width of the street. </p><p> Ragnarr seethed with indignation. What</p><p>were these swaggering fellows about, to vio- </p><p>late the sanctity of the fair by carrying </p><p>weapons within its precincts? How dared </p><p>they trample on a world - wide custom, </p><p>known to all men and violated only by pi- </p><p>rates? </p><p> On the offenders marched, till they came</p><p>to the corner of the Scasan Road where </p><p>their path was blocked by Valgard, tying </p><p>up one of the great bales. An officer ran </p><p>forward and rudely tried to thrust the </p><p>Northman out of the way. Valgard’s great </p><p>fist lashed out like the hoof of an angry </p><p>stallion, and the Cretan dropped, stunned </p><p>and bleeding. </p><p> The young commander gave a sharp</p><p>order in his native tongue. The column </p><p>jarred to a halt, except for the first four </p><p>marines who sprang round their two leaders </p><p>and closed in on Valgard with lowered pikes. </p><p>With one bound, Ragnarr confronted them, </p><p>spreading his arms between them and the </p><p>glaring old warrior. </p><p> “By the hand of Tyr!” he thundered.</p><p>“We are few and unarmed, and ye be many </p><p>and well able to slay us with those weapons </p><p>which ye bear here unlawfully. But, by </p><p>the crown of my father, if ye lay a hand on </p><p>any man of mine, some of you shall lie cold </p><p>before this day’s work is done!” </p><p> The crowd that had shrunk aside began</p><p>to return, scowling at the audacity of the </p><p>armed Cretans, but none daring to raise </p><p>voice or hand against the intruders. Even </p><p>the half-company of Trojan archers that </p><p>policed the fair and now stood close behind </p><p>the Northmen, hesitated to defend the sanc- </p><p>tity of the place and the sovereign rights of </p><p>Troy against the insolence of the masters </p><p>of the sea. </p><p> “Remove those fellows!” cried the Cretan</p><p>commander, and the four marines, who had </p><p>hesitated at the intrusion of the blue-eyed </p><p>giant, again rushed at Valgard. </p><p> But Ragnarr seized the foremost by the</p><p>throat, swung him off his feet, and snatched </p><p>the short sword from the Cretan’s scabbard. </p><p>Swinging the broad blade between Valgard </p><p>and his foes, the prince kept the three at </p><p>bay, while his voice rang in the ears of the </p><p>multitude like a trumpet. </p><p> “Fellow-merchants!” he cried. “These</p><p>men have broken your law, have trampled </p><p>on your sacred privileges, bearing their </p><p>wicked weapons into this holy ground. </p><p>They even dare to threaten your lives, to </p><p>116 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>seize your fellows from your very midst; and </p><p>ye stand idle! If ye submit to this, which </p><p>of you know that he may not be the next </p><p>victim of these pirates’ insolence? And ye, </p><p>soldiers of Troy, do ye hesitate to avenge </p><p>the affront to your king and your mighty </p><p>city? Shall it be said that he who has tasted </p><p>the salt of Dardanus died defending your </p><p>laws, while ye stood by unresisting? If so, </p><p>then be your land accursed and may its </p><p>people perish, as cowards must, beneath the </p><p>pitiless swords of murderers such as these!” </p><p>A murmur rose among the multitude, </p><p>swelled louder and louder, till it burst in a </p><p>yell of rage. Unarmed as they were, the </p><p>more daring closed in upon the Cretan </p><p>spearmen. </p><p> “He is right!” shouted a Trojan archer, and</p><p>his comrades raised a shout of affirmation. </p><p> The two parties faced each other like</p><p>surly dogs, the mob lashing itself into fury, </p><p>the police gripping their sword-hilts and </p><p>scowling upon the invaders, who remained </p><p>calmly waiting for their commander to give </p><p>the next order. </p><p> Biting his lips, the young Cretan strode</p><p>out from beside his companion and con- </p><p>fronted Ragnarr. </p><p> “It had been well for you, barbarian,” he</p><p>said contemptuously, “if you had never de- </p><p>fied the majesty of Crete. Know that I </p><p>am Ambrogeos, first-born of Minos the </p><p>Great, who is Son of the Bull and King of </p><p>Kings. Yield now while you may, and may- </p><p>hap you shall die by the sword; but strike </p><p>another blow and you and all your wretched </p><p>company shall feed the Minotaur!” </p><p> Ragnarr looked down upon him, his blue</p><p>eyes blazing. </p><p> “I yield to no pirate,” he answered grim-</p><p>ly. “Nor do I boast; but as to dying by </p><p>the sword, we will sacrifice a Cretan calf </p><p>to Tyr before we board the Ship of Death.” </p><p>The two gazed at each other long and </p><p>unflinchingly, till at last the black eyes fell </p><p>before the sword-like blue. Ambrogeos </p><p>clenched and unclenched his fingers, his </p><p>breast swelled with rage, and he turned </p><p>toward his men, his Ups parted for the fatal</p><p>command that should plunge them all into </p><p>bloody conflict. But before he could utter </p><p>the words, his lantern-jawed companion laid </p><p>a bony hand on the youth’s smooth shoul- </p><p>der and whispered in the Cretan tongue: </p><p>“My lord, these must be the men whom </p><p>we seek. Remember, they must be taken </p><p>alive, that the Minotaur may have a full </p><p>meal. They will not yield without a fight; </p><p>but that old craven in the palace yonder </p><p>may easily be persuaded to hand them over </p><p>to us without the loss of a single Cretan life. </p><p>Restrain yourself for the present and soon </p><p>they shall be ours.” </p><p> Ambrogeos nodded curtly and turned his</p><p>back on Ragnarr. In response to a gesture </p><p>of command, two marines detached them- </p><p>selves from the ranks and ran swiftly back to </p><p>the ship. The rest closed up, the old admiral </p><p>barked out a sharp word of command, and </p><p>the marines swung smartly to the left, and </p><p>took up their march toward the Sczean Gate. </p><p> The mongrel crowd burst into hoots and</p><p>jeers, with derisive signs and obscene ges- </p><p>tures of defiance. The Northmen gazed </p><p>after the departing Cretans with stern hos- </p><p>tility, and Ragnarr, scornfully throwing </p><p>down the captured sword, turned again to </p><p>his task. </p><p> Acharsis, the captain of archers who had</p><p>stood by him so well in the street fight with </p><p>the wild lumbermen, now left his grinning </p><p>bowmen and stepped up to Ragnarr. </p><p> “My lord,” he began, “you have won</p><p>your point and they will not disturb you on </p><p>the fair-grounds again. But if I do not err, </p><p>those two fellows who were sent to the gal- </p><p>ley yonder have carried the command that </p><p>you be seized and slain if you stir from the </p><p>sacred precincts. Here you are safe; but </p><p>embark on the river, as you now seem plan- </p><p>ning to do, and you are lost.” </p><p> “Friend,” answered Ragnarr, “I have</p><p>here the sign and seal of your king, giving </p><p>me safe conduct out of this land, and au- </p><p>thority to transact certain business in his </p><p>name. This is my guaranty, and surely you </p><p>and all your fellow-soldiers will enforce your </p><p>monarch’s word.” </p><p> “No, my lord,” answered Acharsis sadly,</p><p>“these pirates respect no king but their</p><p>own, and I have no orders to plunge my </p><p>land into a war with Minos.” </p><p> “Then there is nothing but to remain</p><p>here till the Cretans please to depart?” </p><p>“Nothing, my lord,” answered Acharsis. </p><p>“But I will see that you do not lack food </p><p>and drink until the king can act.” </p><p>THE Cretans marched in through </p><p>the Sctean Gate, the guards, by the </p><p>orders of the badly frightened Dar </p><p>danus, permitting the armed strangers t( </p><p>enter unchallenged. The old admiral pick </p><p>ed out the stately residence of a Trojar </p><p> LAJL-4.J</p><p>fFl </p><p>In the Grip of the Minotaur </p><p>117 </p><p>noble, and sent the swaggering little com- </p><p>pany in charge of a petty officer to com- </p><p>mandeer the place for quarters during their </p><p>stay in Troy. Then he and the Prince Am- </p><p>brogeos mounted the stately street to the </p><p>citadel. </p><p> Dardanus sat alone in the great throne-</p><p>room, biting his nails and staring helplessly </p><p>at the heroic figures of his ancestors paint- </p><p>ed on the walls. Fear, rage and cunning </p><p>played over his features in swift succession. </p><p>It could be no common errand which had </p><p>brought the son of Minos, unheralded, to </p><p>Troy. </p><p> What if the Cretan suspected his</p><p>schemes? Oh, if he had but a few hours </p><p>more! There must be some way, some es- </p><p>cape from this unlucky situation. He would </p><p>do anything, give more tribute, pay homage, </p><p>no matter what, to allay his enemy’s suspi- </p><p>cions till his plans could blossom and bear </p><p>fruit. </p><p> Imperiously waving guards and ushers</p><p>aside, Ambrogeos of Crete entered the broad </p><p>doorway, followed by his admiral, Rhodon- </p><p>thos. Ignoring the courteous address of </p><p>welcome which Dardanus had prepared, and </p><p>now rose to deliver, he strode to the very </p><p>dais. His face was flushed with passion, </p><p>and in a voice which anger choked, he de- </p><p>manded of the king: </p><p> “What does it mean, thou dog of Minos,</p><p>that strangers dare insult our sacred person </p><p>before thy very gates? Is this city so swol- </p><p>len with its pride that its bastard depend- </p><p>ents think to raise their heads against the </p><p>king of kings? What payment dost thou </p><p>hope to make for an offense as black as </p><p>this?” </p><p> Poor Dardanus cowered in his cushioned</p><p>throne, his jaw drooped and his wizened </p><p>face blanched. </p><p> “What have I done to deserve this, most</p><p>gracious prince?” he pleaded. “Tell me </p><p>who has so offended, and I will smite off </p><p>his head and have it stuck on a pole.” </p><p> The prince’s utterance was choked and</p><p>the veins swelled on his temples. Wrath</p><p>had been boiling in him since Ragnarr had </p><p>outfaced him before his own men, and his </p><p>humiliated pride clamored for revenge. </p><p>Rhodonthos spoke for him, for Ambrogeos </p><p>Avas incapable of utterance. </p><p> “It is this, King Dardanus. We had just</p><p>landed and were proceeding peacefully </p><p>through the fair, when a stout rascal blun- </p><p>dered into our path. The Captain Staltes </p><p>undertook to remove him, and the fellow </p><p>smote Staltes with his fist, hurting him sore- </p><p>ly. We would have laid hands upon him, </p><p>but his master, whom I heard called Rag- </p><p>narr, interfered, threatening us with a sword </p><p>which he had seized from one of our own </p><p>men. When we resented his deed, he dared </p><p>to insult the sacred person of our prince and </p><p>even menaced him with death. We would </p><p>have dealt with him as he deserved, had not </p><p>the mob, encouraged by your troops, O </p><p>king, given him their support. This de- </p><p>mands investigation—look you.” </p><p> The old king’s terror was pitiful to see.</p><p>Oh, if that luckless Northman had only </p><p>taken himself off before the prince ar- </p><p>rived! </p><p> Now Dardanus must choose between his</p><p>schemes, promises and hopes, and the wrath </p><p>of Minos, which was destruction. Sudden- </p><p>ly a thought came to him. If he could dis- </p><p>avow the deed of Ragnarr, it might be pos- </p><p>sible to soothe the Cretan with promises of </p><p>amends and goodly gifts, and so hold him </p><p>in the palace discussing terms till the North- </p><p>men were gone. Then it would be too late </p><p>for his plans to be checked, and all might be </p><p>well in the end, albeit at some cost to his </p><p>treasury. </p><p> “Good Prince Ambrogeos,” he said, in</p><p>wheedling tones, “these wretched fellows </p><p>are no subjects of mine, but base barbarians </p><p>from the North, who came hither to trade. </p><p>You have my word-” </p><p> “By the Bull!” shouted Ambrogeos, his</p><p>eyes gleaming with triumph. “These are </p><p>the very men I seek! Know, Dardanus, </p><p>that I have come all the long way from </p><p>Crete to fetch these fellows to my father, </p><p>who has heard that they are the forerunners </p><p>of great fleets from their own land to cheat </p><p>us of the trade of all the seas. Our spies </p><p>report that they are dealing in tin, which,</p><p>as you know, it is forbidden to carry save </p><p>in Cretan bottoms. King Minos, in his </p><p>wisdom, has determined to have these bar- </p><p>barians and feed them to the Minotaur! </p><p>Thus we shall discourage those who seek </p><p>to rob us. Give them to me, and you shall </p><p>be purged of the offense they have com- </p><p>mitted.” </p><p> Dardanus buried his face in his hands.</p><p>It was all over, his cherished dream of free- </p><p>dom and empire. He must die as he had </p><p>lived, the dog of Minos. Resentment stir- </p><p>red in his heart. He would make a last </p><p>stand for his hopes. </p><p>118 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>SLIPPING a piece, of gold into the </p><p>guardsman’s hand, Rala stole away </p><p>from the curtained door, her eyes </p><p>wide with terror. She ran wildly down the </p><p>corridor, her bare feet falling noiselessly on </p><p>the pavement. Ragnarr’s life was in dan- </p><p>ger, and she alone could rescue him. </p><p> Her thoughts kept pace with her flying</p><p>feet. As she turned the corner of the great </p><p>stair, she collided with a white figure which </p><p>seized her with clinging arms. It was Ilia. </p><p> “Let me go!” cried Rala. “Let me go to</p><p>him! I must save him!” </p><p> “Save whom?” asked the princess coolly;</p><p>then, even as she spoke, her heart turned </p><p>cold with fear. </p><p> “Speak, girl!” she commanded. “What</p><p>threatens him? Tell me, and it may be that </p><p>I can help you.” </p><p> The frightened girl poured forth her story.</p><p>Knowing what she did of Ragnarr’s busi- </p><p>ness with the king, she had suspected some </p><p>connection between this and the Cretan </p><p>visitation, and feared for his safety. When </p><p>she had heard loud voices in the throne- </p><p>room and recognized the accents of the Cre- </p><p>tan court, she had bribed the guard to let </p><p>her listen at the door and had heard all. </p><p> Ilia’s face turned pale. “Go to my cham-</p><p>ber,” she commanded. “Wait there for </p><p>me. It may be that I can say that which </p><p>will strengthen my father’s heart against </p><p>this cruel prince. If I fail, I shall send you </p><p>to the Lord Ragnarr.” </p><p> So saying, Ilia walked swiftly toward the</p><p>throne-room. As she drew near the en- </p><p>trance, she heard a voice crying in tones of </p><p>anger: </p><p> “Enough of your temporizing! Deliver</p><p>me these Northmen, to die the nameless </p><p>death, or I will come with ships beyond </p><p>number, blockade your ports, and, when it </p><p>pleases me, destroy your walls and stamp </p><p>your city flat. Those whom I take I will </p><p>slay, and all of noble blood, yourself among </p><p>them, I will give to the insatiate hunger of </p><p>the Minotaur!”</p><p>CHAPTER VII </p><p>THE NIGHT OF TYR </p><p>TLIA stood hidden in the shadow of </p><p>the doorway, watching her father’s </p><p>face. She saw terror w'ritten on it, and help- </p><p>less acquiescence. The sight made her blush </p><p>with rage and shame: rage at the Cretan’s </p><p>bloodthirsty arrogance, and shame at her </p><p>father’s weakness. Little did she know </p><p>how powerless he was against the vast naval </p><p>power of Minos. </p><p> She had seen enough. She swept into the</p><p>room, head held high, eyes blazing with out- </p><p>raged majesty and offended womanhood. </p><p>Without waiting for them to notice her, she </p><p>raised her voice in a torrent of indignation. </p><p> “You base and evil men!” she cried.</p><p>“Offspring of a wicked race! What you pro- </p><p>pose is infamy. If you could enforce your </p><p>cruel threats, do you dream that Troy </p><p>would hesitate to choose between shame </p><p>and destruction? Better to die a thousand </p><p>deaths than yield up to murderers him with </p><p>whom we have broken bread! But you can </p><p>not conquer us. Every man will die, every </p><p>woman will put on armor and shed the last </p><p>drop of her blood before we will listen to </p><p>your vile proposals. The Trojan mother </p><p>would curse the son who had saved his life </p><p>by yielding; the maiden would send her </p><p>lover to unending sleep rather than clasp a </p><p>living coward in her arms. </p><p> “And you, my father, who have called</p><p>yourself a king! Will you barter your hon- </p><p>or and cheapen your royal crown for a few </p><p>brief years of comfortable life and the hol- </p><p>low sham of a power that others wield? </p><p>Will you be a puppet and dabble your with- </p><p>ered hands in corruption while the Cretan </p><p>pulls the strings? If I thought so, I would </p><p>renounce you, spit upon your name, and </p><p>call my mother harlot, sooner than own </p><p>you father! </p><p> “Oh, does your heart not pulse even now</p><p>with one drop of that heroic blood which </p><p>men say ran in your youthful veins, when </p><p>you destroyed the warlike race that inhab- </p><p>ited this land before you, and slew their </p><p>king in single combat on the plain? Are </p><p>you that fiery Dardanus who scaled the</p><p>wall of Abydos before a single soldier reach- </p><p>ed its base? Are you that king who built </p><p>these mighty ramparts round our city, de- </p><p>fying, as the poets sing, a world in arms to </p><p>take it from you? If you are he, then hurl </p><p>these infamous ones into your deepest dun- </p><p>geon and send your defiance thundering </p><p>about the ears of bloody Minos!” </p><p> She stood there like an incarnate goddess</p><p>in the robes of her majesty, exhorting an </p><p>erring world to righteousness. </p><p> The Cretans had turned at the first ring-</p><p>ing word. Ambrogeos stood like one who </p><p>sees a vision, his handsome face expressing </p><p>In the Grip of the Minotaur </p><p>119 </p><p>the liveliest admiration. Cleared of the dis- </p><p>figuring mask of wrath, his features, though </p><p>haughty, appeared delicate, almost effemi- </p><p>nate. While Ilia spoke, he never lifted his </p><p>dark eyes from her. </p><p> Dardanus groaned aloud. “Oh, my</p><p>daughter!” he sighed. “How little you </p><p>know the strength of fate! I was that Dar- </p><p>danus, that fiery, heroic youth, while the </p><p>Island Empire chose to let me indulge my </p><p>splendid dreams. But long before you were </p><p>bom, my child, the young, all-powerful </p><p>Minos chafed at my soaring ambition and </p><p>placed upon my neck the weary yoke that </p><p>now crushes me to the tomb!” </p><p> “Then rise, my father, shake off the yoke,</p><p>and if you can not live heroically, then at </p><p>least seek a hero’s death!” </p><p> “Alas, it is too late. The countless gal-</p><p>leys of the sea-king would lie in every port </p><p>and conquer us with the arms of starvation </p><p>and poverty. Can you not see, child, that </p><p>there is rio hope for the land cut off from </p><p>the sea?” </p><p> Ilia bowed her glorious head, tears of</p><p>rage and shame in her brave eyes. Yet she </p><p>was not conquered. She was fighting for </p><p>love, for honor, for all that makes life worth </p><p>living; and she threw back her head with </p><p>the color surging to her cheeks and lips </p><p>parted to utter further defiance, when in </p><p>broke the insolent voice of Ambrogeos. </p><p> “O Dardanus, your daughter’s words</p><p>have found an echo in my heart. She is a </p><p>maid of rare spirit, fit for a hero’s bride, </p><p>and her beauty passes the loveliness of the </p><p>Goddess Ariadne. Her splendor has over- </p><p>come me, and I relent. Give her to me in </p><p>marriage and I swear to you by the sacred </p><p>voice of Dicta; that I will spare these con- </p><p>tumacious barbarians, freely forgive their </p><p>crimes and the guilt of your city, and remit </p><p>half of the yearly tribute.” </p><p> The helpless king snatched at this shame-</p><p>ful hope, and with a sorry attempt at re- </p><p>sumption of his dignity, gave his consent. </p><p>Ilia fell at her father’s feet, her face white </p><p>with terror, her arms clasping his knees. </p><p> “Oh, unsay it!” she begged. “Remember</p><p>your promise! How can you give me to </p><p>this man—you who have cherished me all </p><p>these years?” </p><p> She turned and knelt to Ambrogeos. “If</p><p>there is one spark of tenderness in your </p><p>breast,” she begged, “spare these innocent </p><p>men; and do not stain your generosity with </p><p>violence to a helpless girl.” </p><p> The face of Ambrogeos lit up with unholy</p><p>joy. “Ah, now I see!” he cried. “You love </p><p>this tall barbarian, and would have both his </p><p>life and his love. You yourself have forged </p><p>the weapon with which I shall pierce his </p><p>breast. And to you, king of a wretched </p><p>race, I offer this choice: give me this girl </p><p>this very night and all will be well. I will </p><p>even spare the Northman’s life. But deny </p><p>me, and I slay the fellow with all his men, </p><p>and return to my father with words that </p><p>shall bring famine, fire and sword about </p><p>your heads. All shall perish—men, women, </p><p>maidens, and tender babes, and with them </p><p>the very name of Troy!” </p><p> Ilia rose to her feet, pale, but mistress of</p><p>herself. </p><p> “I will answer for the king,” she said in</p><p>cold, firm tones. “His Majesty consents, </p><p>not from fear for himself, since he scorns </p><p>you, but to save his people.” </p><p> And with head proudly raised, she walked</p><p>from the room. </p><p>fggBf RALA fluttered about the chamber </p><p>of the princess in a fever of impa- </p><p>tience. Suddenly’the curtains were </p><p>thrust aside and, eyes staring with horror, </p><p>Ilia rushed in, fell upon the couch and burst </p><p>into violent weeping. Rala ran to her, her </p><p>own heart hammering at her ribs with fear. </p><p>“You have failed?” she cried. </p><p> “I have succeeded,” sobbed Ilia; and as</p><p>best she could she told the story, her stream- </p><p>ing tears choking her utterances. </p><p> For a moment cruel joy filled Rala’s</p><p>heart; then the words of Valgard came into </p><p>her mind: “We are but tools in his hand, </p><p>child. Can you not be a true tool?” Crush- </p><p>ing the rising hope, she said gently: </p><p> “Princess, I have dared to love him too;</p><p>but he has given his heart to you. We have </p><p>both lost him now; but we have this com- </p><p>fort, that he is safe.” </p><p> “The gods be praised for that!” mur-</p><p>mured Ilia. “But I must give him up—and </p><p>for what?” </p><p> “For what indeed?” thought Rala, as</p><p>the splendors and cruelties of Crete flashed </p><p>before her; and with the thought, a sharp </p><p>suspicion entered her mind. </p><p> “Listen, princess!” she cried. “I have</p><p>lived among these Cretans and know them </p><p>for a cruel folk who do not value promises </p><p>over highly. What if Ambrogeos should </p><p>but postpone his vengeance, and return to </p><p>seek it after you are his?” </p><p>120 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Ilia sat up, gasping. “Do you think he</p><p>would?” she cried. </p><p> “I am sure of it. He does not look or</p><p>speak like one who leaves a single purpose </p><p>unfulfilled.” </p><p> The princess rose to her feet, her hands</p><p>clenched. “Oh, is no sacrifice enough?” she </p><p>cried passionately. “Will no tears appease </p><p>the gods? Must they have blood?” </p><p>Forgetful of rank, Rala grasped her mis- </p><p>tress by the arm. “I have it,” she whis- </p><p>pered. “I have a knife here, hidden in the </p><p>folds of my girdle. I have had it since </p><p>those wild men attacked me, lest I should </p><p>need deliverance again, when none were </p><p>near to help me. I will creep to this Cre- </p><p>tan’s chamber and stab him as he sleeps.” </p><p>“And would that keep off the wrath of </p><p>Minos, silly girl!” exclaimed Ilia. “No, </p><p>there is a better way. Ragnarr’s life is safe </p><p>for a time, for the prince’s word holds good </p><p>at least till I am his. Do you steal out of </p><p>the city and hasten to Ragnarr. Tell him </p><p>all that has happened, and command him, </p><p>in my name, to flee. Tell him how I loved </p><p>him, even enough for this, and say that I </p><p>shall die if misfortune overtakes him. </p><p>Stay!” she called, as Rala ran to the door. </p><p>“Come with me, for I know a secret way </p><p>that will lead you to him swiftly.” </p><p> Ilia lit a small lamp, took Rala by the</p><p>hand, all difference forgotten in their com- </p><p>mon love; and the two stumbled through </p><p>dark corridors and around drafty corners </p><p>till they stood in a wing of the palace which </p><p>was still blocked with the scaffolds and leav- </p><p>ings of carpenter and mason, for it was not </p><p>yet finished. Here, in a certain angle of </p><p>the wall, they stopped, and Ilia, tugging at </p><p>a sunken ring, swung open a tall stone pan- </p><p>el wide enough to admit a man. She thrust </p><p>the lamp into Rala’s hands. </p><p> “I know the way,” she said. “My father</p><p>planned it himself and showed it to me but </p><p>a fortnight ago. None others know of it. </p><p>Haste!” </p><p> The columned hall rang with the laughter</p><p>of a merry company, assembled in honor of </p><p>the royal guest, Ambrogeos, Prince of Crete. </p><p>King Dardanus, his face almost happy with</p><p>relief, pledged the noble Cretan again and </p><p>again. The betrothal was not announced, </p><p>though the king had pleaded for it, for </p><p>Ambrogeos intimated that certain matters </p><p>must be settled first. </p><p> Ilia sat at the prince’s right, and her eyes</p><p>sparkled with apparent happiness as she </p><p>met the admiring gaze of her betrothed. </p><p>She had never been more beautiful, and </p><p>Ambrogeos could not look away from her. </p><p>More than one gay lady nudged the cour- </p><p>tier next her, and it was whispered that the </p><p>princess had made a conquest which might </p><p>be turned to the advantage of the realm. </p><p>But ever and again a hunted look crept into </p><p>Ilia’s eyes, and the roses in her cheeks </p><p>seemed to fade. </p><p> When the guests had gone, Ambrogeos</p><p>turned to his host. </p><p> “And now,” he said, “let us talk. I have</p><p>said that I love your daughter, and it is so. </p><p>But it chances that my father, in his wis- </p><p>dom, desires me to wed the daughter of the </p><p>Pharaoh Amenothes; and as matters have </p><p>gone some lengths, you can understand that </p><p>it would be impolitic to break off the affair. </p><p>This is why I desire that my marriage with </p><p>the Princess Ilia be held at once; moreover, </p><p>it must be secret. And after a few days of </p><p>happiness, I shall leave this city and return </p><p>to my father. Then I sail to Crete, to con- </p><p>clude matters there. It is necessary that </p><p>no word be said of our marriage until I have </p><p>won the Pharaoh’s daughter, lest the pro- </p><p>posed Egyptian alliance be broken off, and </p><p>great harm follow. When all is settled, I </p><p>shall come back and claim my bride.” </p><p>“But,” Dardanus protested indignantly, </p><p>“do you propose to make my daughter a </p><p>concubine?” </p><p> “Far from it,” answered Ambrogeos in</p><p>the most friendly manner. “I shall have </p><p>married her first, and by the custom of my </p><p>land, she will be my queen. The Egyptian </p><p>will suppose herself the first, and will not </p><p>learn of her ill-fortune until she and I are </p><p>safely married. Then it will be too late; </p><p>she will be mine and the alliance confirmed. </p><p>I swear most solemnly that Ilia, whom I </p><p>love most dearly, shall be my queen.” </p><p>Dardanus smiled, well satisfied. Polyga- </p><p>my was to him an established fact, and the </p><p>first wife, as head of the household, was</p><p>well off. Besides, what an honor to Troy </p><p>that his daughter should take precedence </p><p>over a princess of Great Egypt, a Daughter </p><p>of the Sun! </p><p>RALA hurried on as fast as she </p><p>dared, but had to lessen her pace </p><p>frequently for fear of putting out </p><p>the flickering flame of her olive-oil lamp. </p><p>The passage first wound about in conform- </p><p>ance to the architecture of the palace, then </p><p>In the Grip of the Minotaur </p><p>121 </p><p>ran straight down at a uniform slope </p><p>through the heart of the hill. Presently it </p><p>opened out into a wide vault, which, Rala </p><p>knew from its position, must be the cellar </p><p>of the Temple of the Mother. </p><p> A thought flashed into her mind, and she</p><p>paused to raise the lamp and examine the </p><p>low roof above her. Yes, there was the </p><p>place where one of the ringed stone blocks </p><p>stood in the temple court, for she could see </p><p>crevices about its edges, wider than those </p><p>between the other stones. </p><p> The girl hurried on, and now it was not</p><p>long before she felt the air freshen, and a </p><p>gust of wind puffed out her light. She felt </p><p>her way along the wall for a few yards more </p><p>and emerged on to the plain close by the </p><p>river-bank. </p><p> In sheer surprise, Rala stopped short and</p><p>gazed up toward the sky. The air was raw, </p><p>and a thick fog was rolling in from the sea. </p><p>Moisture is so infrequent in the Troad that </p><p>the girl, superstitious like all the folk of </p><p>her time, was filled with awe. Nevertheless, </p><p>she remembered her errand and strove to </p><p>get her bearings. </p><p> Before her ran the Scamander; from the</p><p>left came the multitudinous murmurings of </p><p>the unseen fairgrounds, muffled by the fog. </p><p>Suddenly a hand touched her shoulder, a </p><p>familiar voice sounded in her ear, and be- </p><p>side her stood old Valgard. </p><p> “You, child!” he whispered. “Nay, no</p><p>noise. We are too near that painted ship </p><p>and enemies may hear us. I had crept up </p><p>on her to get what wisdom I could. This </p><p>way, and we will soon be with friends.” </p><p> He guided her back to the grounds and</p><p>through the dark, fog-wrapped streets, his </p><p>seaman’s instinct steering him infallibly, till </p><p>at last they came to the familiar spot where </p><p>the Northmen’s tents had been partially re- </p><p>erected. </p><p> “Here is a friend, master,” he called to</p><p>Ragnarr, who rose from his wooden stool </p><p>and came to greet them. “This is Tyr’s </p><p>own night; I have not felt a good fog for </p><p>weeks and it minds me of home.”</p><p> Ragnarr took the girl’s hands in his and</p><p>led her to the fire, then wrapped her in a warm </p><p>woolen mantle. His eyes bespoke anxiety. </p><p> “What is it, child?” he asked. “Is your</p><p>mistress well?” </p><p> Rala told her story swiftly, with rapid,</p><p>eloquent gestures. All the pantomimist’s </p><p>art was hers, and the tale sank deep into the </p><p>hearts of the hearers. </p><p> “So she bids you flee,” she concluded.</p><p>“Get to your ship while ye may, and escape, </p><p>for her sake, aye—and for mine too.” </p><p> Her voice failed her, and the tears came.</p><p>“Nay, by Tyr and the Gray Sword!” </p><p>cried Ragnarr, his face terrible with grief </p><p>and rage. “Men, will ye follow me tonight </p><p>in a desperate venture that may mean </p><p>death?” </p><p> “Aye, master!” they cried, crowding</p><p>around him, their rough faces kindled with </p><p>the exaltation of battle. “We will follow </p><p>where the Gray Sword leads!” </p><p> “But you are unarmed!” protested Rala,</p><p>panic-stricken. </p><p> “Our boats are moored just astern of the</p><p>Cretan galley,” said Ragnarr. “There is </p><p>one chance in ten that we can reach them </p><p>unobserved.” </p><p> “Nay, master,” old Valgard interrupted.</p><p>“I have just returned from the shore where, </p><p>having crept up through the darkness and </p><p>the fog, I loosed the boats one after another </p><p>and drew them an arrow-fiight down-stream. </p><p>In this blackness we can easily reach them </p><p>undiscovered and go to sea.” </p><p> “Thou art one in a thousand!” cried Rag-</p><p>narr warmly. “Lead us to the boats! We </p><p>will row swiftly down to the Gray Wolf and </p><p>bring her softly up-stream with all our good </p><p>fellows who have been expecting us these </p><p>many hours. Above here we will land again; </p><p>Rala shall lead us through the secret passage </p><p>she speaks of; and there will be unbidden </p><p>guests at this princeling’s wedding!” </p><p> The men would have raised a tremendous</p><p>shout had not Ragnarr quickly forestalled </p><p>them, for silence was vital to the success of</p><p>their enterprise. </p><p> The fog had spoiled all the pleasure of</p><p>the fair. The streets were empty even of </p><p>patrolling archers; and from close-shut </p><p>booth and hut came loud grumblings and </p><p>louder snores, as sixteen mighty figures and </p><p>one little one filed softly down to the shore, </p><p>unseen. Rala walked beside Ragnarr, who, </p><p>as if to manifest his gratitude for her plucky </p><p>efforts to save him, showed the utmost gen- </p><p>tleness in helping her through the filthy un- </p><p>lit alleys, half-blocked with everybody’s </p><p>bales, huge pieces of straw-matting, shards </p><p>of broken wine-jugs, and an Oriental luxuri- </p><p>ance of garbage. </p><p> Old Valgard led them to the river-bank,</p><p>and, after a brief search, he found the spot </p><p>where he had moored the boats. At his low </p><p>whistle, the others gathered round and </p><p>122 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>cautiously climbed in, Rala being lifted </p><p>aboard bodily by Valgard’s sturdy arms. </p><p> They muffled the oars with strips of</p><p>cloth and with infinite care to avoid splash- </p><p>ing or knocking, they rowed down-stream, </p><p>each oarsman taking his time from the man </p><p>before him. The fog was so thick that the </p><p>Northmen could not even see the lights </p><p>of the Cretan galley, so they knew that </p><p>they were quite safe from her for the </p><p>present. The current made their task </p><p>much lighter, and it was not long before </p><p>they floated out of the river-mouth into </p><p>the little bay. </p><p> Here arose a fresh difficulty. They might</p><p>row directly to their ship, which such ex- </p><p>perienced seamen had little doubt of find- </p><p>ing, even on such a night; but it would be </p><p>hard to rouse all hands, unship the long oars </p><p>and start the Gray Wolf up-river, without </p><p>alarming the coast-guard. It was most </p><p>likely, in this event, that the watchers in the </p><p>tower would suspect them of hostile designs </p><p>and alarm the entire city. </p><p> It would be wiser, decided Ragnarr, to ap-</p><p>proach the guard-tower boldly, call for </p><p>Kamas, and, presenting the letters which </p><p>Dardanus had given him, demand in the </p><p>king’s name to be allowed to take the Gray </p><p>Wolf up-river to the old city landing above </p><p>the fair-grounds. </p><p> Fortunately for Ragnarr, to whom the</p><p>courtly Babylonian script that was the regu- </p><p>lar diplomatic .medium of that day, was no </p><p>more than so many wedges of black on </p><p>white, the prudent Dardanus, in his desire </p><p>to avoid any specific action which the Cre- </p><p>tans might seize upon, had phrased the let- </p><p>ter of introduction in the most all-embrac- </p><p>ing general terms. At the sight of it, Kamas </p><p>saluted the king’s seal, gave the' desired per- </p><p>mission, and went back to his supper. Be- </p><p>fore the Trojan officer had finished his sec- </p><p>ond helping of broiled fish, the Gray Wolf, </p><p>with the small boats hoisted aboard, sweeps </p><p>muffled and arms served out, was moving </p><p>silently up the broad Scamander. </p><p> Ragnarr himself took the steering-oar, re-</p><p>joicing in the feel of the fog-damp on the </p><p>shaft, for he had been off the sea longer</p><p>than he liked. He steered by memory and </p><p>the feel of the current, for he could see no </p><p>further than the mast. </p><p> Presently a dim, high shape loomed up</p><p>off the port bow, and he swung the galley </p><p>so far to starboard that her bottom scraped </p><p>thrice on the shoaling sands. Three vague </p><p>blots of light starred the fog to port, and </p><p>the sounds of high-pitched, pleading voices </p><p>reached the Northmens’ ears. </p><p> Rala, standing at Ragnarr’s side, whis-</p><p>pered very softly: </p><p> “Master, they fear the fog, which is</p><p>thicker than it has been on these shores for </p><p>many years. They know it for a sign of the </p><p>sea-god’s anger, and they pray to him that </p><p>no harm may come of it.” </p><p> “It is our night,” answered Ragnarr.</p><p> They rowed on till he knew they had pass-</p><p>ed the next bend in the river, where the gal- </p><p>ley would be well hidden from below, even </p><p>in broad daylight, by the trees of the same </p><p>grove in which he had told Ilia of his love. </p><p>Bringing the Gray Wolf alongside the bank </p><p>and ordering the mast to be lowered, Rag- </p><p>narr quickly disembarked most of his crew </p><p>and ordered Rala to lead them to the city </p><p>wall and the entrance to the secret pas- </p><p>sage. </p><p> It was well hidden. A whole precious</p><p>hour was wasted in the search before they </p><p>found the opening, cunningly concealed </p><p>in the cleft between two great stones, </p><p>which Rala, owing to the darkness and </p><p>her haste, had failed to notice when she </p><p>emerged. </p><p> Through the narrow opening the North-</p><p>men crept, feeling their way along, till Val- </p><p>gard stopped them with an impatient growl. </p><p>From his pouch he drew a dry piece of soft- </p><p>wood, a blunted hardwood drill, a miniature </p><p>bow, and a handful of wood-dust and shav- </p><p>ings. Twirling the drill with the bow- </p><p>string, he soon had a smoking, glowing mass </p><p>in the notched center of the softwood piece, </p><p>and this he blew and fed with shavings till </p><p>fire burst forth. </p><p> Now fat pine torches were kindled, and,</p><p>as they illumined the way, strange sights</p><p>met the Northmen’s eyes. Scenes of bat- </p><p>tle, of the chase, and of worship covered the </p><p>stone walls of the tunnel in continuous </p><p>fresco. These were fresh-painted, for the </p><p>passage was new, as was shown by the heaps </p><p>of glistening stone-dust, chips, and even de- </p><p>fective blocks discarded by the builder and </p><p>not yet cleared away. </p><p> Presently the Northmen came to the</p><p>wide vault which Rala had noticed on the </p><p>way out; and now she plucked Ragnarr by </p><p>the sleeve. Halting his men with a gesture, </p><p>he looked up at the place to which she point- </p><p>ed in the ceiling of the tunnel, not six inches </p><p>above his own tall head. </p><p>In the Grip of the Minotaur </p><p>123 </p><p> First running his finger round the edge</p><p>of the stone to make sure it was free from </p><p>mortar, Ragnarr rested the palms of both </p><p>hands against it and lifted mightily. The </p><p>stone moved slightly, but settled again. </p><p>Once more he heaved, rising on the balls of </p><p>his feet and putting every ounce of strength </p><p>into the thrust. </p><p> The great block rose slowly, hung a mo-</p><p>ment, then rolled over on its side, leaving an </p><p>opening wide enough for a broad-shouldered </p><p>man to crawl through. Lifting himself </p><p>easily, Ragnarr took a swift glance at what </p><p>lay above and dropped back, looking well- </p><p>pleased. </p><p> “It is the Temple of the Mother,” he said</p><p>softly. “Follow me, you who left your wea- </p><p>pons here.” </p><p> They made their way to the altar where</p><p>Ragnarr counted off the stones till he came </p><p>to the one which he had seen Kamas press. </p><p>As he handled it, the stone swung inward </p><p>and there lay their good bronze weapons, </p><p>gleaming faintly in the dim light of the sin- </p><p>gle lamp that burned before the mighty fig- </p><p>ure of the goddess. </p><p> Swiftly the prince passed the swords and</p><p>axes one by one to their owners, till at last </p><p>every man in the company was armed. </p><p>Then they dropped back into the passage </p><p>and pressed on, neglecting to replace the </p><p>great stone. </p><p> On they hastened, up steep slopes and</p><p>around sharp corners, till the tunnel came </p><p>to a sudden end. Thrusting his massive </p><p>shoulder against the narrow closure, Rag- </p><p>narr lunged, his whole body back of the </p><p>blow, and fell prone as the door flew open. </p><p>Valgard, leaping out over the prostrate </p><p>Ragnarr, threw himself at something that </p><p>lay still on the pavement of the corridor. </p><p>Then he rose, wiping his fingers. </p><p> “Dead already,” he announced. “The</p><p>fool was asleep against the door and fell on </p><p>his own spear.” </p><p>CHAPTER VIII </p><p>THE SONG OF THE SWORD</p><p>*	I 'HE SIX stone lamps in the palace shrine</p><p>shone down on a solemn little com- </p><p>pany. Upon high thrones at opposite ends </p><p>of the room sat Dardanus and a thin little </p><p>old man with flowing robes and a long </p><p>white beard. This dignitary, the High </p><p>Priest of the Mother, wore about his neck </p><p>the symbol of his office, the twisted golden </p><p>chain of intertwining serpents. </p><p> Dardanus was clad in his most sumptuous</p><p>scarlet robes of state and wore a broad gold </p><p>band about his temples. His right hand </p><p>held an ivory scepter, tipped with a heavy </p><p>golden ball. </p><p> Midway between the thrones stood a low</p><p>altar, with crescent horns of consecration </p><p>attached to each of its four faces and touch- </p><p>ing at the tips. To the left of the altar and </p><p>facing the high priest stood Prince Ambro- </p><p>geos, with the Admiral Rhodonthos by his </p><p>side. To the right stood Ilia, clad all in </p><p>white, with a silver diadem upon her head. </p><p>Beside her was a sad-eyed matron, the Tro- </p><p>jan Queen, her face wearing the patient look </p><p>of one who has suffered much. </p><p> All semblance of happiness had vanished</p><p>from Ilia’s eyes. She was face to face with </p><p>her fate, and she knew not whether her lover </p><p>had escaped from his triumphant enemy. </p><p>Her brave spirit kept down any sign of the </p><p>terror that sickened her soul; she looked </p><p>upon her fate with unfaltering, queenlike </p><p>majesty. </p><p> The high priest rose, his feeble hands lift-</p><p>ed high above his head. At this sign, Dar- </p><p>danus came slowly to his feet, down the </p><p>three steps of his throne, and delivered to </p><p>the queen a chain of gold. Then he stood </p><p>motionless, facing the priest. The queen </p><p>turned, kissed the chain, and laid it about </p><p>Ilia’s neck; then, taking her daughter by the </p><p>hand, she led her to the altar. </p><p> Ambrogeos and Rhodonthos now bowed</p><p>their heads before the high priest, turned </p><p>and stepped to the altar, across whose </p><p>sacred horns Ambrogeos and Ilia joined </p><p>hands. Then the high priest began to in- </p><p>tone the Chant of the Mother, and as he </p><p>sang the first stave in his quavering falsetto, </p><p>two lines of priests marched in through the </p><p>wide doorway, chanting the Marriage</p><p>Hymn. </p><p>“O Thou, Who all things quickenest, </p><p>Who givest life to all that dwell on earth, </p><p>Descend from thy thrice holy seat, </p><p>To bless and fructify this wedded pair; </p><p>Hallow their love and guide their steps, </p><p>Through life to life, life-giving, all their days, </p><p>Till, lost to earth, from earth released, </p><p>In Thee they blend again, in changeless wedlock </p><p> live.”</p><p> The song ceased; and swiftly, in strange</p><p>and wild antiphony, there rose a ringing </p><p>voice: </p><p>124 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>“Tyr! </p><p> While blade cleaves to handle,</p><p> While blood dyes the edges,</p><p> While gray sword slayeth,</p><p> And gray wolf devoureth,</p><p> His fame shall soar upward</p><p> As soars the swift eagle,</p><p> The ravening war-bird,</p><p> Who rendelh his foemen.</p><p>Tyr!” </p><p> All stood, staring in petrified wonder.</p><p>Between the ranks of frightened priests a </p><p>towering figure strode, eyes blazing under </p><p>the bronze helmet, the right hand clutching </p><p>a great, naked sword, whose hard gray </p><p>edges flashed in the lamplight like flickering </p><p>fire. </p><p> It was Ragnarr, and behind him trooped</p><p>rank on rank of armed and stern-eyed men. </p><p>Among the first swaggered Hjalti the Bard, </p><p>whose tongue had been loosed by the sing- </p><p>ing of the priests. Ragnarr strode to the </p><p>altar, with eyes only for Ilia, who rushed to </p><p>him with a glad cry. </p><p> Ambrogeos turned pale, but less from</p><p>fright than fury. He stood for a moment, </p><p>clutching at the place where his sword-hilt </p><p>would have been, then, seizing the heavy </p><p>scepter from the king’s hand, he struck at </p><p>Ragnarr with all his might. </p><p> Valgard sprang in, his mighty ax circling</p><p>round his head; but before he could strike, </p><p>Ragnarr thrust Ilia into the old warrior’s </p><p>arms, and the gray sword descended to </p><p>meet the white staff. It cut the tough ivory </p><p>handle into two pieces, and, turning, struck </p><p>the Cretan an awful, though a glancing </p><p>blow, full on the head. Ambrogeos fell, his </p><p>blood streaming from the wound. The </p><p>Northmen raised their crashing battle-cry </p><p>of “Tyr!” </p><p> Now were heard the jingling clank of ac-</p><p>coutrements and the running of many feet, </p><p>and through the doorway poured a detach- </p><p>ment of the royal guard. The soldiers </p><p>halted in amazement at the scene, but grim </p><p>old Rhodonthos cried: </p><p> “Warriors, avenge the slaughter of your</p><p>monarch’s guest! Strike these bold mur- </p><p>derers down!” </p><p> But the soldiers hesitated, for between</p><p>them and their king stood the stern North- </p><p>men, swords and axes raised, while high </p><p>above the cowering Dardanus towered the </p><p>mighty Valgard, his ax poised above the </p><p>king’s head. </p><p> “Stir and I strike!” he shouted.</p><p> Ragnarr stood over the smitten Ambro-</p><p>geos, his threatening eyes and dripping </p><p>sword striking terror to the Trojans’ hearts. </p><p> “O king!” he cried, pointing to the</p><p>guardsmen. “It is not seemly that all these </p><p>should hear the words we have to speak to- </p><p>gether. Is it your will—as it is mine—that </p><p>all these should go?” </p><p> The soldiers stood irresolute, but the</p><p>king, his tongue loosened by the sight of </p><p>the cruel ax that hovered longingly above </p><p>him, bade them withdraw. Priests and sol- </p><p>diery filed slowly out, their faces blank and </p><p>staring. After them strode the Admiral </p><p>Rhodonthos, his fierce eyes hot with hatred. </p><p> Again Ilia came to Ragnarr’s arms.</p><p> “You have done what none in Troy was</p><p>brave enough to do,” she said in tones vi- </p><p>brant with triumphant love. “But I fear </p><p>greatly lest this very deed bring death to </p><p>you and to all of us that are here. If that </p><p>befall, then I shall die as I have lived, lov- </p><p>ing you. Now shall I go also, or is it right </p><p>for me to hear what you and my father have </p><p>to say to each other?” </p><p> “You shall stay,” answered Ragnarr.</p><p>“Valgard, look to my bride while I have </p><p>speech with my father here.” </p><p> Putting up his ax and descending from</p><p>the dais, the old warrior drew the girl aside, </p><p>while all stood silent, waiting for the storm </p><p>to burst.</p><p> Dardanus shifted his gaze uneasily under</p><p>the Northman’s piercing eyes. His hands </p><p>opened and closed nervously, and he swal- </p><p>lowed once or twice to ease.the dryness of </p><p>his throat. Suddenly he could endure it no </p><p>longer. Terrified, conscious of guilt as he </p><p>was, some spark of his youthful fire came </p><p>back to him, as the contemptuous glance of </p><p>the young man roused anger in his heart, </p><p>and resentment at the violation of his </p><p>hearth. </p><p> “You rash young fool!” he shrilled,</p><p>stamping his foot. “Was it not enough that </p><p>your ill-omened presence in my land brought </p><p>Crete about my ears? Must you now com- </p><p>plete my ruin? Think you that Minos will </p><p>not take vengeance for this murderous deed? </p><p>Aye, and a bloody vengeance! Well will it </p><p>be if one of us survive to tell the tale of the </p><p>sea-king’s sacrifice to the ghost of his first- </p><p>born!” </p><p> “Peace!” interrupted Ragnarr. “Is there</p><p>aught, old trembler, that you fear more </p><p>than death? I have done no more than </p><p>my right: I have slain or grievously wound- </p><p>ed the man who thought to rob me; I have </p><p>In the Grip of the Minotaur </p><p>125 </p><p>won my bride with my sword-hand, and </p><p>have forced her perjured father to treat with </p><p>me in the open, where lies and broken </p><p>promises will not avail him. </p><p> “I have braved a people in arms with a</p><p>few men and have declared war on my ene- </p><p>mies and yours. As for this lump of flesh—” </p><p>and he touched the prone Ambrogeos with </p><p>his foot—“it is no use to raise an outcry </p><p>over him. If he is not slain outright, it mat- </p><p>ters not. When the sword Tyrfing sets her </p><p>teeth in a man, he is doomed. Speak of </p><p>what counts: what do you propose to do? </p><p>Stay here and wait for the coming of this </p><p>Minos, or flee?” </p><p> Dardanus trembled with rage.</p><p> “Thrice-accursed barbarian!” he scream-</p><p>ed. “You bring death upon me and ask if I </p><p>mean to take it standing or running! Oh, </p><p>if my frame had the vigor of youth once </p><p>more, and I were armed! One thing I can </p><p>do, Wolf of the Waters: the compact be- </p><p>tween us is no more—I stamp upon it. My </p><p>daughter shall never be yours in this life, </p><p>unless you add robbery to murder and tear </p><p>her from her helpless father’s arms. If you </p><p>dare do that, my curse upon you both! </p><p>Now go to your ship, hoist your abhorred </p><p>sail, and lift the ban of the gods from my </p><p>shores!” </p><p> Now Ragnarr’s ears caught the tramp of</p><p>booted feet, and Rhodonthos stood in the </p><p>doorway, with four armed Cretans behind </p><p>him. </p><p> “Is it the slayer’s will that we bear his vic-</p><p>tim’s body hence?” he asked in even tones. </p><p> The Northmen raised their shields and</p><p>drew together, save Ragnarr, who advanced </p><p>and spoke with grim courtesy. </p><p> “Sea-thief, I will not deny the boon a</p><p>brave man asks. Take your lord, and may </p><p>we meet again.” </p><p> “May I live to see that day,” replied the</p><p>Cretan earnestly. </p><p> He signed to his men who entered, picked</p><p>up the prostrate and unmoving Ambrogeos</p><p>and bore him away on a framework of </p><p>spears. At the doorway Rhodonthos paused </p><p>and looked back till his eyes met those of </p><p>Dardanus. </p><p> “Dog of Minos!” he hissed. “We go now,</p><p>but we shall return to levy such a tribute as </p><p>will bring wailing into every house in Troy, </p><p>and spread a royal banquet for the Mino- </p><p>taur!” </p><p> Valgard, who stood by Ilia’s side, bent</p><p>over the princess and said softly: </p><p> “When we leave this place, we go straight</p><p>to our ship. The tide will be at the flood in </p><p>two hours more. If you are bold enough, </p><p>come through the passage to the grove on </p><p>the river’s bank, by the southwest gate. </p><p>We will wait for you. He does not know.” </p><p> “I will come,” she answered simply.</p><p> Ragnarr looked almost pityingly at the</p><p>poor old king who had fallen to his knees, </p><p>his face as yellowy-white as his cloven scep- </p><p>ter. </p><p> “After all,” said the Northman, “it is I</p><p>who have brought this evil upon you, and </p><p>none but I should bear what comes of it. </p><p>What tribute is it the sea-thief speaks of, </p><p>and what manner of monster is this Mino- </p><p>taur?” </p><p> “How should I know?” Dardanus groan-</p><p>ed wearily. “They who have seen him have </p><p>not lived to tell of it. Every year, Crete has </p><p>wrung from us a tribute of twenty youths </p><p>and twenty maidens for this Minotaur, and </p><p>none has ever looked upon their faces again. </p><p>It is said, and all men believe it, that he is a </p><p>fearful monster who devours them living. </p><p>Now Minos will have a life from every </p><p>household for this deed, and we are fortu- </p><p>nate if he asks no more. Oh, that I have </p><p>lived to see this day!” </p><p> Ragnarr raised gray Tyrfing above his</p><p>head and shook it in his mighty grip. </p><p> “By this sword,” he swore, “and by Tyr,</p><p>the god of my house, this is my task, and I </p><p>take it upon myself! I will sail to this </p><p>island of Crete, give myself up to meet this </p><p>Minotaur who fattens on innocent blood, </p><p>and slay him in single combat! Then, O</p><p>Dardanus, I will return and claim my </p><p>bride!” </p><p>TO BE CONTINUED </p><p> *yi' WAS Sunday. The skidders,</p><p>I the log-loaders, the geared loco- </p><p>IjA motives, the ax and the saw of </p><p>CSSmS the woodsmen were silent; over </p><p>the mountains lay the soft blue haze that </p><p>somehow hallows all the days of September </p><p>and October. </p><p> The midday meal was over, and most of</p><p>the lumberjacks, clad in their best, lounged </p><p>here and there on the big, rough boarding- </p><p>house porches; some of them bullied their </p><p>friends good-naturedly, others told funny </p><p>stories; all of them were smoking. Moun- </p><p>taineers they were, nine out of every ten </p><p>of them, stalwart, sunburned, big-hearted </p><p>sons of the hills. </p><p> Suddenly one of them that was not a</p><p>mountaineer, a heavily built man under </p><p>thirty, who never alluded to his past any </p><p>more than if he had had no past what- </p><p>ever, rose and went upstairs and to his un- </p><p>plastered, unceiled, ‘unpapered room, where </p><p>even the bedframe was made of rough </p><p>boards. </p><p> He halted just inside. A strapping young</p><p>fellow in cheap blue serge turned from a </p><p>small mirror that hung on the opposite wall; </p><p>he had been giving his thick black hair a </p><p>careful combing. When he saw his room- </p><p>mate, he reddened a little. </p><p> “Hello, Marvin,” he drawled in the drawl</p><p>of the hills—he was a hill man. </p><p> Marvin Blair laughed, and sat down heav-</p><p>ily on their cheap bed. </p><p> “All togged up to go to see old Henry</p><p>Larrimore’s girl!” he said briskly. </p><p> “It ain’t a criminal offense, is it?” smiled</p><p>the mountaineer. </p><p> “I guess not,” laughed Blair. “Fact is,</p><p>I meant to go to see her myself this after- </p><p>noon.” </p><p> Tom Harman looked thoughtful and</p><p>somewhat perplexed. They had been pretty </p><p>good friends, he and Marvin Blair; and now </p><p>—now was a woman coming between them? </p><p> “Well,” he said finally, “I ain’t got no</p><p>mortgage on her. You’ve got as good a </p><p>right to go to see her as me, I reckon. We </p><p>shore won’t fall out over Bess, Marvin.</p><p>But we oughtn’t to both go to see her at the </p><p>same time. S’pose we pitch heads and tails </p><p>and see who goes and who don’t go?” </p><p> Blair nodded.</p><p> “Heads you go, tails I go.”</p><p> The mountaineer took a small coin from</p><p>his pocket and tossed it almost to the raf- </p><p>ters. It fell heads up. </p><p> “Lucky boy!” said Marvin Blair, shrug-</p><p>ging his shoulders. </p><p> Tom Harman stole down by way of the</p><p>back stairway to avoid a ragging, and hur- </p><p>ried off through the woodland. From a </p><p>window Marvin Blair watched him go with </p><p>a strange light in his eyes. More than one </p><p>pair of good friends have been brought to </p><p>swords’ points by a woman. </p><p> Old Henry Larrimore lived a mile away</p><p>in a rambling log cabin at the head of a </p><p>A Woman Keeps a Secret </p><p>127 </p><p>cove. The guttered path that led from the </p><p>weather-beaten gate to the front porch was </p><p>lined with frost-bitten marigolds and pretty- </p><p>by-nights. </p><p> Old Henry sat in a home-made chair in</p><p>the doorway, and he held an open Bible </p><p>in his hand. Beside his chair lay a spotted </p><p>hound with its tongue lolling out. </p><p> Tom Harman stopped at the stone step,</p><p>straightened the collar of his blue cham- </p><p>bray sliirt, jerked at his tie and uttered a </p><p>greeting. </p><p> Larrimore looked up.</p><p> “Hi, Tom. How d’ye come on? Take</p><p>’at chair thar on the porch. Fine day. </p><p>Been to dinner, I reckon? Set down then.” </p><p> Tom sat down and patted the hound’s</p><p>head. Most dogs made friends easily with </p><p>Tom Harman, and children liked him; and </p><p>this is eulogy. </p><p> “Whar’s Bess at?” he asked awkwardly.</p><p> “Bess?” Old Henry bit off a chew of</p><p>twisted brown tobacco. “I don’ know. </p><p>’At was shore a fine little rifle ye bought for </p><p>Bess, Tom; but I’m afeard ye laid out too </p><p>much money on it. Blast my eyes, Tom </p><p>Harman, ef she cain’t beat me a-shootin’ </p><p>with it! She vows ef ever us and them thar </p><p>low-down Fallses gits to fightin’ ag’in she’s </p><p>a-goin’ to he’p! Good stuff in that gyurl, </p><p>Tom. And it now looks like the’d be more </p><p>trouble atwixt us and the Fallses. Joe </p><p>Falls he’s been a-carryin’ talk around putty </p><p>sharp. </p><p> “Bess hates Joe. By gar! She turns as</p><p>white as a ghost when she even hears his </p><p>name spoke. As you know, Tommy, we </p><p>alius thought it was Joe Falls ’at killed my </p><p>boy George—pore George! He was the </p><p>finest boy in the world. Twin brother to </p><p>Bess, he was—thar’s Bess now. Down at </p><p>the spring in the lorrels. She run, I reckon, </p><p>when she seed you a-comin’. The mink!” </p><p> With a long arm he pointed.</p><p> Harman patted the hound’s head again,</p><p>rose, and went down to the spring where he </p><p>found a slender young woman who was, in </p><p>all truth, a nymph of the woods—an unedu- </p><p>cated, primitive young woman. She was </p><p>barefooted and bareheaded, and her chest- </p><p>nut-brown hair was caught at the back of </p><p>her neck with a faded blue ribbon; her eyes </p><p>were brown too; her mouth was sweet and </p><p>mischievous, very mischievous. She smiled </p><p>saucily at Tom Harman. </p><p> “Hi, Bess,” he greeted her.</p><p> “ ’Lo, Tom,” she replied.</p><p> They sat down on a moss-covered stone</p><p>there by the spring, in the shade of a great, </p><p>cool green hemlock tree. Tom broke off a </p><p>fern and began to strip the leaves from the </p><p>stem. He spoke slowly, even for him, when </p><p>he spoke. </p><p> “Bess,” he said, “I love ye, and I’ve come</p><p>to ax ye to marry me and jine yore forchunes </p><p>with mine, and be my wife. What’s the </p><p>verdict?” </p><p> “Why—I thought you hated all</p><p>wimmin!” laughed Bess. </p><p> Tom frowned hard. His gaze absently</p><p>followed a bee-martin that was chasing a </p><p>bee. </p><p> “I did say I did,” he muttered, “ a long</p><p>time ago. Five year ago, it was. I imagined </p><p>I	was in love with Julie Flint, over on</p><p>Grandpap Mountain. I wasn’t but jest </p><p>eighteen then, and a fool. I sold mydawg </p><p>and my banjo to buy her a ’gagement ring </p><p>—and she went and told it and laughed </p><p>about it. Told it fust, and ’en laughed about </p><p>it! A woman jest cain’t keep a secret. It’s </p><p>onpossible for a woman to keep a secret!” </p><p>He had spoken with a great deal of spirit. </p><p>It was the spirit of the hill pride, the finest </p><p>and yet the most unreasoning pride on </p><p>earth. But Bess misunderstood. If he didn’t </p><p>still love the Grandpap Mountain girl why </p><p>was he so worked up? </p><p> “Here’s a woman ’at can keep a secret,</p><p>Tom,” she said spicily. “I’m a-keepin’ a </p><p>secret now. It’s a big secret, too, Tom Har- </p><p>man. It’s so big, ef I was to tell you, you— </p><p>you’d shore jump!” </p><p> “Tell me,” begged Tom. “I won’t never</p><p>tell; hope to die and go to the devil the next </p><p>minute ef I do.” </p><p> “No,” said Bess. “I’m a-goin’ to show</p><p>you that a woman can keep a secret.” </p><p>Tom spent ten precious minutes in plead- </p><p>ing. She refused stoutly to tell. </p><p> “I bet I know,” he muttered. “You’re</p><p>a-goin’ to marry Marvin Blair.” </p><p> “Am I?” she said. “Am I?” she went on.</p><p>“Why don’t you quit loggin’ for a livin’, </p><p>Tom, and go to tellin’ forchunes?” </p><p> “Well,” smiled the mountaineer, “you</p><p>hain’t answered my question yit. Will ye </p><p>marry me, Bess?” </p><p> “No,” flatly. “No, I won’t. Go over to</p><p>Grandpap Mountain and marry Julie Flint. </p><p>Good-by, Tom, and luck be with ye when </p><p>ye go atter Julie!” </p><p> She rose and ran from him. He watched</p><p>her go with fire in his eyes. He loved her </p><p>128 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>madly, as he had never loved the perfidious </p><p>Julie Flint. Slowly he made his way back </p><p>to the logging-camp’s boarding-house. </p><p>THE other lumberjacks were stand- </p><p>ing in somber little groups here and </p><p>there on the porches when he ar- </p><p>rived. Something out of the ordinary had </p><p>taken place, he knew. Then Marvin Blair </p><p>beckoned to him and they went upstairs- </p><p>together. </p><p> When they were in their room Blair closed</p><p>the door and turned to Harman. Blair’s </p><p>face was pale and anxious. </p><p> “I didn’t mean to tell even you, Tom,”</p><p>began Blair. “But now I think I’d better. </p><p>They’ve sent for an officer, and he’ll be here </p><p>any minute. Tom, Joe Falls is downstairs, </p><p>dead. They brought him in from Mad Dog </p><p>Creek, a few minutes after you left for </p><p>Henry Larrimore’s. He had been dead for </p><p>several hours. The gun that killed him was </p><p>a small-bored rifle. The only small-bored </p><p>rifle in this whole section is the one you </p><p>gave Bess. Bess hated Joe like poison </p><p>because she thought he killed her twin </p><p>brother. Now do you see where she </p><p>stands?” </p><p> “The devil!” cried the hill man smoth-</p><p>eredly. “But she never done it—did she, </p><p>Marvin?” </p><p> Blair looked behind him.</p><p> “Yes,” he whispered, “she did it. I saw</p><p>her do it.” </p><p> Harman’s big hands clenched hard.</p><p> “See here, Blair,” he growled, his voice</p><p>throbbing, “you ain’t a-lyin’ about her, are </p><p>you?” </p><p> “Lying about her!” Blair was white.</p><p>“Tom, I love Bess as much as you do! I </p><p>was on my way to see her this morning, and </p><p>just before I reached Mad Dog Creek I saw </p><p>Joe Falls in the woods ahead of me. Then I </p><p>heard a rifle-shot and I saw Joe crumple </p><p>like a wet rag and pitch forward with his </p><p>face in the leaves. I looked toward the little </p><p>cloud of powder smoke and there stood Bess</p><p>Larrimore, with the little rifle you gave her </p><p>in her hands! I hurried back here to tell </p><p>you. Then I decided I wouldn’t tell any- </p><p>body. But the size of the bullet will cause </p><p>her arrest—that and the fact that she hated </p><p>Joe so much; and when her trial comes off </p><p>she won’t stand for the grilling of the pros- </p><p>ecuting attorney, and her very nerve will </p><p>give her away!” </p><p> Through Harman’s brain there flashed</p><p>something Bess had said to him less than an </p><p>hour before: “I’m keepin’ a secret now. </p><p>It’s a big secret, too.” So the killing of the </p><p>man who she believed had killed the </p><p>brother she had loved more than life, that </p><p>was her big secret! That poor little hot- </p><p>headed, fiery-souled child! He regretted </p><p>that he had given her the rifle. </p><p> Blair continued in tones that were low</p><p>and tense: </p><p> “Even if the Larrimores prove that Joe</p><p>Falls killed the son of Old Henry, it won’t </p><p>clear the girl. And it’s up to you and me to </p><p>save her, Tpm, my friend. One of us must </p><p>make a sacrifice for this girl we both love. </p><p>Either of us is big enough to do it. We </p><p>would have a chance of escape, but Bess </p><p>wouldn’t. Don’t you see, Tom? Well, are </p><p>you game?” </p><p> “Am I game!” muttered the mountaineer,</p><p>inclined toward feeling insulted at being </p><p>asked. “Marvin, my middle name is game. </p><p>How’ll we decide which one of us is to make </p><p>the sacrifice?” </p><p> Blair took a coin from his pocket. It was</p><p>a copper cent. </p><p> “Tails it’s you,” he whispered, “and heads</p><p>it’s me. Is that all right?” </p><p> “Pitch it!” said Tom.</p><p> Blair flipped the coin to the rafters; it</p><p>spun in the air, over and over, and fell with </p><p>a slight tinkle. The two men bent forward </p><p>anxiously. </p><p> “It’s up to me,” said Harman, straighten-</p><p>ing; and he said it without regret, like a </p><p>man. </p><p> They shook hands silently, and then they</p><p>went downstairs. </p><p>II </p><p>FIFTEEN minutes later Harman </p><p>walked into the room where all that </p><p>was left of Joe Falls lay under an </p><p>old quilted coverlet. The room was </p><p>crowded. </p><p> Harman forced his way to where a tall</p><p>and lean, bearded man bent over the silent </p><p>figure. The lean, bearded man was a </p><p>deputy sheriff, and he had only that minute </p><p>arrived. </p><p> “Does anybody here know who killed this</p><p>man?” he asked quietly, his shaggy brows </p><p>drawn above his alert gray eyes. </p><p> “I done it,” said Tom Harman, putting</p><p>out his wrists for the irons. </p><p> Now Bill Hines knew Harman, and he</p><p>A Woman Keeps a Secret </p><p>129 </p><p>knew that Harman had a reputation as a </p><p>good, fair fighter. </p><p> “It seems to me you was hasty, Tom,”</p><p>slowly. “You could ha’ broke Joe Falls </p><p>over your knee and saved gunpowder. </p><p>What made you do it, Tom?” </p><p> “I reckon I’ll carry my little bit o’ talk</p><p>to the trile jedge, Bill,” drawled Harman. </p><p>“Ef you’re ready to go, I am.” </p><p> The deputy ironed the mountaineer, and</p><p>drew his revolver, not that he thought he </p><p>might need it for Harman, but because there </p><p>was danger of the dead man’s relatives </p><p>making a violent demonstration. Hines took </p><p>the prisoner out to where his horse stood </p><p>hitched to a little cedar, and mounted. </p><p>Then, with Harman walking briskly in the </p><p>road ahead of him he started for a town in </p><p>the lowlands. </p><p> Not for one second had the mountaineer</p><p>meant to face a trial in the courthouse at </p><p>Johnsboro; nor did he mean to allow himself </p><p>to be even locked up in the Johnsboro jail. </p><p>He was fully determined that he would es- </p><p>cape from Hines before they reached the </p><p>lowlands. But he had a little talking to do </p><p>before he made his escape, and he proceed- </p><p>ed to it. </p><p> “Bill,” he said over his shoulder, “ef</p><p>you’ve threatened to kill me on sight, and I </p><p>shoot you down the fust time we meet, can </p><p>I be sent up for that?” </p><p> Hines answered—“Not if you can prove</p><p>that I threatened to kill you on sight.” </p><p>Harman stopped as suddenly as if he had </p><p>been struck. He acted well, indeed. </p><p> “The devil!” he cried as if greatly cha-</p><p>grined. “Bill Hines, I hain’t got no wit- </p><p>nesses to prove it by!” </p><p> “Looks bad. Let’s go on, Tom,” said</p><p>Hines. </p><p> He seemed more watchful than before.</p><p>He kept his hand close to the butt of his </p><p>revolver now. Bill Hines had an oath to </p><p>keep, and he meant to keep it. Had the </p><p>prisoner been his own mother’s son it would</p><p>have made no difference. </p><p> But Harman had to escape. He was like</p><p>the rabbit that climbed a tree. Over and </p><p>over in his mind he turned this plan and </p><p>that. He thought of leaping from a cliff </p><p>the road ran on and hiding himself, all but </p><p>his nose, in a pool of the creek below; he </p><p>thought of frightening Hines’s horse and </p><p>making a quick dive into the thick laurels— </p><p>and half a dozen other things—but none of </p><p>these methods promised enough. </p><p>9 </p><p> Hines was accustomed to tricks. Hines</p><p>himself was a fox. Harman did not fall </p><p>upon an idea that thoroughly pleased him </p><p>until they had covered several miles. </p><p> How small the things that sometimes de-</p><p>cide human destinies! Twice that day al- </p><p>ready the tide of Tom Harman’s life had </p><p>been turned by the mere tossing of a coin. </p><p>And still another turn was at hand. This </p><p>time it was so little a thing as the sight of a </p><p>gray squirrel that ran along on the ground, </p><p>whisking its bushy tail and making a noise </p><p>something like the quacking of a young </p><p>duck. </p><p> It was in the squirrel-shooting season.</p><p>Had it not been the Seventh Day, the woods </p><p>would have rung with the echoes of the </p><p>hunter’s rifle. As it was, Harman had </p><p>heard only one shot; generally speaking, </p><p>the hillfolk remember the Sabbath. </p><p> Suddenly Harman stopped and faced</p><p>about. </p><p> “A word with ye, Bill,” he said, and he</p><p>seemed badly frightened. “Them Fallses </p><p>will take a shot at me as shore as the devil’s </p><p>bad as soon as we git in them thick hick’ry </p><p>woods ahead thar. I want to ax ye, Bill, to </p><p>keep both o’ yore eyes wide open for a </p><p>Falls with a rifle. I hain’t in a fix to defend </p><p>myself now.” </p><p> Hines seemed impressed.</p><p> “I’ve been thinking of that,” he growled.</p><p> Another mile they made. They had al-</p><p>most passed through a long stretch of gold- </p><p>en-yellow hickories when from the moun- </p><p>tainside above and to the right there came</p><p>the keen thunder of a rifle, and Tom Har- </p><p>man wheeled and crumpled and fell on his </p><p>face in the dust of the road. He moaned </p><p>and turned on his back, and Bill Hines saw </p><p>a red splotch on his blue chambray shirt </p><p>squarely over his heart. </p><p> “I told you—to watch for a Falls—you</p><p>tin-can officer,” he muttered disconnectedly, </p><p>gasping, writhing. </p><p> When a man is shot straight through the</p><p>heart there is no chance for him to live. </p><p>Bill Hines swore a loud oath, spurred his </p><p>horse and rode, his revolver ready in his </p><p>hand, into the hickories. A moment later </p><p>he surprised a bare-headed and freckled </p><p>youth in the act of ramming a round bullet </p><p>into the barrel of an old muzzle-loader. </p><p> “You’ll shoot a man I’ve got arrested,</p><p>will you!” cried Hines. “Hands up, you— </p><p>quick!” </p><p> The boy smiled good-naturedly.</p><p>130 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “You’ve treed the wrong ’coon, mister,”</p><p>he drawled. “I shot a squirrel. Thar it </p><p>is.” </p><p> He pointed to a gray-tail lying on the</p><p>leaves. Light broke to Bill Hines, the fox. </p><p>He rode at a breakneck pace back to where </p><p>he had left Tom Harman for dead. Har- </p><p>man was gone. </p><p> “I knowed,” said Harman to the friend</p><p>who, with a hammer and an ax, broke the </p><p>irons from his wrists late that night, “that </p><p>the’d shorely be a hunter in them hick’ries, </p><p>Sunday or no Sunday. So I gethered me a </p><p>handful o’ pokeberries from the side o’ the </p><p>road to make blood, and took the resk. </p><p>And so now it’s me for Kaintucky. So long. </p><p>Much obliged, and good luck!” </p><p> The night and the laurels swallowed him.</p><p>THERE were no logging-camps in </p><p>that section of the Blue Grass State </p><p>to which Tom Harman went. Un- </p><p>der a high-sounding name he hired himself </p><p>to a wealthy horse-breeder; and the horse- </p><p>breeder liked him, paid him good money for </p><p>his work and asked no questions. </p><p> For nearly three years he tried to be con-</p><p>tented with the idea that he had sacrificed </p><p>home and friends and his heart’s desire in a </p><p>worthy cause. Then he began to think </p><p>backward frequently, of Bess and his moth- </p><p>er, and the blooming laurels on Black Pine </p><p>Mountain, and the call came; the longing </p><p>was too great to be thrown down. </p><p> He wore a nicely pointed young black</p><p>beard now, and he was of the opinion that </p><p>even his own brother would have difficulty </p><p>in recognizing him. So he decided that he </p><p>would just slip back home and see Bess again </p><p>and his people, and his good friend, Marvin </p><p>Blair, then slip back to . Kentucky without </p><p>the law’s being any the wiser. And perhaps </p><p>—perhaps he would bring Bess back with </p><p>him as his wife. He believed she loved him. </p><p>And if she did love him, could she refuse to </p><p>marry him after what he had done for her? </p><p> Back to Tennessee’s dim blue hills went</p><p>Tom Harman, and he walked the last hun- </p><p>dred miles of the journey because he did not</p><p>like to run the risk of meeting the fox, Bill </p><p>Hines. </p><p> At noon of a day toward the last of July</p><p>he reached the crest of long, low Black Pine </p><p>Mountain and sat himself down on a stone </p><p>to rest. Spread out before him, beautiful </p><p>in the waxen white of the laurel bloom, was </p><p>his beloved home country. The old logging- </p><p>camp was still there, but a great deal of the </p><p>timber, of course, was gone. </p><p> From where he sat he could see neither</p><p>his father’s nor old Henry Larrimore’s cab- </p><p>in; so he gave his attention wholly to his old </p><p>friends, the sputtering locomotive, the thun- </p><p>dering skidders, and the long-armed log- </p><p>loader. </p><p> For half an hour he sat there and watched</p><p>it; then he rose and went rapidly down the </p><p>mountainside to shake the right hand of </p><p>Marvin Blair, if he was still there; and Har- </p><p>man hoped he was. Blair, of course, </p><p>wouldn’t tell; and when he had seen his old </p><p>friend he would go over to see Bess. </p><p> He found Blair easily. Blair was giving</p><p>orders to a pair of cutters—he now held a </p><p>foreman’s place—and that was good. Har- </p><p>man was very glad of that. </p><p> Harman stepped out of the blooming</p><p>laurels and confronted his old partner. </p><p> “Marvin, do you know me?” he cried</p><p>happily. </p><p> “Not from a side of sole-leather,” said</p><p>Blair, halting abruptly. </p><p> “Tom!” smiled the mountaineer.</p><p> “Harman!” exclaimed Blair. “How’re</p><p>you, Tom?” </p><p> “Keen as a mink!” They shook hands.</p><p>“How’s Bess Larrimore, Marvin?” </p><p> “All right,” said Blair. He went on nerv-</p><p>ously: “Say, Bill Hines has haunted this </p><p>place almost daily since you got away from </p><p>him. He feels that his honor will never be </p><p>made whole until he gets you—you know </p><p>how he is, Tom. And he’d know you </p><p>through your beard. He’d know you if </p><p>you had a bear’s face on you! Better sneak</p><p>over to your father’s and hide there, and </p><p>do it quick. I’ll be over tonight to see you, </p><p>and I’ll tell Bess you’re here. Be careful! </p><p>Hines holds out that you will be caught if it </p><p>takes the rest of his life.” </p><p> “All right,” said Harman, and he dove</p><p>into the thick laurels. </p><p> Almost on a line between him and his</p><p>father’s cabin was the cabin of old Henry </p><p>Larrimore, and the temptation to stop and </p><p>see Bess for one little minute became strong. </p><p>He yielded to it and went creeping up to the </p><p>spring under the giant hemlock. Bess was </p><p>nowhere in sight, and he went on to the </p><p>house. A gray-nosed old hound came to the </p><p>weather-beaten gate to meet him, and he </p><p>gave it a friendly pat on the head. Then he </p><p>hallooed softly. </p><p> Bess came to the door. He saw that she</p><p>A Woman Keeps a Secret	131</p><p>was a full-grown woman now, mature and </p><p>roundish. She wore her hair up, and she </p><p>wore shoes and stockings, and skirts of blue </p><p>percale reached to her ankles. It was evi- </p><p>dent that she did not know him. Forgetting </p><p>all about Bill Hines, he acted upon a mis- </p><p>chievous impulse and said to her: </p><p> “I’m a travelin’ fortune-teller, kind lady,</p><p>and all I charge for a full life readin’ is the </p><p>pitiful sum of ten cents. Your money back </p><p>if you’re not satisfied.” </p><p> It came smoothly enough. Nearly three</p><p>years of association with Kentucky horse- </p><p>men had taken away much of his native </p><p>dialect. </p><p> “Come in and have a chair on the porch,”</p><p>said Bess with a vague unhappiness in her </p><p>voice. “I’ll bring out the money.” </p><p> Harman went to the porch and sat down.</p><p>He drew the rim of his broad black hat low </p><p>over his eyes to prevent her from recogniz- </p><p>ing him. She came out, gave him a nickel </p><p>and five pennies and sat down in a chair </p><p>facing him. He put the money into his </p><p>pocket and reached for her hand. </p><p> “A man who loves you is not far away,”</p><p>he began in a monotone, staring intently at </p><p>her palm. “He has come back here to ask </p><p>you to marry him. He couldn’t think of </p><p>anything but you in the daytime, nor dream </p><p>of anything but you at night, up in Ken- </p><p>tucky. He loves you more than life; and if </p><p>you love him the devil hisself cain’t keep </p><p>you two apart. If you-” </p><p> The young woman tore her hand from his</p><p>and went to her feet. She knew him now, </p><p>even through his beard. </p><p> “Tom!” she cried broken-heartedly, and</p><p>there was all the grim tragedy and suffering </p><p>of death in her brown eyes. “Tom! You’ve </p><p>come back for me, and I—I’ve done went </p><p>and married myself to a man I hate!” </p><p>“Married!” </p><p> Harman, too, went to his feet. His face</p><p>was chalky white, and he looked at her with </p><p>stern and bitter reproach. </p><p> “Two months ago,” she said. “To Mar-</p><p>vin Blair.” </p><p>Ill </p><p>Iffl SHE bent her head, crushed, bro- </p><p>pPhj ken. He stood over her, primitive, </p><p>strong and terrible. And yet, he </p><p>tried to reason with himself. She had never </p><p>promised to be his wife. Still- </p><p>“What made you marry him?” he asked, </p><p>and his voice was pinched down so much </p><p>that the woman thought he was speaking </p><p>gently. </p><p> “I didn’t think I’d ever see you any</p><p>more,” she answered weakly and hopelessly. </p><p>“My father and mother died after you left. </p><p>I wanted a home of my own. I decided I’d </p><p>as well marry Marvin as anybody else, or </p><p>better, acause he was yore best friend, I </p><p>understood. But I soon hated him. He’s </p><p>mean to me. He’s a brute. Marvin Blair’s </p><p>a brute! To look at him and to hear him </p><p>talk, you’d think he was a saint. But he </p><p>ain’t. He’s oily. Tom, he fooled you; he </p><p>cain’t be no friend to anybody!” ' </p><p> “Yes, I reckon he fooled me,” agreed</p><p>Harman. “But he won’t never fool me no </p><p>more. And he won’t never treat you mean </p><p>no more. I run away the other time to save </p><p>you, but this time I’ll run away to save my- </p><p>self. Bess, I-” </p><p> Bess had raised her head. The man be-</p><p>fore her read surprise, even amazement, in </p><p>her countenance. </p><p> “You say you run away the other time to</p><p>save me!” she cried. “How come it that </p><p>you run away to save me? Are you crazy, </p><p>Tom, or am I? I don’t know what you </p><p>mean, Tom! Oh, I wisht you hadn’t ha’ </p><p>killed Joe Falls. He ought ’o have been </p><p>killed, but you-” </p><p> “Killed Joe Falls!” cut in the hill man,</p><p>taking the woman by the shoulders. “Why, </p><p>you—you was the one that killed Joe </p><p>Falls. You done it with the little rifle I </p><p>bought for you!” </p><p> “Oh, Tom,” almost hysterically, “you</p><p>know I couldn’t kill a man, don’t you?”</p><p>Light broke to Harman. Suddenly he </p><p>understood: Marvin Blair himself had </p><p>killed Joe Falls, in a card game, of course; </p><p>and afterward Blair had cleverly covered </p><p>his crime and cleared the way to the pretti- </p><p>est girl in the Black Pine section at one </p><p>cunning stroke. </p><p> It threw Harman into a boiling rage.</p><p>And he was disappointed, too. Truly, the </p><p>real friends of a man’s lifetime may be </p><p>counted on one’s fingers, for friendship is </p><p>scarce, and finer, less selfish than any other </p><p>kind of love. But, after all, Blair had wil- </p><p>lingly taken his chance on the tossing of a </p><p>coin. There Tom Harman found himself </p><p>in a dilemma. </p><p> He told Bess all about it. Bess went</p><p>into the cabin and returned a moment later </p><p>with a fully loaded automatic pistol of </p><p>132 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>small caliber, which explained much to </p><p>Harman. That pistol had been used in the </p><p>killing of Joe Falls, he was sure. He un- </p><p>loaded it and gave it back to Bess. </p><p> “Put it where you found it,” he said to</p><p>her. “I’ll be back tonight to have a little </p><p>talk with Marvin,” he went on, turning </p><p>toward the gate, “and you’d better not be </p><p>here.” </p><p> “You ain’t a-goin’ to kill him, Tom!”</p><p> “No, I guess not. I’ll own up that I’d</p><p>like to, but I don’t want to ruin yore future </p><p>and mine by doin’ it.” </p><p> His future and hers! She blushed hap-</p><p>pily- </p><p> Tom’s people told him they had not seen</p><p>Bill Hines for months. Plainly Blair had </p><p>lied. Then Tom and his father laid a plan, </p><p>and Mark Harman took his long rifle and </p><p>went to see that Blair did not try to make </p><p>an escape. </p><p>AT SUNDOWN, while Tom sat at </p><p>the supper-table, Bill Hines walked </p><p>in with a revolver in his hand. </p><p> “I’ve got you, Tom,” he said quietly.</p><p>“Yes, I guess you have, Bill,” replied </p><p>Tom; and he ate on as if it were a very com- </p><p>monplace thing to be arrested on a charge of </p><p>murder. “Have some supper, old hoss?” </p><p>“Thanks, not if I know it,” Hines winked. </p><p>“You’ll play no more tricks on me, Tom. </p><p>You won’t get away this time!” </p><p> “I won’t?” laughed Harman, with a</p><p>broad wedge of huckleberry pie in hands. </p><p>“How do you know I won’t?” </p><p> “Wait and see if you do,” smilingly.</p><p>“When you got away from me three years </p><p>ago you done something to brag about, </p><p>Tom!” </p><p> “I know it. Marvin Blair sent for you,</p><p>didn’t he? Telephoned?” </p><p> Hines declined to answer, and by that,</p><p>Harman knew that he had guessed cor- </p><p>rectly.</p><p> On the mountainside above, a heavily</p><p>built, anxious man watched the Harman </p><p>cabin as a hawk watches a squirrel’s nest, </p><p>and back in the blooming laurels and old </p><p>mountaineer with a long rifle in his hands </p><p>watched him just as closely. When Bill </p><p>Hines had taken his prisoner toward the </p><p>Johnsboro jail, Marvin Blair drew a long </p><p>breath of relief and started rapidly home- </p><p>ward. And behind him, stalking him as </p><p>silently as ever he had stalked a bear or a </p><p>deer, went old Mark Harman. </p><p> It was pitchy dark when Blair reached the</p><p>cabin that he called home. There was no </p><p>light in the log-house, at which he wondered. </p><p>He entered, lighted a lamp that was on a </p><p>small home-made table and called for Bess; </p><p>there was no answer. Frowning, he took </p><p>the automatic pistol from its place on the </p><p>high smoked mantel and dropped it into his </p><p>pocket; and then he sat down at the little </p><p>table and began to turn certain matters over </p><p>in his mind. </p><p> Then the front door opened suddenly,</p><p>and in stepped Tom Harman, and there was </p><p>no officer with him! </p><p> “Hi, Marvin,” said Harman with a very</p><p>good imitation of the camaraderie of the </p><p>old days, as he dropped into a chair across </p><p>the table from Bess’s husband. </p><p> “Hello,” muttered Blair worriedly, and</p><p>his right hand went to the butt of the little </p><p>blue pistol in his coat-pocket. “Seen Bill </p><p>Hines?” </p><p> “Yes. He arrested me, and I got away</p><p>from him,” with a broad smile; it was a </p><p>victorious smile too. </p><p> “How?”</p><p> “Used my brains, like I done before. Also</p><p>I took his star and his gun from him— </p><p>see?” </p><p> He turned his left coat-lapel and showed a</p><p>shining deputy-sheriff’s badge. Just above </p><p>the edge of the table he thrust the round nose </p><p>of a big revolver. </p><p> “I’m actin’ deputy-sheriff now,” he went</p><p>on, his voice growing harder, “and I am</p><p>here to arrest you for killin’ Joe Falls in a </p><p>card game!” </p><p> All in the space of a second Marvin Blair</p><p>darted downward, aimed the little blue </p><p>pistol and pulled the trigger. Harman </p><p>laughed. </p><p> “I’d done unloaded it,” he said, “and I</p><p>watched you when you come in to see that </p><p>you didn’t notice it; and you didn’t. Take </p><p>your chair and let’s have a talk for old </p><p>times’ sake. Maybe I’ll give you a chance.” </p><p> White-faced, Blair crept back into his</p><p>chair. The mountaineer tossed a copper </p><p>cent to the table. </p><p> “Let’s pitch a few heads and tails,” he</p><p>suggested. “To show you I’m game and a </p><p>sport, if you’ll throw heads once out o’ ten </p><p>throws I’ll leave the country and keep my </p><p>mouth shut. I’m a man o’ my word, Mar- </p><p>vin, you know that; but if you don’t throw </p><p>heads once out o’ ten throws, you’re to </p><p>write a confession to clear me, and then </p><p>The Manhood of a Chinaman </p><p>133 </p><p>leave the country yourself, startin’ right </p><p>now. Is it a go?” </p><p> “It’s a go,” weakly and dazedly.</p><p> Blair knew that if ever his case went to</p><p>court he was a doomed man. He picked up </p><p>the penny and tossed it. It fell tails up. </p><p>Three more times in succession it fell tails </p><p>up. It was like a coin enchanted. Blair </p><p>examined it closely in the yellow light of </p><p>the oil lamp; then he swore bitterly and </p><p>threw it disgustedly to the floor. </p><p> “What’s the matter?” asked Harman</p><p>quietly. “Is anything wrong with the </p><p>penny, Marvin? Why, man, it’s the very </p><p>same penny we pitched nearly three years </p><p>ago to see which one of us went up in the </p><p>place o’ the girl we both loved!” </p><p> He went on, in another tone:</p><p> “You scoundrel, you cheat, you low-down</p><p>piker! That penny was made out o’ two </p><p>pennies—it’s got tails on both sides! No </p><p>wonder you was willin’ to take your chance </p><p>on tails! How did I come by it? It was in </p><p>fhe ten cents your wife gi’ me for tellin’ her </p><p>fortune—I didn’t know you was married. </p><p>Now you write that confession and light </p><p>out, or else I take you to Johnsboro. Which </p><p>do you want to do?” </p><p> Blair wrote the confession, signed it and</p><p>gave it to Harman. Then he broke for the </p><p>front door—and ran straight into the pow- </p><p>erful arms of Bill Hines! When Blair had </p><p>been ironed the young mountaineer gave the </p><p>empty revolver and the badge back to its </p><p>owner. Hines, a little distrustful, had </p><p>kept Tom covered while he was working out </p><p>his part of that which had just taken place </p><p>in the cabin. </p><p> When Bess had her separation, Harman</p><p>went to see her. Together they walked </p><p>down to the spring among the laurels, and </p><p>together they sat down on a stone under the </p><p>great, cool green hemlock. </p><p> “There’s one thing I’m dyin’ to know,</p><p>Bess,” said Harman, as he slowly stripped </p><p>the leaves from a fern. “What was that se-</p><p>cret you was keepin’—that big, big scret?” </p><p>Womanlike, she answered his question </p><p>with two questions. </p><p> “Couldn’t you guess, Tom?” blushing.</p><p>“Do I haf to beat it into yore head with a </p><p>club, Tom—honey?” </p><p>iTE WAS taking a hike ’cross </p><p>country. We had laid up at </p><p>Mojave for a few weeks, “cool- </p><p>in’ off, an’ gettin’ civilized </p><p>again,” as Old Wade put it. </p><p> Fact is, we had started for Los Angeles,</p><p>but there chanced to be a pretty good bunch </p><p>of good fellows in town when we struck </p><p>Mojave, and we couldn’t resist the tempta- </p><p>tion to cool off an’ get civilized, although </p><p>the old Times thermometer at the station </p><p>never pointed at less than 120 in the shade, </p><p>and the civilization consisted mostly of sa- </p><p>loons and other joints, with some pretty </p><p>tough citizens for playmates. </p><p> It wasn’t the Mojave of today; they have</p><p>some churches there now, and good schools; </p><p>most of the dives and some of the saloons </p><p>have disappeared, and with them has also </p><p>iaded away a heap of that element of miners </p><p>Tiie Manhood </p><p>a ChinamaiL </p><p>134 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>who used to drop in there for supplies, </p><p>or to blow their gold-dust at poker, crap, </p><p>roulette, tiger or women. It was some town </p><p>in those days; open all around, with the </p><p>skies for the limit. </p><p> And speaking of skies reminds me that</p><p>Measles says once, when we had punched </p><p>a burro and hiked it in from Caliente and </p><p>had stopped to gaze in some wonderment at </p><p>a new gospel house that had located there </p><p>—says he: </p><p> “God’s got His locatin’-stakes out here at</p><p>last. But it’s a blue chip again’ a cigarette </p><p>that He never would of got a claim here if </p><p>the Southern Pacific hadn’t saw it first an’ </p><p>told folks about it.” </p><p> Measles ain’t much along the prophet</p><p>line, but he sometimes speaks parables. </p><p> Well, as I was saying, we was taking a</p><p>hike ’cross country, Old Wade, Measles and </p><p>me. A fool prospector had blowed in to </p><p>Mojave and told us in strict confidence— </p><p>liquor confidence—of a new strike that had </p><p>been made down the valley. He mentioned </p><p>some landmarks, and Old Wade had a full </p><p>page Rand McNally of it in his nut at once. </p><p>He ain’t a guesser, Wade ain’t, on Califor- </p><p>nia localities; he knows. </p><p> We was heading for Milligan. At least</p><p>that’s how the place is known now, for the </p><p>same old S. P. has located it too, now. But </p><p>at that time there wasn’t any Southern </p><p>Pacific, or any Milligan there; it was just </p><p>desert, and black, burnt-out hills. We was </p><p>camped for the night in the hills abovewhere </p><p>the town or town-site of Milligan now is. </p><p> I said we was camped for the night, but</p><p>we wasn’t; we was camped for the day, for </p><p>one does his traveling by night there mostly. </p><p>You would, too, if you was tenderfoot </p><p>enough to once try a daytime hike in </p><p>Death Valley or any of its suburbs. Mea- </p><p>sles was sweating and roasting a Chinaman </p><p>who had bested him at a little game of </p><p>draw in Mojave. </p><p> “They ain’t no good,” says Measles.</p><p>“They’re a dirty, thievin’, lyin’, cowardly, </p><p>cheatin’ bunch, the whole lot of ’em; an’</p><p>the next one I sights I’m goin’ to smoke him </p><p>up proper,” says he. </p><p> “As a bunch,” says Old Wade, “you may</p><p>have ’em sized proper. They sure ain’t </p><p>much on the tidy-up business, but they’ll </p><p>work. And take it from me, Mister Mea- </p><p>sles, you’ll smoke up no Chink while in my </p><p>company unless you can beat me to it in </p><p>drawin’ a gun.” </p><p> At them remarks I kind of raised up and</p><p>took interest in the town topics, for I’ve </p><p>noticed that when Old Wade says “Mister” </p><p>to a man with that peculiar stress placed on </p><p>the said Mister, there’s some feeling in the </p><p>matter, and the said party addressed as Mis- </p><p>ter has somehow trod on slippery ground. </p><p> Measles got the hunch, too, for he looks</p><p>at Old Wade kind of sidewise like, as it were, </p><p>and says: </p><p> “Everybody has got his own ideas about</p><p>Chinks, I guess, same as about anything </p><p>else. I ain’t meanin’ no disrespect about </p><p>any Chinaman friends you may have; but </p><p>if any one has ever noticed a pigtail that </p><p>wasn’t dirty, an’ a thief, an’ a coward, I’d </p><p>like to hear all about him, ’cause I ain’t— </p><p>never.” </p><p> Old Wade didn’t say a word; he just laid</p><p>back and smoked. After a while, though, </p><p>he says, as if he was talking to hisself— </p><p> “He sure was dirty, an’ I reckon he was</p><p>crooked all right, but he wasn’t no coward.” </p><p> “Was you addressin’ me?” says Measles.</p><p> But Old Wade didn’t answer; he just laid</p><p>still and smoked. After a while he sits up </p><p>and looks around, first at the hills, then </p><p>down into the valley where the heat waves </p><p>was dancing, and where the glittering re- </p><p>flections hurt the eyes to look at. Then </p><p>he speaks up; speaks kind of slow and low, </p><p>as if talking to hisself, and says: </p><p> “If I was a painter man an’ could paint</p><p>these hills just as they are; if I could paint </p><p>them cliffs, burned an’ black, with them </p><p>splashes of blood red, an’ them streaks of </p><p>bright yeller an’ green, an’ all colors all </p><p>standin’ out in places, bold an’ bright against </p><p>that far hill of dull warm gray that seems </p><p>to disappear somewheres off there in a sort</p><p>of haze of all colors an’ no colors, banked </p><p>up by that purple bank of mist or clouds, or </p><p>whatever it is, where the eye stops; or if I </p><p>was one of them men that can write words </p><p>what take hold of you an’ grip your throat, </p><p>an’ swell up your heart till you feel an’ know </p><p>that somewhere is God, big enough, an’ </p><p>straight enough, an’ knowin’ enough to </p><p>make them hills, an’ that valley down there </p><p>—that burnin’, scorchin’, killin’ valley, </p><p>down there—that valley with its burnin’ </p><p>sands, its chokin’ alkali, its untold riches, its </p><p>side picters of cool lakes an’ streams where </p><p>there ain’t no water; that valley what </p><p>offers you alkali when you want bread; </p><p>sand when you want breath; a plumb hell- </p><p>heat when you want water; death when you </p><p>The Manhood of a Chinaman </p><p>135 </p><p>want life. Yes,” says Old Wade,standing up </p><p>and holding out his hands, sort as if he was </p><p>going to offer a blessing same as a preach- </p><p>er man—“yes,” says he, “a God brainy </p><p>enough to make all this—this color, this </p><p>stillness, this desert, this heat, an’ to make </p><p>it for a purpose that no man yet knows; </p><p>to make this, the likes of which ain’t no </p><p>place else on earth but in Death Valley. </p><p>I say,” says he, “if I could paint such a pic- </p><p>ter, er write such a piece, I’d-” | </p><p>“Well?” says Measles, sort of gulping. </p><p>“I’d be able to paint the picter, or write </p><p>the description of him,” says Old Wade. </p><p> “Of who?” asks Measles.</p><p> “Of a Chinaman,” says Old Wade, and</p><p>he goes over and leans on a boulder, and me </p><p>and Measles didn’t say anything. </p><p> Pretty soon he comes back, slowly filling</p><p>his pipe. “Tell us about him,” I asks him; </p><p>and he points with his pipe-stem out over </p><p>the valley that here lay glistening and </p><p>white, as if it was paved with snow or ice. </p><p> “Look straight in line with that peak over</p><p>yonder, about three mile out on the valley. </p><p>Do you see that house there?” </p><p>“I see a big rock there,” says Measles. </p><p> “ ’Taint no rock; that’s a hut—a house,”</p><p>says Old Wade. “A house built out of salt, </p><p>rock salt.” </p><p> “Huh!” says Measles.</p><p> “The Chinaman is out there; we buried</p><p>him just forty steps south of the house. </p><p>The whole valley there is a bed of rock salt </p><p>for miles,” says Old Wade. </p><p>“Did you shoot him up?” asks Measles. </p><p>“IT WAS seven year ago now,” an- </p><p>swers Old Wade. “There had been </p><p>a silver rush to a new camp over </p><p>yonder beyond that far range. There’s </p><p>some pretty good stuff in the way of silver </p><p>over there, only everything is all broke up, </p><p>an’ no tellin’ when a lead will pinch out.</p><p> “I reckon there was about forty or fifty</p><p>of us right around there in the near-by hills. </p><p>There wa’n’t no town, only a camp—a few </p><p>tents an’ a shack or two. One gin-palace </p><p>had broke into the game, though, an’ a </p><p>Chinaman runs a washec house an’ does odd </p><p>jobs, an’ plays poker. </p><p> “One day, right in Midsummer, when</p><p>hell didn’t have nothin’ on it for hot, a </p><p>party of three struck the town, an’ it wasn’t </p><p>long till every man thereabouts had fore- </p><p>gathered at the gin-shop to talk about ’em, </p><p>for there was a woman an’ a boy in the </p><p>outfit. Seems they had come West from </p><p>Illinoy, or some of them far Eastern states. </p><p>The man had been a professor in a college </p><p>or correspondence school, or somethin’ like </p><p>that, where they teach all about minin’ to </p><p>tenderfeet who ain’t never saw a mountain. </p><p>They was here to show us minin’ fellers how </p><p>minin’ should be done scientific. </p><p> “He was a nice little feller, all right, an’</p><p>real sociable, when he wasn’t studyin’ out </p><p>some problem in zo-ology or dox-ology, or </p><p>somethin’ like that. An’ the woman! She </p><p>was a wonder! Full of ginger and go, an’ </p><p>she’d shake hands with a feller jest as </p><p>though she was a real man. I don’t jest </p><p>re-collect how it happened or why, but the </p><p>zo-ology man got mixed up with one of the </p><p>boys over a claim, an’ we buried him neat as </p><p>circumstances would allow in a little side </p><p>canon near by. </p><p> “ ’Course the woman takes on somethin’</p><p>grievous. She tells us in several kinds of </p><p>language how we was all murderers, an’ </p><p>thieves, an’ cowards. She gives the high an’ </p><p>mighty to all of us ’cept the Chink. She </p><p>jest naturally adopted that Chinaman an’ </p><p>wouldn’t leave him out of her sight. I </p><p>guess it’s right, all right, that the woman </p><p>human gets a hunch from somewhere as to </p><p>who’s straight goods an’ who ain’t. There </p><p>ain’t no argufyin’ or reasonin’ about it—she </p><p>jest knows. Anyhow, she thinks she does, </p><p>so that settles it with any proper man. </p><p> “Well, she hustles Sam Ling—that’s the</p><p>Chink—’roun’ that camp till he gathers to- </p><p>gether a outfit, an’ they makes ready to </p><p>make their getaway for Los Angeles. The </p><p>Chink strikes me for four bits I owes </p><p>him for wash, an’ says: ‘We stlike um tlail</p><p>to Los Langelis, plitty quick.’ I argues </p><p>with the cuss, an’ told him it was sure death </p><p>for them to tackle a trip through the valley </p><p>in Summer. But the simp only says: ‘She </p><p>say we make um plenty allee light!’ That </p><p>settles it with Sam; whatever she says goes </p><p>with him. </p><p> “I asks him if any of ’em knows the trail,</p><p>an’ he says: ‘She catch um short way— </p><p>over there,’ pointin’ southwest. ‘She plenty </p><p>savey,’ says he. It sure was the short way </p><p>all right, but the devil hisself couldn’t of </p><p>lived an’ made his getaway by that route </p><p>over the desert at that time of year. </p><p> “So I goes to her an’ I says: ‘Madam—’</p><p>the professor used to call her ‘the madam’ </p><p>—I says: ‘Madam, we-all feels mighty cut </p><p>up an’ sorry for you-all, an’ we will some </p><p>136 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>of us go with you if you are boun’ to go. </p><p>You might jest as well take nothin’ with </p><p>you as that fool Chinaman. Besides, you </p><p>can’t get by with it goin’ by the route you- </p><p>all aims to go. There ain’t no water that </p><p>way, an’ hell ain’t a patchin’ to what you’ll </p><p>find down in the valley this time of year.’ </p><p> “She jest kinder sized me up, all up an’</p><p>down like, an’ turns up the end of her nose, </p><p>an’ says somethin’ as how as she pre-fers </p><p>the company of a Chink gent an’ burros to </p><p>the likes of us. An’ the Chink grins, an’ </p><p>says: ‘She plenty good savey.’ So all I </p><p>could do was to re-tire; but I found a chance </p><p>to hit the Chink a kick jest where the back </p><p>end of his shirtce stops as I went out. </p><p> “Well, they started; an’ they didn’t have</p><p>water enough in their outfit to last the </p><p>burro two days, not countin’ themselves. </p><p>It was clean, plumb murder, that’s all. </p><p> “I roun’s up some of the boys an’ we had</p><p>a confab. We hustled together a outfit an’ </p><p>loaded down two burros, mostly with water, </p><p>an’ two of us strikes out through the hills, </p><p>aimin’ to come out about where we decided </p><p>they would be when their water played </p><p>out. </p><p> “We stopped about five mile below here</p><p>an’ watched for them a couple of days, </p><p>scoutin’ in different directions. Along </p><p>about five o’clock my partner shows up an’ </p><p>says he had heard shots somewheres down </p><p>in the valley to the north of us. We struck </p><p>the valley an’ follows the foothills a mile or </p><p>so, an’ then decided to make for the salt </p><p>shack out there. </p><p> “We had gone somethin’ like a mile when</p><p>we foun’ the woman, lyin’ plumb in our track. </p><p>She wasn’t dead, but, my, she was some </p><p>sight! Burned an’ blistered, with her tongue </p><p>swollen an’ stickin’ out of her mouth. She </p><p>wasn’t dead, as I says, but I thought then </p><p>she would of been a whole lot better off if </p><p>she was. </p><p> “We picks her up; she only moaned, an’</p><p>opened an’ shut her hands, wigglin’ an’ </p><p>twistin’ her fingers kind ’er stiff-like. Be- </p><p>tween us we carried her about two mile to </p><p>the salt shack. We found the Chink lyin’</p><p>outside the shack near a seep-hole in the </p><p>rock salt. He had sure crawled there, look- </p><p>in’ fer water. He found some, but it was </p><p>fifty times saltier than sea water. He was </p><p>plumb dead. </p><p> “We takes the woman into the house an’</p><p>works over her till next day, when she </p><p>comes to enough to moan, an’ cry fer water. </p><p>God! I don’t never want to put in such a </p><p>night an’ day as them was. </p><p> “We buried the Chink, an’ that evenin’</p><p>pard went to camp an’ brings one of the </p><p>burros an’ we contrives that night to get </p><p>her to our camp. She was plumb nutty fer </p><p>a week, an’ then what she tells us changes </p><p>my mind a heap concernin’ Chinks. </p><p> “The first night out their burro got to</p><p>thinkin’ as how the hills looks good to him, </p><p>an’ he makes his getaway, carryin’ a keg of </p><p>water with him, that they, bein’ tenderfeet, </p><p>had left cinched on to him. Chink tells </p><p>them to stay there, an’ he strikes out after </p><p>the beast next mornin’, without water. </p><p> “He didn’t find the brute, but managed</p><p>to get back to the woman an’ kid about </p><p>noon. He was all in, I reckon, from what </p><p>she says, but he never complains. He jest </p><p>smiles his Chinaman smile an’ says, ‘Be </p><p>plenty allee light, plitty quick.’ They </p><p>doped him with water, an’ that night they </p><p>starts on again, Chink actin’ as burro an’ </p><p>carryin’ most of the stuff. </p><p> “That night an’ next day they must of</p><p>seen plenty of the hell stored up in Death </p><p>Valley. The Chink wouldn’t hardly touch </p><p>no water, fer he sees it was runnin’ low, but </p><p>he keeps dealin’ out small lots to the others. </p><p>That afternoon the boy went crazy—plumb </p><p>heat nutty—an’ broke away, an’ runs fer a </p><p>lake he thought he seen. Chink runs him </p><p>down, ’er jest naturally picks him up from </p><p>where he had dropped an’ carries him back. </p><p>‘Him be allee light plitty quick; me cally </p><p>him,’ Chink smiles an’ says to the mother. </p><p> “An’ all that day he did carry him.</p><p>Staggerin’, stumblin’, failin’, he always </p><p>comes up with a smile an’ a hopeful word, </p><p>such as, ‘We catch um Los Langelis, allee </p><p>light.’ But the boy died that night; died </p><p>fightin’ his mother an’ the Chink an’ moan- </p><p>in’ fer water, fer by this time all their water</p><p>was gone. Chink’s yaller skin was cracked; </p><p>his lips an’ mouth was swelled, an’ he stag- </p><p>gers like a plain drunk when he tries to </p><p>walk. And still he smiles. </p><p> “They buries the boy about four mile up</p><p>the valley; up there in the sand, jest aroun’ </p><p>that butte you see stickin’ out over there. </p><p>An’ then the woman kerflumixed—went </p><p>down in a heap. She makes signs to Chink, </p><p>tell in’ as how she can’ talk no more on ac- </p><p>count of her heat-swelled throat, an’ can’t </p><p>hike no further. And Chink slings the </p><p>empty water-bag over his shoulder again, </p><p>lifts the woman an’ staggers on, an’ on. </p><p>The White Hope’s Understudy </p><p>137 </p><p>God! what a livin’ hell he was endurin’l </p><p> “He sees the salt shack there an’ tries to</p><p>holler, thinkin’ some one lives there; but </p><p>he couldn’t make no noise with his mouth </p><p>on account of his throat bein’ baked, an’ </p><p>his mouth all swelled out of kilter. But he </p><p>manages to mumble, ‘We catch um housee </p><p>—catch um dlinkee plitty quick, lillee lady.’ </p><p>An’ he staggers on an’ on, carryin’ the little </p><p>lady. Failin’, draggin’ her. God! How </p><p>he must of struggled for breath an’ fought </p><p>for each step! </p><p> “The little lady tells me as how the Chink</p><p>falls with her at the door; how they both </p><p>lays there for hours, till finally she drug </p><p>herself into the shack. Nobody there; a few </p><p>rusty tins; a busted sheet-iron stove. But </p><p>the shade brung her to some, an’ she </p><p>crawls out an’ drags the Chink into the </p><p>shade. All he could do was to smile in a </p><p>kind of leerin’ way, for his face was plumb </p><p>out of shape. </p><p> “She fans him with her hat an’ squeezes</p><p>a few drops of water, hot as fire, out of the </p><p>water-bag. That night he gingers up </p><p>enough to mumble a few words, an’ you </p><p>know how every word was like a knife-jab </p><p>to his blistered throat. In the mornin’ he </p><p>gasps to her, with his Chinaman smile: </p><p>‘Plitty quick—lillee lady—be allee light. </p><p>Go—to—hills. Shootee gun; man —catchee </p><p>noisee. You—allee—light.’ </p><p> “ ‘But you?’ asks the woman. ‘You will</p><p>die here!’ </p><p> “ ‘No kin,’ says the Chink. ‘Me—</p><p>catchee—lest—plenty—well—plitty quick.’ </p><p>“An’ she left him. An’ she stumbles on </p><p>through the blisterin’ heat, an’ over the </p><p>rough blocks of rock salt, shootin’ her gun </p><p>every now an’ then. An’ then, says she, </p><p>that’s all she knows. </p><p> “We patches her up an’ finally lands her</p><p>in Los Angeles, an’ she beat it back East, </p><p>pronto. The last words she says to me at </p><p>the depot was: </p><p> “ ‘Some time get my boy an’ the China-</p><p>man an’ send ’em to me.’</p><p> “I ain’t never done it yet; but some time</p><p>when I make a strike, I will,” says Old Wade. </p><p>An’ Measles stan’s up an’ blows his nose </p><p>powerful hard an’ says, pointin’ over to the </p><p>salt shack: </p><p> “I takes off my hat to you, Mister Chink;</p><p>an’ tomorrow I’m goin’ over to where you </p><p>are planted an’ appologize fer bein’ a hea- </p><p>then myself.” </p><p> And I made up my mind that I sure would</p><p>go with him. For whether he was a Chink </p><p>or a Mex, he was some real man, and God </p><p>don’t let so many of them loose as He might. </p><p>HIS is not a Sunday-school story. </p><p>Certainly it is not in theme, </p><p>and quite unconsciously, if at </p><p>all, in treatment. To those </p><p>ubiquitous kill-joys who, Diogenes-like, go, </p><p>lantern in hand, through the dark passages </p><p>of fiction seeking, not an honest man, but </p><p>a red-nosed, sniffling moral, I say here and </p><p>now, and, senator-like, without fear of con- </p><p>tradiction, that there is no moral. </p><p>A moral hints of superhuman wire-pulling </p><p>and miracles and things like that, but there </p><p>138 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>is no miracle here but the miracle of youth, </p><p>and all the wire-pulling that was done fell </p><p>to the sunken hands of Doc Saunders, who </p><p>was far from superhuman—poor manl </p><p>DENNY’S excitement was positive </p><p>agony. It mounted him in recurring </p><p>waves, starting from his toes and </p><p>ending by leaping at his throat and choking </p><p>him. It created a horrible aching vacuum </p><p>in the pit of his stomach, and folded itself </p><p>round and round his heart like a thick </p><p>blanket. Now and then it was akin to </p><p>nausea. </p><p> It was dark in the little rough-boarded</p><p>room beneath the stands. The one window </p><p>looked out on a forest of piling, through </p><p>which one caught a glimpse of a white street </p><p>running between low, square houses of </p><p>cream and coral and pale yellow adobe. </p><p> Over the roofs of these houses Denny</p><p>could see the mountains shrugging their </p><p>shoulders against the blue. His mountains! </p><p>An acute longing for them went through </p><p>him like a pain. They were so peaceful and </p><p>silent and remote, and here everything was </p><p>blatant with sound and terrifying with the </p><p>overwhelming nearness of the many. Over- </p><p>head, twenty thousand feet tramped and </p><p>stamped and shuffled; ten thousand voices </p><p>mingled with hysterical effect. And always </p><p>new feet were joining them, fresh voices </p><p>adding their mite to the uproar. </p><p> It was quiet enough in the dark little</p><p>room. There was a lull in the coming and </p><p>going of excited, clamorous men. “Skip- </p><p>per” Burns had taken his lieutenants and </p><p>his perspiration and his studs into final con- </p><p>ference with the champion’s manager, his </p><p>lieutenants and his studs. Doc Saunders </p><p>had barred the door to the curious, and only </p><p>he and Denny and the rubbers remained </p><p>with Gene Williamson, the challenger. </p><p> The latter lay naked on a sheet-covered</p><p>board, a herculean man, as tall and thick </p><p>and rugged as an oak. His body was </p><p>strangely white. In the dim light it glowed </p><p>corpse-like. The rubbers hunched over </p><p>him, their hands making soft, patting </p><p>sounds. </p><p> Denny did not look at Gene, but at Saun-</p><p>ders, who faced the window and the light, </p><p>which fell upon his face and revealed with </p><p>cruel distinctness the ravages of a dread </p><p>disease. His eyes were very bright, but </p><p>covered with a strange glassy film. They </p><p>were blue eyes, so dark a blue they often </p><p>seemed black, and their gaze was discon- </p><p>certingly level. </p><p> No one endured that gaze for very long,</p><p>perhaps for fear of revealing to him their </p><p>understanding and their pity. One felt in- </p><p>stinctively that his was too proud a spirit </p><p>to bear pity. </p><p> Where he had come from no one knew</p><p>and no one cared to ask, least of all Denny </p><p>Boone, for all that Saunders was so kind to </p><p>him. He had drifted into the training camp </p><p>one day and become a fixture, quite natur- </p><p>ally, without meeting with protest or offer- </p><p>ing explanation. It had come out somehow </p><p>or other that he was a doctor who had given </p><p>up his practise. </p><p> Skipper Burns welcomed his medical</p><p>knowledge and his worldly knowledge as </p><p>well. He seemed to have as extensive an </p><p>acquaintance with ring history as did Skip- </p><p>per, and his ideas on diet and training were </p><p>authoritative. </p><p> He it had been who advised retaining</p><p>Denny Boone as a sparring partner for the </p><p>challenger. The boy had ridden in from </p><p>the mines back in the mountains and tim- </p><p>idly offered his services. Skipper Burns </p><p>told him kindly but firmly to go to -. </p><p>Burns was a kiridly man, but he had been </p><p>pestered almost out of his existence by as- </p><p>piring amateurs. </p><p> But the doctor had taken the boy by the</p><p>arm, and, staring all the while into his eyes, </p><p>had run his fingers up and down the other’s </p><p>sleeve from the wrist to the shoulder. </p><p>Denny had stiffened under his touch. There </p><p>was something potentially galvanic in those </p><p>thin fingers. And he had met the doctor’s </p><p>scrutiny without winking. His conscience </p><p>was like his blue eyes, unclouded. </p><p> “Strip!” Saunders had commanded in</p><p>his thin, husky voice.</p><p> Burns raised impatient yet respectful</p><p>protest. </p><p> “Aw, Doc, whatta you ringin’ in a kid</p><p>like that for at this stage of the game? </p><p>Besides he ain’t more than a middle- </p><p>weight.” </p><p> Again those fingers swept up and down</p><p>the boy’s arm. </p><p> “A shade under two hundred, Skipper.”</p><p> When they stripped Denny and put him</p><p>on the scales the beam balanced at one </p><p>hundred and ninety-eight. </p><p> He had only been in the ring with Wil-</p><p>liamson the fraction of a moment when </p><p>Burns dashed in between them. </p><p>The White Hope’s Understudy </p><p>139 </p><p> “Say!” he accused Denny. “I thought</p><p>you said you hadn’t fought before?” </p><p>“I’ve not really fought, sir,” blushed the </p><p>boy; “just with the men around the mine.” </p><p>“G’wan! What do you take me for? </p><p>You never learned no guard like that around </p><p>a mine. Who’s been teachin’ you?” </p><p> “Jeff Moloney, sir. He’s foreman of our</p><p>shift.” </p><p> “Moloney? Old Jeff Moloney, the wel-</p><p>ter? Why in the blue-blazes didn’t you say </p><p>so?” </p><p> Burns turned to the doctor in great ex-</p><p>citement. </p><p> “Didja see how he covers up and fights</p><p>from under, Doc? It’s the nigger’s style </p><p>down to the ground. He’s just what we </p><p>want to practise this wild-hittin’ Irishman </p><p>of mine on. Go in, boy, and let him try </p><p>to hit you. Take it easy. Under, Gene, </p><p>under, I tell you! Cut out that swingin’ </p><p>like a gate and come from under. You can’t </p><p>hurt the top of his head. Under!” </p><p> The pudgy manager was all perspiration</p><p>and delight when he sent the men to the </p><p>showers. His charge was encountering just </p><p>that defense he would meet with in the </p><p>great battle. </p><p> “The kid’s a jewel,” he crowed. “Didja</p><p>see him, Doc? He covers up like an angel, </p><p>and he’s got a kick in each paw.” </p><p> “He has more than that, Skipper,” smiled</p><p>Saunders enigmatically. “He has the </p><p>greatest asset of all—a clean heart!” </p><p> Burns looked depressed. The Doc was</p><p>always shooting something over that he </p><p>couldn’t wise to. </p><p> As far as Denny was concerned Saunders</p><p>was all enigma. He felt drawn to him and </p><p>yet repelled. He respected him and he </p><p>feared him, frail and wasted as he was. </p><p>There was something uncanny in that frail </p><p>body, teetering on the grave’s edge, some- </p><p>thing awe-inspiring in those too bright eyes </p><p>that seemed to pierce through the mortal</p><p>curtains to the Great Hinterland. And yet </p><p>his presence was a tonic to the boy; his </p><p>touch, somehow, made him feel strong. </p><p> The importance of conditioning William-</p><p>son had dwarfed all other considerations in </p><p>the camp, and Denny’s needs, scant as they </p><p>were, would have been neglected had it not </p><p>been for Saunders. He rubbed the boy </p><p>down with his own hands after the sparring </p><p>matches. He seemed to experience a holy </p><p>joy in handling that splendid young body, </p><p>but a bitterness showed through the joy </p><p>which made Denny very uncomfortable. It </p><p>was impossible to pity him. </p><p> He was deserving of pity, the boy de-</p><p>cided, as he watched him now. His skin </p><p>was waxy-pale, and his scanty sorrel beard </p><p>could not hide the blue hollows in his cheeks. </p><p>One did not have to hear the hacking cough </p><p>issue from his flat chest to know. </p><p> Suddenly he turned his head and met the</p><p>boy’s eyes. Denny looked down quickly, </p><p>but not quickly enough, he feared, to pre- </p><p>vent the other reading his thought. </p><p> “Denny,” came from Saunders as sud-</p><p>denly as that glance had come, “do you </p><p>remember your mother?” </p><p> Denny looked up, wide-eyed and startled</p><p>by this question, so irrelevant to the time </p><p>and the place. </p><p> “No, sir,” he managed to say. “She died</p><p>when I was a baby.” </p><p> “She was a Norwegian,” the man went</p><p>on, his eyes strangely dreamy; “a great </p><p>splendid figure of a woman, true daughter </p><p>of the North and the Vikings. Your father </p><p>was Scotch-Irish. You see I have been </p><p>looking you up! He stood six feet two in his </p><p>stocking feet. Ah, Denny, Denny, lad, </p><p>what a wonderful heritage!” </p><p> “My father and mother were cousins,”</p><p>he went on after a pause. </p><p> The boy stirred uncomfortably. Once</p><p>Saunders had looked at him his excitement </p><p>had been wiped out as completely as a wet </p><p>sponge wipes out the figures on a slate; but </p><p>he rather preferred that excitement, pain- </p><p>ful as it had been, to this.</p><p> “You’re twenty years old,” the other</p><p>mused aloud. “You’ve never smoked?” </p><p> “No, sir.”</p><p> “Never touched liquor?”</p><p> “No, sir.”</p><p> “Never—but I can see that. Ah, Denny,</p><p>lad!” </p><p> The silence that ensued was really de-</p><p>pressing. Denny stared out at his moun- </p><p>tains, and wished fervently that he were </p><p>among them, wished that he were anywhere </p><p>but here, wrapped about by the embarrass- </p><p>ing silence. </p><p>AND then that silence was snapped </p><p>as a thin cord is. </p><p> “Doc!”</p><p> It was Williamson.</p><p> “Doc!”</p><p> There was no mistaking significance in</p><p>that throaty cry. Saunders glided over like </p><p>140 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>a cat and brushed the rubbers aside and </p><p>back. The order came casually enough, but </p><p>with a crisp undertone that had a disturb- </p><p>ingly electric quality: </p><p> “Bring me the ice-bucket, Denny.”</p><p> The boy obeyed, and the little action left</p><p>him breathless. He was vaguely aware that </p><p>the rubbers stood beside him, tense as </p><p>statues. He was tense himself, with horror. </p><p> In spite of the dim light he saw that Wil-</p><p>liamson’s lips were blue and the rest of his </p><p>face dead-white, like the belly of a fish. </p><p>His eyes were rolled far back, so that only a </p><p>small arc of the iris showed beneath the </p><p>upper lids. Even as the boy looked, a gray </p><p>froth bubbled from one corner of the challen- </p><p>ger’s mouth. </p><p> With movements surprisingly deliberate,</p><p>Saunders lifted -the bucket with its tinkling </p><p>contents and dashed a portion over Wil- </p><p>liamson’s face, then his hairy chest, then </p><p>his stomach. The outer wall of the latter </p><p>winced inward from the icy contact, his dia- </p><p>phragm jerked up into his chest, and he </p><p>drew in a long, sibilant breath. </p><p> “Doc!” he moaned, exhaling.</p><p> Denny’s tenseness melted. Every muscle</p><p>collapsed into fiaccidity, every nerve began </p><p>to tingle until he was shivering wretchedly </p><p>from head to foot. He was stark afraid. </p><p> “A towel!” commanded Saunders.</p><p> Neither Denny nor the rubbers stirred.</p><p>They were not able. Saunders whirled im- </p><p>patiently, flashed a look at the boy and </p><p>smiled. Under the lash of that look Denny </p><p>had hurried for the towel. The doctor </p><p>dipped it in what was left of the ice-water </p><p>and bound it about Williamson’s head, cov- </p><p>ering his eyes. </p><p> “What’s the matter?”</p><p> They had not heard the door open, and</p><p>the cry, shrill with premonition, made them </p><p>turn. There stood Burns, his face blotchy, </p><p>his paunch quivering, his big studs winking </p><p>and blinking malevolently in the light from</p><p>the little window. Behind him stood other </p><p>men: the governor of a neighboring state, </p><p>who was to make the presentation speeches, </p><p>the promoter of the fight, pink and perspir- </p><p>ing, Ike Richards, manager for Jake Jen- </p><p>kins, the negro champion. The door was </p><p>filled with curious faces, all strained with </p><p>the same unreasoning dismay. </p><p> “His heart,” explained Saunders briefly.</p><p>“I was afraid of it. Overstrain. He can’t </p><p>fight.” </p><p> “O Gawd!” moaned Burns and went limp.</p><p> He made no move toward Williamson. It</p><p>was curious that neither he nor any of those </p><p>with him thought to question Saunders’s </p><p>decision. For a moment there was a </p><p>stunned silence and then, like a far-off wind </p><p>ever growing nearer, a whisper spread and </p><p>grew. It was stilled abruptly by a rasping </p><p>command from the doctor. </p><p> “Don’t let any one get upstairs with this.</p><p>We mustn’t let them know—yet.” </p><p> “What can be done? What can be done?”</p><p>palpitated the governor. </p><p> “O Gawd!”</p><p> “There must be a fight!” This from the</p><p>promoter, with tears in his eyes. “There </p><p>are fifteen thousand out there. And all </p><p>those Mex soldiers. There’ll be a riot.” </p><p> “-!” cut in Richards roughly.</p><p>“There’ll be war.” </p><p> “Find a substitute.”</p><p> They all looked at Saunders with quick</p><p>relief. </p><p> “Cal Motter is out there-”</p><p> “And Dreadnought Green!”</p><p> “Hog-fat the both of them,” groaned the</p><p>promoter. “It would be a joke.” </p><p> “It’s a bum joke, any way you look at it,”</p><p>said Richards. “Who is around that is in </p><p>training?” </p><p> Following the question they were silent,</p><p>staring at Saunders. Without effort on his </p><p>part he had taken command. All instinc- </p><p>tively looked to him for the answer. </p><p> There was a little ghost of a smile on his</p><p>lips that was reassuring. Slowly he turned </p><p>and looked at Denny Boone; and all eyes </p><p>followed his. Then he looked back. </p><p> “Let’s go outside, gentlemen, and talk</p><p>this over,” he said quietly. </p><p> They filed slowly out with little curious</p><p>glances over their shoulders. The rubbers </p><p>went with them. They seemed eager to get </p><p>away from that white, hoarsely breathing </p><p>man on the sheet-covered board. The doc- </p><p>tor went last of all, closing the door behind </p><p>him. Denny was left alone with the broken </p><p>challenger. </p><p> His first act was to move over into the</p><p>far corner from Gene Williamson, and slump </p><p>weakly on a bench. Reason told him that </p><p>the latter could be in no danger. The doctor </p><p>would not have left him'so callously, had he </p><p>been. Nevertheless, Denny could not con- </p><p>quer an inward shrinking. The whole </p><p>ironic situation was too truly horrible. He </p><p>could scarce believe Fate able to play such </p><p>a prank upon that huge, massive frame </p><p>The White Hope’s Understudy </p><p>141 </p><p>glooming almost ghastly in the half-light. </p><p>It looked too competent, too self-sufficient, </p><p>too perfect a creation of flesh to harbor a </p><p>flaw. The thing was incredible. </p><p> He was glad when two Red Cross assist-</p><p>ants came in and bore Williamson away. </p><p>He hoped the big fellow was unconscious. </p><p>He was such a wholesome, good-natured </p><p>fellow, and he had worked so hard and so </p><p>hopefully, for this! </p><p> Denny sucked in his breath sharply and</p><p>hurried to the window where he could look </p><p>out at the mountains, his mountains. Why </p><p>had he ever left them? He did not like this </p><p>cruel game. He had only come because </p><p>Moloney had insisted. There was some- </p><p>thing he could teach the challenger, the old </p><p>welter had said. But of what avail was that </p><p>teaching now? Williamson was out of it. </p><p>Somebody had to take his place. </p><p> He shivered. He remembered how Saun-</p><p>ders had turned and looked at him—how </p><p>they all had looked at him. He remem- </p><p>bered those curious backward glances. </p><p>They had looked first at him and then at </p><p>Gene Williamson. There was something </p><p>movingly significant in their fastening upon </p><p>him the priority of interest. Of a sudden </p><p>the feet and the warring voices overhead </p><p>took on a new sound, one that concerned </p><p>him intimately. His eyes clung to the </p><p>mountains in a desperate effort to absorb </p><p>from them a portion of their serenity and </p><p>strength. </p><p> A hand fell upon his shoulder. He stiffen-</p><p>ed, as he always did when Saunders touched </p><p>him. Slowly he turned and met those </p><p>blue eyes, a blue so deep it was almost black. </p><p> Saunders was smiling faintly. Both the</p><p>smile and his eyes conveyed a meaning </p><p>Denny strove desperately to avoid. </p><p> “How—how is Gene?” he faltered.</p><p> “Oh, Gene? He’ll be all right with a little</p><p>rest. But the fight must come off, Denny. </p><p>We’ve found a substitute.” </p><p> “Who?” The boy’s lips hardly formed</p><p>the word.</p><p> Saunders’s answer was even more inaudi-</p><p>ble. It was not even spoken. His fingers </p><p>tightened on Denny’s shoulder; and Denny </p><p>knew. </p><p> It was a comforting touch, that Denny’s</p><p>thoughts, emotions, even muscles, which a </p><p>moment before had been asserting them- </p><p>selves independently, suddenly became cen- </p><p>tralized and obedient to his will. He could </p><p>think of but one objection. </p><p> “But Gene’s trunks won’t fit me, sir.”</p><p> Saunders’s face became radiant.</p><p> “I knew it! Not a blemish! Ah, Denny,</p><p>lad!” </p><p> Denny hadn’t the least idea what he was</p><p>talking about. He suffered himself to be </p><p>led to a chair and stripped. He became </p><p>aware then that Burns was also in the room. </p><p> “Do your best for me, kid,” pleaded the</p><p>stout manager pathetically. “I’ve treated </p><p>you square, now, haven’t I? Don’t let ’em </p><p>show me up too bad. It’s awful, awful! </p><p>Who’d ever have thought Gene would go </p><p>back on me this way?” </p><p> His grief was so profound one did not</p><p>dare hint the selfishness of it. </p><p> “Three years I trained him for this,</p><p>three long years. It’s awful! It wouldn’t </p><p>be so bad if I had spent some time with you, </p><p>Denny, but I couldn’t spare a minute from </p><p>Gene. And now you’re goin’ into the big </p><p>fight and I haven’t shown you nothing.” </p><p>Saunders bristled a little. </p><p> “He has something more than you could</p><p>ever show him, Skipper!” </p><p> “Huh!” grunted the other jealously.</p><p>“What’s that?” </p><p> “Have you ever heard of Galahad?”</p><p>“Naw! And I’ve heard of all the fancy. </p><p>Was he a heavy?” </p><p> Saunders smiled and paraphrased:</p><p> His strength was as the strength of ten,</p><p> Because his heart was pure. . . .</p><p> “Huh! One of them book champs,”</p><p>growled Burns. </p><p> “And a good one, Skipper. He whipped</p><p>all comers in his time.” </p><p> “Yeah, but that wasn’t in Jake Jenkins’s</p><p>time.” The pudgy manager coughed as he </p><p>recalled his duty. “But you ain’t afraid of </p><p>a nigger, are you, Denny? And Jake’s just </p><p>half trained.” </p><p> “On the contrary,” frowned the doctor,</p><p>“he’s trained down fine, a perfect fighting </p><p>machine—in so far as it is possible for him </p><p>to be perfect. Skipper, would you mind </p><p>running out and seeing if they are ready for </p><p>us yet?” </p><p> It was a flagrant dismissal, but Burns</p><p>took it with good grace. He was too </p><p>crushed to care or feel. Saunders closed </p><p>the door after him and returned and sat </p><p>down by Denny, who was dressed now for </p><p>the ring. </p><p> “Lad,” he said—and there was a singing</p><p>undertone of tenderness in his voice— </p><p>142 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>“you’ve never done a bad deed, you’ve </p><p>never had a mean thought. Your body </p><p>proves it, your eyes show it, and for that </p><p>reason you are the only man today fitted to </p><p>whip Jake Jenkins. </p><p> “Let me tell you something: Whenever</p><p>a inan does wrong or thinks wrong a little </p><p>hollow place opens up inside him. The </p><p>more he does and thinks wrong the more </p><p>that place widens and widens.” </p><p> He struck the boy a sudden sharp blow.</p><p>“You’re solid, Dennis Boone. Do you </p><p>understand?” </p><p> “I’m afraid not, sir.”</p><p> That radiance flashed into Saunders’s</p><p>gaunt face again. </p><p> “Good for you, Denny, lad. If you had</p><p>understood, there would be a little hollow </p><p>place opening in you now. Here is some- </p><p>thing you can understand: </p><p> “You and Jenkins fight alike. It is curi-</p><p>ous how much alike it is. But I suppose it </p><p>comes from Moloney. He handled Jenkins </p><p>when the black was first breaking in. Both </p><p>of you cover up alike. Your head-guard </p><p>is well-nigh perfect. The result is that this </p><p>fight is going to be a body fight. You un- </p><p>derstand? Give him your body, Denny, as </p><p>long as you can get to his. Trade with him, </p><p>and you’ll come out ahead. He may hit </p><p>harder, but he’ll have something harder to </p><p>hit, for—and remember nothing but this </p><p>from now on—Jenkins is hollowI Say it </p><p>over and over to yourself, Denny, lad: </p><p>‘Jenkins is hollow!’ For he is hollow, and </p><p>you’ve got to cave him in!” </p><p> His pause was more emphatic than his</p><p>words even. </p><p> “I don’t have to tell you to keep your</p><p>chin out of his way. And—say it, Denny! </p><p>Jenkins is hollow!” </p><p> “Jenkins is hollow!” echoed the boy obe-</p><p>diently. “And I’ve got to cave him in!” </p><p>Saunders dropped a thin hand upon his </p><p>forearm and squeezed. </p><p> “All ready,” sang out Skipper Burns, as</p><p>he entered with a cloud of assistants at his </p><p>heels. </p><p> In a moment Denny was surrounded,</p><p>meeting awe and wonder and respect in eyes </p><p>that had hardly heeded him hitherto. </p><p>“You’re not nervous, kid?” </p><p> “Stuff!” barked Saunders.</p><p> He threw a bathrobe over Denny’s shoul-</p><p>ders, and linking arms, led him off. </p><p> Denny was not nervous. He wondered</p><p>vaguely why he was not, and then decided </p><p>that it was Saunders’s arm pressing against </p><p>his that rendered him so very cool. It was </p><p>not the pressure so much as what that pres- </p><p>sure conveyed; what he read in those al- </p><p>most black eyes. He knew he would not be </p><p>afraid, having those eyes upon him. Jen- </p><p>kins was hollow, was hollow! And he had </p><p>to cave him in—for Saunders’s sake! </p><p> “We want you on hand to stop the trouble</p><p>if there is any, lad,” said Saunders, as they </p><p>moved down an aisle under the stands. </p><p>“We’re going to push you right out there in </p><p>the middle, where they can all see you. </p><p>And if anybody is disappointed after seeing </p><p>you with nothing on but trunks and shoes, </p><p>why—why, I’ll give them their money back </p><p>out of my own pocket.” </p><p>[$v THEY climbed up a short flight of </p><p>i* stairs and emerged through a narrow </p><p>opening into the blazing sunlight. </p><p>Everything was so acutely clear it pained </p><p>the eyes. Denny had visited the stands </p><p>that morning when they were empty, and </p><p>had some difficulty in persuading himself </p><p>that this was the same place. </p><p> They had come from under the ring which</p><p>was elevated some few feet above the main </p><p>floor. It stood in the center of a considera- </p><p>ble level space given over to the ring-side </p><p>seats. Behind and above these were the </p><p>railed-in boxes, and behind and above the </p><p>boxes, again, were other seats, rising tier </p><p>on tier. </p><p> It seemed to Denny that he was walled</p><p>in by nothing but faces and eyes; but he did </p><p>not shrink. Saunders’s arm was still locked </p><p>with his.</p><p> The governor of the neighboring state was</p><p>speaking, but with little effect. Those in </p><p>the higher seats could not hear, and were </p><p>making the fact known so loudly that they </p><p>were almost imposing the same conditions </p><p>on all. Only those in the ring-side can be </p><p>said to have heard that Gene Williamson </p><p>could not fight, and that his place would </p><p>be taken by- </p><p> A perfect yell of anger and protest</p><p>drowned the governor out, over which the </p><p>metallic chatter of the released telegraph- </p><p>instruments rose supreme. </p><p> “Now, lad,” hissed Saunders.</p><p> He flicked the robe from Denny’s shoul-</p><p>ders and shoved him through the ropes, </p><p>where the governor took his hand and led </p><p>him to the center of the ring. </p><p> He had a proud, regal carriage, this</p><p>■ML </p><p>The White Hope’s Understudy </p><p>143 </p><p>mine boy, Dennis Boone. He bad a proud </p><p>lift to his blond head, and a serenity of </p><p>countenance that was a beautiful thing to </p><p>see. Very straight he stood in his line </p><p>young strength, with the sunlight sparkling </p><p>on his naked torso, and his unwavering eyes </p><p>meeting the eyes of the multitude. Some- </p><p>thing of a Viking he looked, and something </p><p>of a young pagan god. </p><p> The yells from the ring-side subsided into</p><p>a sullen mutter, and then into a shamed </p><p>silence. Then, like the first gentle drops of </p><p>a Summer rain, came a light clapping of </p><p>hands—a woman’s hands surely! Other </p><p>hands assisted. The shower became an </p><p>approving downpour. The gallery cheered </p><p>blithely, ignorant for the most part that this </p><p>was not the advertised challenger. A group </p><p>of native soldiery on one of the topmost </p><p>rows, overcome by enthusiasm, or perhaps </p><p>mescal, capped the climax with a fusillade of </p><p>revolver shots directed skyward. Feminine </p><p>shrieks were drowned in a wave of mascu- </p><p>line laughter. Handkerchiefs and broad- </p><p>brimmed sombreros were flaunted; good- </p><p>humor reigned again. </p><p> Little Doc Saunders, in his seat in Den-</p><p>ny’s corner, smiled and rubbed his hands. </p><p> The demonstration had scarcely begun to</p><p>abate when it spurted into new and greater </p><p>activity. It mounted wave on wave to the </p><p>point of hysteria. The champion had ar- </p><p>rived! </p><p> All one gold-toothed smile, Jenkins, at-</p><p>tired in a vivid green dressing-gown, leaped </p><p>nimbly through the ropes, and stood grinning </p><p>and bowing to the applause like a plant in a </p><p>gale. The management, with much wisdom, </p><p>had decided to dispense with the usual ora- </p><p>tory and introductions, and to stage the </p><p>fight before any malcontents could incite a </p><p>disturbance. So long as they could feast on </p><p>battle the crowd would be content. What </p><p>furrowed deep valleys in the promoter’s </p><p>pink brow was: Would that feast continue </p><p>long enough to whet the appetite of the </p><p>blood-lustful? </p><p> “How long do you think the kid will</p><p>last?” he screeched to be heard above the </p><p>uproar; but he only got a mournful shake of</p><p>the head from Burns, and from Saunders an </p><p>enigmatic smile. </p><p> Jenkins had ceased bowing, although the</p><p>storm of sound was scarcely diminished. He </p><p>flung aside his dressing-gown and began to </p><p>Umber up his muscles, stretching, dancing </p><p>daintily on his toes, shadow-boxing, all with </p><p>the same pleased self-consciousness that </p><p>animates the strutting peacock. </p><p> Denny, from his corner where the seconds</p><p>were kneading his limbs and binding his </p><p>hands with tape, watched the big black. </p><p>He did not look at the tremendous body or </p><p>the knotted muscles flowing up and down </p><p>beneath the coppery skin; he looked at </p><p>Jenkins’s face. </p><p> The negro was all smiles, good-nature,</p><p>but behind the smile the boy sensed some- </p><p>thing that roused a slowly mounting ani- </p><p>mosity. It was not anger, rather a cold </p><p>scorn. In Jenkins’s thick lips, in his low </p><p>forehead, the slanting skull, the wide, brutal </p><p>nostrils, was revealed a capacity for evil, </p><p>and more, a familiarity with evil, and more </p><p>yet, a compliance toward evil that jarred </p><p>on the virgin instincts of Denny Boone. </p><p>The very sight of Jenkins made him bristle </p><p>as a dog will bristle when it comes upon </p><p>a brute scent. </p><p> “He’s hollow—hollow!” ran his thought,</p><p>grimly, joyfully. “I must cave him in!” </p><p> He felt no shadow of repugnance against</p><p>punishing this, his fellow ;creature. He </p><p>hated him. He did not hate him because </p><p>his skin was black, but because that was </p><p>the color of Jenkins’s soul. </p><p> The world-famous referee entered the ring</p><p>and beckoned the two fighters to him. </p><p>Briefly he introduced them, and gave his in- </p><p>structions. </p><p> “Howdy,” grinned Jenkins, thrusting</p><p>out a big black paw. “Howdy, li’l massa. I </p><p>hopes you ain’t goin’ to hold it agin ol’ </p><p>Jake if he hu’ts you a bit. He’ll try an’ </p><p>not hu’t you much. But he’s tellin’ you </p><p>now dat he cain’t stay aroun’ hyar very </p><p>long. He’s got er engagement. I’se got </p><p>some money to deposit,” he leered. </p><p> Denny said nothing. He had been</p><p>warned that Jenkins was a great kidder and </p><p>would try to rouse him to anger; but the </p><p>black’s chaffing did not worry him; nothing </p><p>about Jenkins worried Denny. He knew </p><p>that he was hollow. He could tell it from </p><p>his face. </p><p> The boy’s silence excited the champion to</p><p>flannel-throated laughter. </p><p> “Look at li’l massa,” he jerked back over</p><p>his shoulder to his seconds. “Jes’ look at </p><p>li’l massa, will you? He’s too proud to talk </p><p>wid a nigger. Why, he’s got his back up </p><p>wid ol’ Jake.” </p><p> Denny said nothing.</p><p> The two went back to their corners and</p><p>144 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>were fitted into their gloves. Behind him </p><p>Denny could hear Burns and his friends </p><p>holding a mourners’ session. The Skipper </p><p>was frankly near tears. Before him, about </p><p>him, below and above, rising tier on tier, the </p><p>boy could see nothing but faces and eyes, </p><p>eyes and faces. From the seats nearest, es- </p><p>pecially from the newspaper section, he met </p><p>many glances, some of interest, and some of </p><p>amusement, but the far greater number of </p><p>pity-. </p><p> His lips just moved in a smile. They</p><p>didn’t know that Jenkins was hollow. </p><p> “Denny, lad,” whispered Saunders, lean-</p><p>ing through the ropes. “Remember!” </p><p> “Yes, sir,” said Denny.</p><p> A gong rang. Silence fell.</p><p> “Ready, li’ massa,” Jenkins sang out.'</p><p>THEY met in the center of the ring </p><p>and touched hands perfunctorily. </p><p>Simultaneously they fell into a </p><p>crouch, the hands held high and parallel </p><p>with the chin, the elbows well in over the </p><p>stomach. With the same slow, rocking </p><p>movement of the shoulders they circled eye </p><p>to eye. </p><p> A titter frothed from the audience and</p><p>swelled into a laugh. The fighters, except </p><p>for their skins, were so alike in pose it was </p><p>truly ridiculous. The angle of their bodies, </p><p>the slow, cat-like tread of their feet, the </p><p>hunched shoulders, the lifted hands paral- </p><p>lel with the chin—they were alike in all </p><p>those things. </p><p> Jenkins’s smile tightened a little as he</p><p>heard that laugh. His lips lifted until his </p><p>gums were revealed. It was no longer a </p><p>smile, but a snarl. </p><p> He was smiling again immediately, but</p><p>in those lifted lips Denny had seen the brute, </p><p>and antipathy sang through him like a </p><p>clarion call. He stepped in, feinted with his </p><p>left at that grinning black face, and drove </p><p>his right in wickedly just below the arch of </p><p>the other’s breastbone.</p><p> The blow landed cleanly, resoundingly.</p><p>The crowd acclaimed. </p><p> Again Jenkins’s gums showed as he leaped</p><p>upon the boy like a lithe black panther. He </p><p>struck as swiftly as a released steel spring, </p><p>short, jerking blows to the head. </p><p> But Denny’s hands were there. Glove</p><p>met only glove. Rocking, swaying, he </p><p>slipped inside the blows until his chin was </p><p>against the negro’s shoulder. Almost lean- </p><p>ing against each other they stood and ex- </p><p>changed rights and lefts to the body. </p><p>Roughly the champion thrust Denny away. </p><p>His incredibly swift upper-cut just flicked </p><p>the boy’s brow. </p><p> “Why, li’l massa,” he cried reproachfully,</p><p>as he dropped his hands and straightened </p><p>up. “Is you tryin’ to steal ol’ Jake’s bus’- </p><p>ness? I didn’t think you’d be er copy-cat. </p><p>If you insists on fightin’ dataway, why I’ll </p><p>fight disaway.” </p><p> He leaned backward, arms extended in</p><p>burlesque mimicry of Fitzsimmons’s famous </p><p>pose. Denny said nothing. Shoulders </p><p>hunched, he rocked in slowly. </p><p> “Jake!” called Ike Richards warningly.</p><p> The negro gave his mellow, throaty laugh</p><p>and relaxed into a crouch. </p><p> “Come on, den, li’l massa. 01’ Jake will</p><p>tickle ribs wid you.” </p><p> Denny came on. He slid past a pair of</p><p>wicked drives at his face until his chin rested </p><p>against Jenkins’s shoulders. The gloves </p><p>drummed against white body and black. </p><p> “Keep away from him! Oh, keep away</p><p>from him!” wailed Skipper Burns. </p><p> But Denny would not keep away. Again</p><p>and again, before the bell rang, he slid in </p><p>under those head blows to offer his body in </p><p>exchange for Jake Jenkins’s. Again and </p><p>again the black thrust him away, and his </p><p>vicious upper-cut just grazed the boy’s </p><p>brow. </p><p> Denny was much embarrassed by the at-</p><p>tentions of his helpers during the rest. Such</p><p>solicitude was entirely new to him. Besides </p><p>it was unnecessary. His daily work with </p><p>Williamson had been just as exacting as this. </p><p> Skipper Burns squatted before him and</p><p>took the boy’s legs upon his thighs and </p><p>kneaded them frantically, as if the whole </p><p>issue depended upon it. </p><p> “Don’t step into him!” he implored.</p><p>“For Gawd’s sake, keep away, Denny. </p><p>He’ll reach your chin yet—and when he </p><p>does—Don’t step into him! We’ve got to </p><p>give the crowd a run for their money.” </p><p> The boy looked down at him with a faint</p><p>smile. He wondered why the Skipper’s fat </p><p>cheeks should shake so and his voice sound </p><p>so thin and dry. Didn’t he know that </p><p>Jake Jenkins was hollow? Or was that just </p><p>his own and Saunders’s secret? </p><p> The bell rang. Silence fell.</p><p> “Here I is, li’l massa.”</p><p> Shoulders hunched, the boy rocked in.</p><p> The second round was like the first, the</p><p>third like the precedingjtwo. </p><p>The White Hope’s Understudy </p><p>145 </p><p> For Denny the negro had no head. For</p><p>him there was only that black barrel, which </p><p>was hollow. And the boy might as well </p><p>have had no head also, for all it availed </p><p>Jake Jenkins. Always his steel-spring blows </p><p>met those lifted hands, always that parting </p><p>upper-cut just grazed Denny’s brow, or </p><p>flicked the little lock of blond hair that fell </p><p>over it. </p><p> Jenkins was meeting with his very own</p><p>defense, executed as perfectly as he himself </p><p>had ever executed it. They met and </p><p>drummed against each other’s ribs, parted </p><p>and met again. </p><p> Three rounds, and neither man visibly</p><p>marked. But there had been plenty of </p><p>action, and the crowd exhaled a vast sigh </p><p>of content. </p><p> Jenkins continued to smile, to joke. He</p><p>joked with the referee, with the men in his </p><p>corner, with friends at the ring-side, with </p><p>Denny. The latter answered never a word. </p><p>He rocked in, pressed his chin against that </p><p>black shoulder, drove his fists into that </p><p>black body, always just below the arch of </p><p>the breastbone! </p><p> “Jes’ look at li’l massa hittin’ ol’ Jake!</p><p>Why, son, you ought-a be arrested for pickin’ </p><p>on er ol’ man lak Jake. What you tryin’ </p><p>to do—cave him in?” </p><p> And then Denny spoke his only word dur-</p><p>ing the entire fight. </p><p> “Yes,” he said.</p><p> The negro’s gums just showed for a mo-</p><p>ment. </p><p> “Three rounds! That ain’t so bad,”</p><p>grumbled Burns, as he pummeled Denny’s </p><p>legs. “And you feel all right, don’t you, </p><p>kid? You’ll last, won’t you?” he implored </p><p>tearfully. “And don’t let him get to your </p><p>chin! He’s been cornin’ so close it makes my </p><p>heart stop dead.” </p><p> Denny wondered. Why shouldn’t he</p><p>feel all right? Body blows—what were </p><p>they? They only made his skin feel warm. </p><p>And all this talk about his chin! He wasn’t</p><p>aware that Jenkins had been driving at it </p><p>continually. He couldn’t remember having </p><p>tried to guard it. </p><p> Nor had he consciously tried to protect</p><p>his chin any more than he had consciously </p><p>avoided those blows to his face as he rocked </p><p>in under Jenkins’s guard. All his defense </p><p>had been subconscious, without effort of </p><p>will on his part, the result, probably, of </p><p>some supersensitive instinct. All his will </p><p>and his brain were focused upon one pur- </p><p>10 </p><p>pose—to reach Jenkins’s hollow body and </p><p>cave it in. </p><p> He was as little aware of the real animus</p><p>directing this purpose as he was with the </p><p>details of his defense. He knew he hated </p><p>Jenkins with a cold, consuming hatred, but </p><p>he hardly knew why, unless it was because </p><p>he had seen hatred of the black in Saunders’s </p><p>dark blue eyes. That, too, was instinctive, </p><p>the instinctive hatred of the clean for the </p><p>sullied, of the humanized for the brute. </p><p> Now and then, looking over the negro’s</p><p>glistening shoulder, his eyes met Saunders’s </p><p>eyes. That look ever gave him a fresh im- </p><p>petus. </p><p> He thought he wanted to cave Jenkins in</p><p>because Saunders had told him to; he did </p><p>not dream the reason was a far loftier one </p><p>than the desire of one man. How could an </p><p>ignorant mine boy be expected to know that </p><p>he was impregnated with the same vicious </p><p>zeal that animated the Puritan and the </p><p>Jesuit? </p><p> The fourth round was like the third—the</p><p>second, the first—the same but more of it. </p><p>Jenkins, ever laughing, ever joking, showed </p><p>a certain reluctance about closing in, and </p><p>that reluctance only fired Denny to greater </p><p>insistence. He would not be denied. The </p><p>black could not avoid him, he could not beat </p><p>him off. Rocking, gliding, he slipped in </p><p>under a fruitless volley to the head. </p><p> Jenkins had no choice but fight according</p><p>to the other’s choosing. He had to fight </p><p>back or go into a clinch; and his childish </p><p>conceit would not allow of that. What </p><p>would be said if he, the champion, were seen </p><p>to be holding on because of Dennis Boone,</p><p>a mere tyro? There were fifteen thousand </p><p>people out there, some of whom had seen </p><p>him batter down the best, all of whom had </p><p>heard of it. There were newspaper men— </p><p>friends and satellites!—his wife! </p><p> He did not clinch. When he could no</p><p>longer keep the boy off, he met him shoulder </p><p>to shoulder, trading body for body. Jake </p><p>Jenkins was no coward; only he was hol- </p><p>low. </p><p> His laugh rang out as mellowly, his jokes</p><p>flew as fast. </p><p> “Li’l massa, seems to me you is sittin’ up</p><p>mighty late. Ain’t it about yo’ bedtime, </p><p>li’l massa? I reckon ol’ Jake had better </p><p>rock dis baby to sleep purty soon.” </p><p> Denny said nothing. He rocked, he glid-</p><p>ed in, he drove at that arch below the breast- </p><p>bone. There was something inevitable </p><p>146 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>about it. Now when his blows landed he </p><p>could hear little short pants issue from the </p><p>negro’s mouth, close by his ear. Now he </p><p>discovered that that black body was elastic, </p><p>began to give a little under his blows. </p><p> “Four rounds,” croaked Burns, with a</p><p>falsetto laugh. “If I do say so, Denny, </p><p>you’re doin’-fine. There ain’t many that </p><p>could trade with Jake and last four rounds. </p><p>How you save your chin I dunno.” </p><p> They were drenching Denny with water,</p><p>fanning him with towels, spluttering advice </p><p>in his ear. </p><p> Suddenly he turned his head. He was</p><p>not surprised to find Saunders’s eyes waiting </p><p>for his. Very slowly he nodded, and Denny </p><p>nodded back. That one glance seemed to </p><p>convey perfect understanding. </p><p> The gong rang. The crowd grew hushed.</p><p>The fighters advanced, rocking, crouching. </p><p> “Gettin’ close to by-by time, li’l massa.</p><p>Come to yo’ ol’ Jake’s arms.” </p><p> Denny came swiftly. He slid past Jen-</p><p>kins’s blows, and refused to be ousted. His </p><p>arms worked as regularly as a machine, </p><p>Jenkins’s arms likewise. </p><p> And then, without warning, the black’s</p><p>body was pressed against his, the black’s </p><p>arms circled and pressed down his arms. </p><p>The champion had clinched at last! </p><p> Denny strained backward, but still Jen-</p><p>kins clung to him. Their cheeks scraped </p><p>moistly, and then the eye of one was looking </p><p>into the eye of the other, close, very close, </p><p>unclouded blue eye looking into mottled </p><p>brown. And the brown fell. </p><p> The champion thrust Denny away and</p><p>sprang back. His crouch became accentu- </p><p>ated, his arms folded across his stomach. </p><p> “I’se quit funnin’ wid you! You hear?”</p><p> Denny said nothing. He rocked forward.</p><p>Like an animal Jenkins sprang and struck</p><p>and struck again. But glove met only </p><p>glove. Denny slipped through the blows as </p><p>water slips through one’s fingers. His chin </p><p>rested on the black shoulder, his hands al- </p><p>ternated upon that one spot just below the </p><p>breastbone. </p><p> Jenkins thrust him away, crouched,</p><p>sprang and struck. Inside crept Denny, </p><p>jabbing, jabbing. </p><p> Again the negro thrust him away, but this</p><p>time he did not spring. He crouched, waiting. </p><p> “Watch him!” wailed Skipper Burns.</p><p>“Keep away from him!” </p><p> But Denny would not keep away. The</p><p>grin was frozen to Jenkins’s face. He looked </p><p>as he had looked at the start. Only Denny </p><p>knew, for he had felt that black body giving </p><p>more and more, and the pants issuing close </p><p>to his ear had been like low, hurt cries. He </p><p>glided in and struck. </p><p> Suddenly, as before, the black’s body was</p><p>pressed against his, Jenkins’s arms circled </p><p>his arms. But they did not cling. They </p><p>began to slide down. </p><p> They slid to Denny’s elbows, to his wrists.</p><p>It was very still. The negro’s wailing cry </p><p>slit through the silence like a knife-blade </p><p>through paper. </p><p> “O—Lawdy!”</p><p> His arms slipped to Denny’s thighs and</p><p>clung a moment. Now they were around </p><p>the boy’s knees. </p><p> Before him Denny saw an arm, an arm</p><p>in a pink-striped shirt-sleeve, outstretched. </p><p>He looked down. Jenkins lay across his </p><p>feet. When he looked up again, the arm in </p><p>the pink-striped shirt-sleeve was rising and </p><p>falling. </p><p> The touch of the negro’s moist flesh</p><p>against his shins was disagreeable, and the </p><p>boy stepped back. Jenkins rolled over </p><p>limply and turned a face hideously drawn </p><p>with pain up to the sunlight. He had been </p><p>caved in. </p><p> Denny looked up with the ghost of a</p><p>smile to find the world-famous referee star- </p><p>ing at him with what almost amounted to</p><p>horror. </p><p> “I knew I would do it,” he said simply.</p><p> “Huh!” croaked the referee. “You knew</p><p>it? Kid, do you realize you’ve knocked </p><p>out Jake Jenkins—in five rounds?” </p><p> “Sure; he was hollow.”</p><p> “And that you’re—champion of the</p><p>world?” </p><p> “Huh?” said Denny in his turn.</p><p> He looked about him dazedly. Champion!</p><p>He became aware of all those faces and </p><p>all those eyes, of a terrifying volume of </p><p>sound. He had to brace his feet wide </p><p>apart; he had to grasp at that arm in </p><p>the pink-striped shirt-sleeve to keep from </p><p>falling. </p><p> Champion of the world! The thought</p><p>had never entered his head. </p><p> And just because the thought had never</p><p>entered his head is the big reason why- </p><p> But we will leave that to the moralists.</p><p>Author of “The Snow Burner’’ “The Man Trail’’, etc. </p><p> SYNOPSIS—Havens Falls is one of the last lumber settlements on the St. Croix River, Wisconsin. In</p><p>it, one faction, led by Devil Dave Taggart, lumber king, is working to keep the town lawless so that decent </p><p>people, who might investigate his timber operations, will not live there. </p><p> Richard Hale, Dr. Sanders, and Rose Ilavetis lead the respectable element. But they are losing out,</p><p>when into the settlement flies Gaston Olaf Francois Thorson, a fighting young giant, of French-Norse de- </p><p>scent, with his partner, Tom Pine. Gaston saves Miss Havens from the insults of “Red-Skirl” Murphy, </p><p>leader and driver of Taggart’s lumbermen, who are derelicts from every camp in the North, working under </p><p>Devil Dave’s wing, since he will protect them from the law. Gaston whips Murphy in a saloon, which forces </p><p>Rose Havens to believe him a common brawler. Gaston is bewildered and angry at this. </p><p> Gaston hires out to Taggart as boss in Murphy's place. He finds the timber tract about to be cut sus-</p><p>piciously well guarded by Taggart's men; also that back in the woods Devil Dave has a fine house, where </p><p>live two women who carouse with him, and who, he tells Gaskin Olaf, are his sister and niece. </p><p> Gaston decides Taggart’s is no white man’s outfit. He and Tom Pine leave it. On their way to Havens</p><p>Falls they come upon Hale, who, while trying to approach Taggart’s timber territory, has been shot in the </p><p>leg. They rush him to the settlement. There Gaston learns that Devil Dave is really stealing timber owned </p><p>by Rose Havens. And he has been aiding in the theft! Gaston goes over to the side of Miss Havens. </p><p> When Taggart sends the stolen logsdown-stream that Spring, Gaston captures them all for Rose Havens,</p><p>after a desperate fight. Whereupon Taggart claims he innocently cut her lumber and pays her $25,000 cash </p><p>for the mistake. He then accuses Gaston of shooting his henchman Murphy and orders him to leave the </p><p>country. </p><p> Gaston leaves, but returns secretly to Havens Falls in time to prevent Murphy, supposedly wounded,</p><p>from stealing back the $25,000 from Miss Havens, at the instigation of Taggart. Murphy, however, escapes, </p><p>and Taggart vanishes. A capitalist, Lonergan, arrives at the Falls. He plans to build a railroad through </p><p>the St. Croix country and open the land for settlers. But first Taggart’s gang must be cleaned out. Gaston </p><p>is made Town Marshal. He plans to throttle lawlessness at its source; so, with Tom Pine, he strikes back </p><p>into the woods after Taggarl who has taken refuge in his forest house. </p><p>CHAPTER XXVII	“The old devil isn’t taking any chances</p><p>tacgart’s oh a no f	even out here in the woods ” whispered</p><p> TAGGART s CHANCE	Gaston. “Come on!”</p><p> •HEN darkness had fallen suffi- As they moved into the clearing, an owl</p><p> ciently to hide their movements, hooted: “Hoo, hoo, hoo!” from beside the</p><p> they slipped down to the edge house.</p><p>of the clearing.

They </p><p>were in the doorway, their rifle-muzzles </p><p>covering the interior; the house was theirs. </p><p>“And you wish—gentlemen?” </p><p> The dark woman whom Gaston had seen</p><p>at his previous visit to the house rose from </p><p>a table; the little blonde looked up, laugh- </p><p>ing. </p><p> “Have some beer?” she tittered, holding</p><p>forth a glass. “Or some trout? You’re just </p><p>in time for supper.” </p><p> Gaston looked at the table. It was set</p><p>for three. </p><p> “Where’s the old man?” He pointed with</p><p>the rifle-barrel at the third plate. </p><p> “Mina,” called the dark woman.</p><p> From the kitchen a greasy squaw came</p><p>forth, and at a signal sat down in the third </p><p>chair. </p><p> “No, you don’t,” cried Gaston. “There’s</p><p>a bottle of champagne there; you aren’t giv- </p><p>ing champagne to squaws.” </p><p> “Serve the wine, Mina,” said the dark</p><p>woman. </p><p> The squaw obediently drew the cork and</p><p>poured a glass for each of the women. </p><p> “And the third glass—how about that?”</p><p> “That’s a mistake.”</p><p> “It is; it gives you away. Tom, you take</p><p>a look around. I’ll watch here.” </p><p> At the word Tom eagerly stormed</p><p>through the house. Gaston could mark his </p><p>progress as he kicked his way from room to </p><p>room, and searched for hiding-places. In </p><p>a few minutes he came running back, carry- </p><p>ing in his hand Taggart’s wide-brimmed </p><p>hat. </p><p> “By the open back window, Gaston Olaf!”</p><p>he cried. “He was here, but he’s gone. </p><p>This was knocked off his head getting </p><p>away.” </p><p> “Hoo-hoo!” hooted the owl outside, now</p><p>farther away. “Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!” </p><p> Gaston and Tom looked at each other in</p><p>disgust. </p><p> “That darn Injun!” growled Tom. “And</p><p>men like me ’n’ you couldn’t tell the differ- </p><p>ence! And we didn’t have sense enough to </p><p>look for a trail leading out behind.” </p><p> “Some wine?” smiled the dark woman,</p><p>holding forth a glass. </p><p> “Or beer?” laughed the blonde. “You</p><p>ought to get something out of your trip.” </p><p>Gaston bowed low, cap in hand, in his </p><p>very best manner. </p><p> “I beg your pardon, ladies. It was a bad</p><p>mistake on our part. We should have </p><p>watched both sides of the house. You may </p><p>tell Mr. Taggart that he was too smart for </p><p>us.” </p><p> “Sit down,” said the dark woman, smiling</p><p>her best. “There’s no use chasing him; he’s </p><p>got away by now. Won’t you have some </p><p>wine?” </p><p> “With the little knockout-drops in? No,</p><p>thanks. You’ve already gained a few min- </p><p>utes for Taggart, though. So we must bid </p><p>you good-by.” </p><p> The little blonde made one bid to hold</p><p>them longer. </p><p> “Geel Big man. I believe I could leave</p><p>Taggart for you.” </p><p> “Good-night. I’m sorry-”</p><p> He saw that the girl was laughing at</p><p>something and glanced toward the open </p><p>window. </p><p> Taggart, standing outside, was leaning</p><p>over the sill, carefully covering Gaston and </p><p>Tom with a double - barreled shot - gun. </p><p>There was no need for speech. Gaston and </p><p>Tom were too experienced to take chances </p><p>with such wicked, business - like eyes as </p><p>gleamed at them over the barrels. It was </p><p>life or death, the decision to be made in a </p><p>split second, and they froze stiff, their rifles </p><p>hanging harmlessly under their arms.</p><p> “That’s right.” Taggart’s fangs showed</p><p>as he smiled. He had been drinking. “A </p><p>move and—well, we won’t speak of what </p><p>would have happened. The—the tables </p><p>are slightly turned, aren’t they, Thorson? </p><p>You’re not the big man just at present. No, </p><p>just now you look like an ordinary whipped </p><p>dog. And, like every dog who gets in my </p><p>way, you’ve had your day.” </p><p> Gaston’s eyes looked down the gun-bar-</p><p>rel into the eyes of Taggart. There in the </p><p>terrible, silent conflict of wills the issue was </p><p>decided. </p><p> “Ah, Taggart! You’ve had your last</p><p>chance to get me out of your way.” Gas- </p><p>ton’s voice rang with the fiber of triumph. </p><p>“Pull that trigger. Touch her off. Blow </p><p>my head off. That’s your only chance. </p><p>And that’s gone now. It was gone the sec- </p><p>ond after you got the drop. You could </p><p>have done it then, while our backs were to </p><p>you. You can’t do it now. Your chance is </p><p>gone—see? You can’t look me in the eye </p><p>and do it. It isn’t in you, Taggart. You’re </p><p>trying, but it won’t work. You’re done for. </p><p>Your chance is gone. I’ll drive you out of </p><p>the country now. Look at his gun wobbling. </p><p>Look! Look!” </p><p>Gaston Olaf </p><p>149 </p><p> Like a flash he threw himself backward,</p><p>knocking Tom Pine under him. His long </p><p>legs flew out, kicking the table smack into </p><p>the window where Taggart stood. </p><p> The shotgun roared ineffectually. The</p><p>big kerosene lamp on the table exploded, </p><p>flirting liquid flame about the room. </p><p> There was a hell’s medley of flame and</p><p>screams, of cursing and scrambling, as the </p><p>women blindly threw themselves about to </p><p>escape the flames. Tom and Gaston thrust </p><p>the women to safety through the open door, </p><p>and running into the next room made their </p><p>escape through a rear window. </p><p> “Into the brush!” commanded Gaston.</p><p>“The Indian’s around somewhere. He’ll </p><p>have a shotgun,too.” </p><p> From a hiding-placc in the brush they</p><p>looked back at the clearing. The cottage </p><p>was spouting flame at every window. The </p><p>clearing was brilliantly illuminated, but the </p><p>light revealed no trace of Taggart or the </p><p>women. Apparently they had fled the mo- </p><p>ment that it was certain that the cottage </p><p>was doomed, not wishing to be found by </p><p>any one whom the flames might draw from </p><p>the woods. </p><p> The same thought was in Gaston’s mind,</p><p>and, when it became apparent that the dan- </p><p>ger from Taggart’s shotgun was passed, he </p><p>caught Tom by the arm and led the way </p><p>into the timber. </p><p> On a ridge a mile away they dropped on</p><p>the ground and lay looking back. Up in </p><p>the dark sky hung a red-tinted pall, the re- </p><p>flection of the burning building. In that </p><p>waste of dead, black forest the scene was </p><p>appalling, an angry splotch of passion in a </p><p>sea of peace. </p><p> Higher and fiercer rose the flames, licking</p><p>eagerly at the rich furnishings of the den, </p><p>and redder and larger grew the glow in the </p><p>sky. The fire rose rapidly to its climax, </p><p>spouted high as the roof fell in, then gradu- </p><p>ally began to subside, while minute by min- </p><p>ute the nightly gloom of the forest crept </p><p>slowly back to its own. </p><p> “Good enough,” said Gaston at last.</p><p>“That’s a good sign. Taggart’s been burnt </p><p>out of one of his dirty nests. May the good </p><p>work go on!” </p><p> Tom Pine was rubbing his brow in per-</p><p>plexity. </p><p> “What happened?” he demanded. “What</p><p>for did you go to rile him up so sud- </p><p>den, Gaston Olaf? We might ’a’ got hurt.” </p><p> “It was our only chance. We had to rat-</p><p>tle him. He got mad; I saw by his eyes that </p><p>he’d loosened his trigger grip. Then I drop- </p><p>ped and kicked the table. I had the thing </p><p>worked out fine.” </p><p> “Pretty fine,” agreed Tom dubiously.</p><p>“That’s the closest I ever heard buck-shot </p><p>whistle past this old head. If it had been </p><p>any finer-” </p><p> “I wouldn’t have made a move,” Gaston</p><p>laughed. “We certainly didn’t come away </p><p>from there with any credit, Tom. Walked </p><p>into it with our eyes wide open and blind.” </p><p>“Ye-es. It wasn’t so bad, though; we </p><p>were able to walk out again. We didn’t take </p><p>anything away, but we didn’t leave any- </p><p>thing, either. Now, what next?” </p><p> “We’ll keep on walking. The chances</p><p>are Taggart’ll have his sheriff and posse out </p><p>here looking for us as soon as he can send </p><p>’em word. They’ll search this neck of the </p><p>woods pretty close, and there’ll be too many </p><p>of ’em for us; so we’ll travel. Come on!” </p><p>He set out, picking his way dexterously </p><p>through the dark woods, at a good pace, </p><p>and Tom followed obediently. The course </p><p>lay straight westward for two miles, to the </p><p>bank of a small creek running north and </p><p>south. </p><p> “Here’s where we lose ’em when they</p><p>come to follow us,” said Gaston and plunged </p><p>into the water. </p><p> Tom followed. They went down-stream</p><p>a short distance and came out upon a sand- </p><p>bar, leaving their tracks large and plain, </p><p>pointing westward. </p><p> After losing their trail in a swamp they</p><p>reentered the creek and waded up-stream for</p><p>half a mile to where a tangled windfall per- </p><p>mitted them to quit the stream, on the </p><p>eastern side, without touching the ground </p><p>and making tracks. Their course now lay </p><p>eastward and slightly to the north. </p><p> They traveled steadily for most of the</p><p>night. Shortly before daybreak they </p><p>searched for and found a small, well-built </p><p>shanty in the midst of a good growth of </p><p>timber. Tom Pine laughed as they entered </p><p>and, by feeling, found matches where they </p><p>had left them the day they started for Ha- </p><p>vens Falls. </p><p> “Home again!” he cried.</p><p> “Yes,” said Gaston. “We’ll lay low on</p><p>our claims here for a couple of days. We’ll </p><p>hit back to town to be there Saturday night.” </p><p>“Saturday night? Why then?” </p><p> “Because then I figure the pot’ll be about</p><p>due to boil over.” </p><p>150 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>CHAPTER XXVin </p><p>SATURDAY NIGHT </p><p>IT WAS drive-time on the La Croix; it </p><p>was pay-day for the camps; and it </p><p>was Saturday night in Havens Falls. </p><p> For such nights existed the river-fronts of</p><p>river towns in the bad old days; on such </p><p>nights was made the lurid history that is </p><p>remembered even now, when river towns, </p><p>as they were, have ceased to exist. Mad, </p><p>glorious nights after sober days of bone- </p><p>testing toil. </p><p> No one who has seen a river town on such</p><p>a night will ever forget it, even though the </p><p>recollection is accompanied by a shudder. </p><p>Then the men came in off the drive, wet </p><p>with the water which had snatched at their </p><p>lives during the day, mad with the hunger </p><p>for a night’s excitement before going back </p><p>to their toil. Then from out of the woods </p><p>came the camp-men in bodily condition like </p><p>unto a prize-fighter in training, mentally </p><p>akin to bucks in rutting time, prowling </p><p>about for a chance to fight. There assem- </p><p>bled on such occasions dozens of the most </p><p>daring, reckless, muscular men who ever in- </p><p>habited this continent. In their pockets </p><p>they carried money running often into the </p><p>hundreds. </p><p> To the right and left the red lights blink-</p><p>ed, and music tinkled, advertising the things </p><p>that the river-front had to give in exchange </p><p>for money. Supply follows the demand. </p><p>Whisky and women; lights and music; gam- </p><p>bling and association with their kind; noise </p><p>and strife—these were the things that the </p><p>excitement-hungry woodsmen craved, and </p><p>these were the things that the river-front </p><p>brazenly announced itself ready to supply. </p><p> In a mud-chinked log building, with trees</p><p>swaying at its back door, one found a gleam- </p><p>ing, polished dancefloor, where, by stand- </p><p>ing in line, and for a price, one might dance </p><p>with a tiny blonde, with the features of a </p><p>Madonna and the eyes of a snake. In the </p><p>curtained boxes lumber-jacks had the privi- </p><p>lege of ordering the same brands of cham- </p><p>pagne that wine - agents advertise along </p><p>Broadway.</p><p> Old lumber-jacks, mackinawed and shoe-</p><p>packed, beards reeking with tobacco-juice, </p><p>but pockets filled with money, staggered </p><p>about the floor, holding in their arms girls </p><p>young enough to be their daughters. Young </p><p>jacks, slim, clean-eyed boys, spent their </p><p>money on painted things old enough to be </p><p>their mothers. </p><p> Next door one could gamble at anything</p><p>from chuck-luck to roulette. Any lumber- </p><p>jack who by accident won a few dollars, cal- </p><p>culated to hold his winnings by the strength </p><p>of his good right arm. </p><p> But these devices of pleasure were but</p><p>supplements to whisky. It was the bars </p><p>over which liquor was served that drew the </p><p>men and furnished reasons for the other </p><p>things; and it was in the bare saloons that </p><p>the greatest crowds were to be found and </p><p>the most violent actions indulged in. </p><p> On this Saturday night, while Gaston and</p><p>Tom Pine were wending their way to town, </p><p>there were probably a hundred and fifty </p><p>men from the woods in Havens Falls. Jack </p><p>McCarthy’s saloon, being the largest in the </p><p>settlement, drew the largest part of this </p><p>number. </p><p> McCarthy was experienced in such occa-</p><p>sions, and he knew that serious rows were </p><p>no source of profit to his till. Hence, early </p><p>in the evening, he seated himself on a stool </p><p>just inside the door. Twenty-five per cent, </p><p>of the lumber-jacks came into town bearing </p><p>rifles. As such a one entered McCarthy’s </p><p>place the proprietor crooked a finger and </p><p>pointed at a corner behind the bar. The </p><p>lumber-jack promptly placed his weapon </p><p>with the others deposited there. There </p><p>were twoscore rifles behind McCarthy’s </p><p>bar that night before the fun had fairly be- </p><p>gun. </p><p> Gaston and Tom entered the settlement</p><p>shortly after dark and at once made their </p><p>way unobserved into Dr. Sanders’s back </p><p>room. The doctor greeted them with great </p><p>surprise and greater relief. </p><p> “Boys—boys! I’d almost lost hope of</p><p>seeing you again.” </p><p> “Why so?”</p><p> “For good and sufficient reasons. First,</p><p>because of the way you disappeared with- </p><p>out leaving any word. That worried me, </p><p>but I figured you might have done that for </p><p>a reason. But when the sheriff and his </p><p>gang went hunting you-” </p><p> “Oh! They did hunt for us, then?”</p><p> “Hunt for you? Boys, they certainly did.</p><p>They made a sudden raid on the hotel, sur- </p><p>rounded it and forced their way in. You </p><p>were gone. As near as I could figure it </p><p>you’d been gone about twenty minutes when </p><p>the raid came. Then they searched the </p><p>town. They-” </p><p>Gaston Olaf </p><p> “Did they go up there?” Gaston nodded</p><p>in the direction of the Havens home. </p><p> “They did. Miss Rose invited the sheriff</p><p>to go through and see that you weren’t </p><p>hiding there. She told him you wouldn’t </p><p>hide from a man like him. Yes, they went </p><p>through the whole town. </p><p> “Then that night they got word and went</p><p>into the bush after you. I heard that they’d </p><p>heard where you were. Then they came </p><p>back and said they’d run you out of the </p><p>country, and boys, I was—hm, hm—I was </p><p>afraid they’d caught you and put you out </p><p>of business. And, say, somebody else was </p><p>worrying, too, and I think you ought to </p><p>show yourself up there as soon as you can.” </p><p>“All right. And what’s happened since </p><p>then?” </p><p>“Oh, the sheriff and most of his gang </p><p>have gone back to La Croix. But the crowd </p><p>that’s in town tonight—hm, hm—there’ll </p><p>be Billy the Devil to pay before morning.” </p><p>“What’s up?” </p><p> “Well, the crew that you took the drive</p><p>away frofh has been trying to clean out the </p><p>town. The rest of the men have been giv- </p><p>ing them the laugh. There are a lot of men </p><p>in town who haven’t any use for Taggart, </p><p>although they’ve been in his camps. </p><p>There’s the crew from Camp One, forty men </p><p>or more, just paid off. They’ve heard about </p><p>what you did to that drive, and Taggart </p><p>can’t show himself without getting the </p><p>merry ha-ha! There have been half a dozen </p><p>small riots already. Taggart’s bullies have </p><p>been trying to choke off the fellows who </p><p>dare to talk about how you took the drive.” </p><p>“Have they been able to do it?” asked </p><p>Gaston with great interest. </p><p> “Not much! There are too many of the</p><p>other fellows. But the bullies have turned </p><p>to this end of town. Red-Shirt Murphy </p><p>knocked a kid down and robbed him across </p><p>the street there just a few minutes ago.” </p><p>“Red Shirt, eh? And Taggart—what’s </p><p>he up to?” </p><p> “Hm, hm. He’s keeping himself hidden.</p><p>But—whisper—the old man’s been drink- </p><p>ing his head off these last two days, and he’s </p><p>egging his bullies on.” </p><p> “Fine!” laughed Gaston.</p><p> “What?”</p><p> “Fine! Then the chances are that old</p><p>Davy will try to do something tonight to </p><p>still the laughter and make people remem- </p><p>ber that he’s still the boss man along the </p><p>La Croix.” </p><p> “That’s just how we figure it.”</p><p> “And Red-Shirt Murphy has committed</p><p>a crime. Were there any witnesses?” </p><p> “Half a dozen.”</p><p> “Fine again. I’m marshal of Havens</p><p>Falls; it’s my duty to arrest any one who </p><p>commits a crime. Murphy will be the first </p><p>victim of law and order in Havens Falls.” </p><p> “Man, dear! On a night like this-”</p><p> “Just the time. The way to break a jam</p><p>is to break her when she’s keyed up tight- </p><p>est.” </p><p> He moved toward the door, the rear door,</p><p>for the time to reveal himself to the settle- </p><p>ment had not arrived. </p><p> “You wait here for me a few minutes,</p><p>Tom,” he said easily. </p><p> “Nix. You don’t go, leaving me out of</p><p>any of this fun,” protested Tom. </p><p> “The fun doesn’t start just yet. I’ve—</p><p>I’ve got something else to do just now.” </p><p>“Yes—hm, hm,” said the doctor. “She’ll </p><p>be glad to see that you’re back.” </p><p>ggZjtb' GASTON went directly to the Ha- </p><p>JjSp vens house. It was a warm, dark </p><p>*	night and in his rubber - soled</p><p>shoes he made no more noise than a cat as </p><p>he came swiftly up to the door. The door </p><p>was open, as was a window at one side. </p><p> The front room was brightly lighted and</p><p>Gaston could not help looking in, and hav- </p><p>ing looked could not help hearing what was </p><p>being said. It halted him, and he stood </p><p>looking and listening. </p><p> Hale was in the room with Rose and Mrs.</p><p>Havens. Hale was on his feet, speaking, </p><p>and his strong, round face wore a look of </p><p>worry. </p><p> “I think you ought to go. If I had the</p><p>power I would make you go. This is no </p><p>time for you to stay here.” </p><p> “Are you going away, too?” asked Rose.</p><p>“Of course not. That’s different. But </p><p>there’s no reason why you should stay. We </p><p>can’t tell what they’ll do before morning. </p><p>I’ll give you my team and a driver and you </p><p>can go down to La Croix and wait until the </p><p>thing blows over.” </p><p> Rose smiled.</p><p> “If you will drive us, Dick-”</p><p> “Oh, you know I can’t do that. A man</p><p>can’t run away.” </p><p> “But a woman—a girl—can?”</p><p>“Certainly. That’s common sense.” </p><p>“We’re going to stay here, Dick.” Rose </p><p>was very quiet. “I know how well you </p><p>152 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>mean it—but we will not run away.” </p><p>“Bravo!” cried Gaston, striding in. They </p><p>started at the sight of him; but Gaston </p><p>looked only at Rose, and his heart swelled </p><p>at the look she gave him. “I apologize for </p><p>hearing what wasn’t intended for my ears. </p><p>I was just coming in. Miss Havens, with </p><p>you here we know we must keep Taggart’s </p><p>outfit away from this end of town; and if </p><p>we must, we can.” </p><p> He laughed as he spoke. His spirits were</p><p>at top crest. The situation, the opportunity </p><p>to fight to protect Rose, was like wine to </p><p>his blood. It lifted him, made his heart </p><p>beat madly. He felt strong enough to fight </p><p>the world; he had a mad impulse to go forth </p><p>singing, to battle single-handed with the </p><p>gang in its lairs. </p><p> And then he remembered. Those mad,</p><p>joyous, impractical impulses and actions </p><p>were no longer for him. That was past. </p><p>For him, sober, respectable, practical effort. </p><p> He heaved a sigh as he noted that Rose’s</p><p>eyes were comparing him to Hale. The </p><p>comparison scarcely could be favorable to </p><p>him, he knew. His fringed buckskin trou- </p><p>sers, high-top rubbers, flaming red sash and </p><p>carelessly buttoned shirt were in dire con- </p><p>trast to Hale’s neat store-clothes. In the </p><p>woods, the odds would have been in his </p><p>favor; here it was obviously Hale who had </p><p>the better of it. </p><p> As they questioned him about his ab-</p><p>sence and return, Gaston made a mental </p><p>note that he would change to “town clothes” </p><p>as soon as the opportunity offered. And </p><p>then he must hold himself in, must sup- </p><p>press those reckless impulses, and make </p><p>himself into a regular respectable citizen. </p><p> “I can win her,” whispered Gaston’s in-</p><p>stinct. “But I’ve got to tame myself—I’ve </p><p>got to quiet down.” </p><p> As a beginning he reconsidered his words</p><p>concerning Hale’s suggestion that Rose and </p><p>her mother leave town. </p><p> “Perhaps it would be the right thing to</p><p>do,” he suggested; but Rose laughed at his </p><p>sudden change of front.</p><p> “If we had decided to stay before you</p><p>were here, certainly we won’t change our </p><p>minds now that you’ve come.” </p><p> “Well,” said Gaston dubiously, “I don’t</p><p>know. It’s always best to be safe, and </p><p>you’d surely be safer down at La Croix than </p><p>you are here.” </p><p> Rose thanked him with a look.</p><p> “I’m very glad to hear you talk in that</p><p> tone,” she said, “but I’m sure you don’t</p><p> really think there’s any danger to us here.</p><p> Do you?”</p><p> “As Hale says, you’d surely be safe in La</p><p> Croix,” he replied evasively.</p><p> “But as you said, since we’re going to</p><p> stay here, we'll be assured safety. So here</p><p> we stay.”</p><p> Hale presently excused himself.</p><p> “I want to see Lonergan,” he explained.</p><p> “Hello!” exclaimed Gaston. “Lonergan</p><p> here?”</p><p> “Yes. He’s here with half-a-dozen men.</p><p> He’s preparing to lay out his line between</p><p> La Croix and here.”</p><p> “That will help. That means seven more</p><p> men on our side.”</p><p> “Yes. Good men, too. I must tell Loner-</p><p> gan you’re back in town.”</p><p> Gaston left the house soon after Hale,</p><p> and Rose followed him to the gate.</p><p> “Well,” he said in parting, “you see I’m</p><p> living up to my promise to change my ways.</p><p> I ran away and hid when the sheriff’s gang</p><p> was after me, and I’ve been avoiding trouble</p><p> ever since.”</p><p> “I am glad,” she said.</p><p> “So am I. I’m glad that—that you want-</p><p> ed me to change.”</p><p> Without thinking what he did, his fingers</p><p> strayed down and reached her hand. But</p><p> at the thrill that went through them both</p><p> at the touch, he came to himself and drew</p><p> his hand away. He had no right to do that,</p><p> or think of it—yet.</p><p> “Good night,” he said suddenly. “I must</p><p> go.”</p><p> “Promise me you’ll be careful this eve-</p><p> ning? That you won’t do anything—wild?”</p><p> “Nothing wild,” he said solemnly.</p><p> “That’s all over. I’ll prove to you that it</p><p> is. Don’t you believe it is?”</p><p> “I hope — yes, I believe it is. Good</p><p> night.”</p><p> “Good night, and—I’ll remember.”</p><p> He meant it. He really felt that he was</p><p> tamed. But he was soon to learn how bad-</p><p> ly he was mistaken.</p><p>CHAPTER XXIX </p><p>A FIGHT </p><p>AS GASTON went back toward Dr. </p><p> Sanders’s office there came up from the</p><p> river-front a muffled roar of rage and disap-</p><p> pointment that froze him in his tracks, and</p><p>Gaston Olaf </p><p>153 </p><p> he stood looking down toward where men</p><p> surged wildly to and fro in the gleam of the</p><p> lights from opened windows and doors.</p><p> Something had happened down there that</p><p> had brought sudden anger to a large num-</p><p> ber of the crowd.</p><p> The shouting came from one of the larger</p><p>saloons, and after the first sudden explosion </p><p>of anger there followed an insistent clamor, </p><p>apparently for revenge. </p><p> Ever since he had heard from Dr. San-</p><p>ders that a large percentage of the men in </p><p>town were laughing at Taggart and his gang, </p><p>and that the gang was growling over it, Gas- </p><p>ton had been imbued with a wild hope: if </p><p>the two elements would get to fighting each </p><p>other, the gang would be too busy to turn </p><p>seriously on the decent people of the town. </p><p>He had just promised Rose that he would </p><p>be careful; and to stand to one side and let </p><p>the two sides fight among themselves was </p><p>the height of caution. </p><p> At first he had planned to go down and</p><p>arrest Red-Shirt Murphy before the eyes of </p><p>his friends, casting the challenge of law and </p><p>order in their teeth. But this would inevi- </p><p>tably have precipitated a conflict between </p><p>the gang and the decent citizens. So now </p><p>as he moVed alone down toward the river- </p><p>front, without troubling to call for Tom, it </p><p>was in his mind only to conduct'a secret </p><p>scouting expedition and ascertain, if possi- </p><p>ble, whether there was a prospect that the </p><p>two elements in the crowd would clash in </p><p>battle. If so, he and the other respectable </p><p>citizens of Havens Falls had only to hold </p><p>themselves to their upper part of town and </p><p>pray that the outsiders would lick Tag- </p><p>gart’s men to the last whisper. </p><p> In this cautious frame of mind, Gaston,</p><p>aided by the dark night, soon was mingling </p><p>with the crowd before the building whence </p><p>came the clamor. </p><p> “What’s the row here, neighbor?” he</p><p>asked, keeping his face averted from the </p><p>stranger whom he addressed. </p><p> “Oh, he just knocked another of our boys</p><p>colder’n a dead fish,” was the nonchalant </p><p>reply.</p><p> “Who did?” asked Gaston carelessly.</p><p> Before his informant could reply there</p><p>came a shout from the doorway. </p><p> “Gangway there—gangway! Open up, so</p><p>he can get some air.” </p><p> Shouldering and cursing, their faces cold</p><p>and ugly with rage, came two middle-aged </p><p>woodsmen dragging between them the limp, </p><p>bloody figure of a curly-headed youth. The </p><p>boy was nearly as big as Gaston. The two </p><p>men carried him, each holding him up by </p><p>the arms, his head rolling drunkenly, his </p><p>feet dragging helplessly on the ground. His </p><p>face was smashed red and raw, and there </p><p>was a cruel gash in the back of his head. </p><p>Outside the crowd, which only glanced at </p><p>him and turned away to view what was go- </p><p>ing on in the saloon, they laid him down </p><p>and splashed water in his face. There were </p><p>half a dozen in the circle about him, tried, </p><p>hard-bitten men of the woods, and Gaston </p><p>saw that they were all strangers to him. </p><p> “He’s got his gloves loaded,” muttered</p><p>the battered youth, as consciousness re- </p><p>turned. “I tell you there’s lead in those </p><p>gloves of his.” </p><p> “Shut up!” commanded one of the men</p><p>who had carried him out. “Doesn’t make </p><p>any difference if there was dynamite in ’em; </p><p>we said we could find a man to lick him. </p><p>Boys,” he turned to the little group, “how </p><p>about it? Are we going to let that dam </p><p>prize-fighter brag about licking three of our </p><p>boys without anybody getting him?” </p><p>“Lemme go back at him!” pleaded the </p><p>youth. “I was half stewed when I got into </p><p>the ring with him. Head’s cleared now; I </p><p>can handle him now, boys.” </p><p> “You can’t handle yourself—lay downl</p><p>You handled your mitts like a Swede.” </p><p>“We got to get him licked,” growled an- </p><p>other man. “We can’t hold up our heads </p><p>if we don’t.” </p><p> Gaston’s blood leaped quickly. Forgot-</p><p>ten was the new policy of caution. Here </p><p>was a chance to win Crew One as his de- </p><p>voted followers! </p><p> “Well, rustle around,” continued the</p><p>spokesman. “Get some one. Who can we </p><p>get? Tim Blake, he’s licked, and Big Ro- </p><p>bideau, and—Erik here.” </p><p> “Them’s the best men from our crew.”</p><p>“Well, somebody else, then. Holy, suf- </p><p>fering Moses! Anybody. Let’s go hunt </p><p>for some one.” </p><p> They started back toward the crowd.</p><p> “Hold on, boys.”</p><p> They swung back. Gaston had stepped</p><p>out of the darkness and was standing beside </p><p>the fallen youth. With one glance of their </p><p>sharp eyes those woodsmen appraised him. </p><p>Then they came toward him, respectfully, </p><p>eagerly. </p><p> “What’s going on, boys?” asked Gaston.</p><p>“Some champion in town?” </p><p>154 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> They looked him over in silence.</p><p>“Stranger,” exploded their spokesman, </p><p>“can you handle your mitts at all?” </p><p> “Have done so,” replied Gaston.</p><p>“What’s up?” </p><p> “A knocker-out in Sam’s Place. A pro-</p><p>fessional. Bets any amount he can knock </p><p>out any man in two rounds. He’s cleaned </p><p>three of our boys so far.” </p><p> “Where you from, neighbor?” queried an-</p><p>other voice. </p><p> “Don’t make no difference where he’s</p><p>from,” cried the spokesman. “Question is: </p><p>will you take a whirl at this loud guy?” </p><p>“Oh, I don’t mind,” said Gaston. </p><p> “Then he’s one of our crew—Crew One—</p><p>no matter where he’s from. Come on. </p><p>Gangway there, you town hoboes. We got </p><p>a man to clean your champion now. Come </p><p>on, boys!” </p><p> Gaston paused to bend over the battered</p><p>youth. </p><p> “How did he give you that clip in the</p><p>back of the head, boy?” he asked. </p><p> “Loaded gloves, I tell you,” insisted the</p><p>boy. “I can tell when lead hits me, can’t </p><p>I?” </p><p> “Lead nothing,” said some one. “He lets</p><p>you feel of his gloves. But he strikes an </p><p>awful blow, stranger. The boys have drop- </p><p>ped like they was shot.” </p><p> “All right.”</p><p> They were at the doorway of the saloon</p><p>now. The place was crowded with men. </p><p>At the farther end of the room was a tiny </p><p>stage, on which usually singers and dancers </p><p>held forth. Tonight two ropes were stretch- </p><p>ed across the front of the stage. The two </p><p>side walls and a canvas drop at the back </p><p>constituted the other three sides of the ring. </p><p> Through the haze of tobacco - smoke,</p><p>which hung like clouds about the hanging </p><p>oil-lamps, Gaston could make out the figure</p><p>of the fighter leaning over the ropes, gloves </p><p>on his hands, sneering at the crowd, while </p><p>at his side a hawk-nosed gambler cried: </p><p>“Come on, boys; bring up your fighting </p><p>men! Even money, any amount, you </p><p>haven’t got a man can stay two three-min- </p><p>ute rounds with the ‘Butcher Boy.’ He </p><p>only weighs a hundred sixty-five, boys. </p><p>Come on, some of you fire-eaters; get the </p><p>easy money.” </p><p> Gaston looked over the crowd first of all.</p><p>He recognized here and there one of Tag- </p><p>gart’s men, Red-Shirt Murphy among them, </p><p>but to his satisfaction he saw that more </p><p>than half of the men were strangers to him. </p><p>They were the outsiders, the men who had </p><p>laughed at Taggart because of the trick of </p><p>the stolen drive, and just at present they </p><p>were begging for somebody to step up and </p><p>knock that guy’s block off. </p><p> The men who were to be counted as Tag-</p><p>gart’s were with the pugilist. It was their </p><p>turn to laugh now, and they were taunting </p><p>the outsiders with the failure of their would- </p><p>be champions. </p><p> “Get a good man!” they sneered.</p><p>“What’s the matter, Crew One? Haven’t </p><p>you got one good man among you?” </p><p> The air of the room was heavy with ten-</p><p>sion. The outsiders were taking these </p><p>taunts in ominous silence. </p><p> Gaston looked at the prize-fighter last of</p><p>all. The man was of medium height with </p><p>enormous neck and shoulders and a small </p><p>shaved head. His thick, gnarled arms and </p><p>bowed legs told of great strength, but it </p><p>seemed rather the slow, heavy strength of </p><p>the wrestler than the speed and power of </p><p>the pugilist. </p><p> “What’s the matter? Haven’t you got a</p><p>good man?” howled the fighter’s partisans. </p><p> “You darn know it!” came back the re-</p><p>ply from the door, and Gaston Olaf and his </p><p>six new-found friends came rushing down </p><p>the room to the ring. </p><p> In a vague, far-away sort of fashion Gas-</p><p>ton Olaf realized that he had taken upon </p><p>himself a desperate venture. A small, still </p><p>voice was whispering to him that this was</p><p>a dangerous thing to do; that Taggart’s men </p><p>would recognize him; that they would seek </p><p>to collect the price which he knew Taggart </p><p>must have set on his head. </p><p> But the voice was so small that he scarce-</p><p>ly heard it; the realization of danger came </p><p>to him from far away and as through a fog. </p><p>What he realized keenly was that his veins </p><p>were throbbing with excitement. And now </p><p>under the spur of the moment he realized </p><p>that this was what his nature craved above </p><p>all things, that he had stepped into his </p><p>present dangerous position because his real </p><p>nature had led him to it. </p><p> These thoughts came and went in one</p><p>troubled flash. Then he was the old reck- </p><p>less, dare-devil Gaston, glorying in the pow- </p><p>er of his young giant’s body, thrilled to the </p><p>core by the prospect of the fight ahead of </p><p>him. He laughed boyishly; he was happy. </p><p> There was a moment of stillness as he</p><p>climbed through the ropes. Taggart’s men, </p><p>Gaston Olaf </p><p>155 </p><p>recognizing him, were awed to silence by </p><p>his audacity at appearing in such a place. </p><p>Then the outsiders broke into a whoop and </p><p>crowded forward, clamoring to bet what re- </p><p>mained of their rolls on this new champion. </p><p> The pugilist looked Gaston over with a</p><p>horrible grimace, intended for a smile of </p><p>contempt. </p><p> “Deh bigger dey are, deh harder dey fall,”</p><p>he barked. “Give ’im deh mitts, ref’ree. </p><p>He’s in fer an orful tumble, dis guy is. </p><p>Here, feel o’ my gloves, so yah won’t holler </p><p>dere’s lead in ’em when I knock yah cold.” </p><p> Gaston felt of the thin gloves. There was</p><p>no hard substance in them. </p><p> “Here’s yours.”</p><p> The gambler, acting as referee, tossed him</p><p>a pair of thin gloves similar to the pugil- </p><p>ist’s. Gaston was puzzled at the obvious </p><p>confidence of the professional and the gam- </p><p>bler. By their faces the fight was only a </p><p>formality; it was as good as over, with him </p><p>as another victim of the pug’s prowess. </p><p>Why was this? His keenly alert instinct </p><p>suddenly cried out a warning. There was </p><p>something wrong here; he must be on guard </p><p>against a trick. </p><p> “Come on!” bellowed the gambler. “Any-</p><p>body else want to back the big fellow against </p><p>the little Butcher Boy?” </p><p> Gaston, leaning against the ropes in his</p><p>corner, was watching the crowd. He saw </p><p>Red-Shirt Murphy whispering with another </p><p>man. </p><p> “Come on!” he cried. “Let’s get start-</p><p>ed.” </p><p> “Hi! D’you know who that big stiff is?”</p><p>cried the man to whom Murphy had spoken. </p><p> “Don’t know and don’t care,” replied the</p><p>fighter. </p><p> “That’s Thorson—that’s the guy who</p><p>stole the drive!” </p><p> The room was still for an instant. Then</p><p>Gaston’s backers lifted the roof with their </p><p>shout. </p><p> “Hoop-la! Thorson! Bully boy! Clean</p><p>him up like you cleaned Devil Dave. Eat </p><p>’im alive!” </p><p> The pugilist grinned, and the gambler</p><p>looked bored. It was apparent that they </p><p>cared not in the least about who Gaston </p><p>was; all comers looked alike to them. What </p><p>could the trick be that made them so con- </p><p>fident? </p><p> Gaston looked swiftly around the ring.</p><p>The ropes in front were all right; there could </p><p>be no trick there. The sides were bare </p><p>walls, all right. The rear was a sheet of </p><p>canvas- </p><p> Gaston felt a slight chill along his spine</p><p>and his breath came sharply. There were </p><p>two tiny holes cut in the curtain, so tiny </p><p>that in the poor light it required eyes as </p><p>sharp as his to see them. And for a flash </p><p>as he looked, then instantly disappearing, </p><p>there showed behind each hole a watching </p><p>eye. </p><p> “Something wrong behind that curtain,”</p><p>Gaston mused. “I’ll keep away from it.” </p><p>His thrill at the prospect of combat sud- </p><p>denly changed and gave place to a cold, </p><p>seething rage. They would try an unfair </p><p>trick on him, would they! His jaw set and </p><p>his eyes flashed fire. </p><p> “Come on, you cheap, dirty crook!” he</p><p>hissed. “I’ll spoil your circus and break </p><p>your head besides.” </p><p> “No more bets? All bets on?”</p><p> “Our money’s all up. Kill him, Thorson,</p><p>eat him alive!” </p><p> “Knock him cold, Butcher Boy!” roared</p><p>Red Shirt. “Then we’ll give it to him </p><p>right.” </p><p> “Go!” shouted the gambler and leaped</p><p>from the ring. </p><p>IKB THE crowd surged forward, pack- </p><p>jjiiiuu ing tightly against the ropes. Gas- </p><p>ton had a flash of the first row, and,</p><p>seeing half a dozen of Taggart’s men there, </p><p>knew that more trouble awaited him when </p><p>the fight was over. </p><p> He had little time to think of this. The</p><p>fighter came at him like a whirlwind. It </p><p>was only a feint. Gaston led, the pug duck- </p><p>ed, and Gaston suddenly found himself </p><p>clinched and shoved toward the curtain. </p><p>He broke the clinch without any trouble. </p><p> The fighter feinted and clinched again.</p><p>This time he had a hold about the middle. </p><p>With a heave he lifted Gaston from the floor </p><p>and rushed him against the canvas hanging. </p><p>Gaston threw himself forward even as his </p><p>back touched the curtain and in that instant </p><p>the secret of the fighter’s success was re- </p><p>vealed to him. A blow as from an ax took </p><p>him on one side of the neck, but his for- </p><p>ward movement had taken him too far </p><p>away to permit the blow to land with full </p><p>force. As it was it knocked him to his </p><p>knees. Stars flew around his head; he felt </p><p>nauseated, for a moment. And then he </p><p>was on his feet, with a berserk bellow of </p><p>rage. </p><p>Adventure </p><p> The pug struck wildly, right and left, and</p><p>turned and ran. Gaston caught him at the </p><p>ropes. He grappled him neck and thigh </p><p>and swung him over his head, roaring deep </p><p>down in his chest. Without a flicker of </p><p>hesitation the gambler reached for his gun, </p><p>only to be dropped by the fists of two Crew </p><p>One men who had been watching him for </p><p>just such action. </p><p> Gaston steadied himself with the squirm-</p><p>ing man held above his head. It was a </p><p>good ten feet across the ring. Gaston hurl- </p><p>ed his victim straight through the air into </p><p>the canvas. The curtain ripped and came </p><p>down, and the two black-jack men behind </p><p>it were exposed with their weapons in their </p><p>hands. </p><p> “There!” cried Gaston. “There’s why</p><p>your men lost, boys!” </p><p>CHAPTER XXX </p><p>THE COMING OF LAW AND ORDER </p><p>IT TOOK them a few seconds to realize </p><p>what had happened. Was it possible? </p><p>Had these town crooks really had the nerve </p><p>to play such a trick on Crew One? For a </p><p>moment they gaped; then they swore soft- </p><p>ly and swarmed toward the ring. A num- </p><p>ber of the gangsters made the mistake of </p><p>trying to halt them and hold them back. </p><p> “Hoop-la!” cried the woodsmen, and the</p><p>room full of men exploded in battle royal. </p><p> The small ring became a place where a</p><p>dozen men were struggling instead of two. </p><p>Down on the floor twoscore men met fist to </p><p>fist. The outsiders were in the majority, </p><p>and they were out to avenge the unfair tac- </p><p>tics by which their men had been beaten, </p><p>the taunts hurled at them, and the tempo- </p><p>rary loss of their money—temporary, be- </p><p>cause four of them stripped the gambler </p><p>down to the last yellow diamond on his </p><p>fingers. </p><p> In the ring Gaston fought furiously</p><p>against odds until the rush of his friends </p><p>carried his foes underfoot. He was marked, </p><p>but he soon was satisfied with his share of </p><p>the struggle, and he managed to free him- </p><p>self for a moment from the press. </p><p> The outsiders by this time had the whip-</p><p>hand and the fight had become knock-down- </p><p>and-drag-out. Taggart’s gangsters were be- </p><p>ing hurled through doors and windows. </p><p>Later they would return with reinforce- </p><p>ments and the battle would be renewed, but </p><p>for the time being the fight was all to Crew </p><p>One. </p><p> It was no part of Gaston’s program to</p><p>take part in a general rough-house. He re- </p><p>alized how greatly fortune had favored him </p><p>in his desperate venture, and returning </p><p>calmness dictated that he escape. In a jam </p><p>near the door he caught sight of the flaming </p><p>upper garment of Red-Shirt Murphy. </p><p> Murphy was cornered by two young lum-</p><p>ber-jacks who were polishing him off to the </p><p>queen’s taste. A smile flitted over Gaston’s </p><p>face, and he dropped into the melee on the </p><p>floor. It was the work of a few seconds to </p><p>work his way through to the door. </p><p> “Let him go, boys,” he commanded,</p><p>clutching Murphy’s arm. “He’s my meat.” </p><p>“All right, champeen,” they said, and </p><p>turned to hunt a fresh victim. </p><p> “Leggo me!” growled Murphy. “Hey,</p><p>Taggart’s men, here’s Thorson. Knife him, </p><p>somebody, knife the-!” </p><p> Gaston twisted his arm behind him and</p><p>thrust him outside. Two of Murphy’s </p><p>friends came running toward him. </p><p> “Out of the way,” said Gaston. “I’m</p><p>arresting Murphy for robbing that kid this </p><p>evening. I’m marshal of this town. Pretty </p><p>soon I’ll come back and get some more of </p><p>you. Out of the way. Hike!” </p><p> At a dog-trot he propelled Murphy ahead</p><p>of him out of the crowd and up the street, </p><p>before any one dared to make a move. The </p><p>amazed gangsters stood dumfounded while </p><p>Gaston ran his prisoner across the open </p><p>space separating the two parts of town. </p><p>He was in front of Hale’s store before they </p><p>moved. Then they shouted: </p><p> “Hi! Thorson’s gobbled Red Shirt and’s</p><p>carrying him off. Come here to me. We </p><p>got to get Red Shirt away.” </p><p> Gaston threw his prisoner into Hale’s</p><p>store. Hale, Tom Pine, Dr. Sanders, Loner- </p><p>gan and six of his men, old Perkins, the </p><p>postmaster and a few others, were assem- </p><p>bled there. </p><p> “Here’s the first prisoner of the first mar-</p><p>shal of Havens Falls,” announced Gaston. </p><p>“Law and order has come, gentlemen. </p><p>Guard him carefully. I’ll be back in a min- </p><p>ute.” </p><p> He snatched his rifle from Tom Pine’s</p><p>hand and was outside and half-way back </p><p>toward the red lights by the time Murphy’s </p><p>friends had gathered courage to follow. </p><p>There were probably a dozen of them, and </p><p>they came cursing up the street,demanding </p><p>Gaston Olaf </p><p>157 </p><p>Gaston’s life, and the freedom of Murphy. </p><p> Where the light from a window streaked</p><p>across the street Gaston drew a line in the </p><p>sand with the toe of his shoe, and slung his </p><p>rifle into the hollow of his arm. </p><p> “Here’s where you fellows stop—right at</p><p>this line,” he said quietly. “First one across </p><p>it gets what’s in the old gun. Who wants </p><p>it first?” </p><p> The gang stopped short. In the yellow</p><p>flare of light Gaston was not a pleasant ob- </p><p>ject to face. There was blood on his face </p><p>from the fight; his shirt was torn in several </p><p>places; his thick crop of hair was disordered </p><p>till each hair seemed to be standing on end. </p><p>And in the half-light his blue eyes gleamed </p><p>wickedly. </p><p> He was very serious. There was no joy</p><p>of battle about this. This was business, </p><p>duty. It was something that had to be </p><p>done, and he happened to be the man on </p><p>whom the job of doing it had fallen. </p><p> “There’s the line,” he said. “That’s the</p><p>line that marks the coming of law and order </p><p>to Havens Falls. You fellows have done </p><p>just as you please up to now. You can’t </p><p>do that any more. Things have changed. </p><p>I’ve been made marshal of this town. I’m </p><p>here to tell you fellows your day of being </p><p>top - loaders here is over. Understand? </p><p>From now on I’ll tell you what you can do </p><p>and what you can’t do in this town. And </p><p>first of all you can’t come up into this part </p><p>of town. You can’t cross that line. Do </p><p>you understand?” </p><p> Gaston sensed that people were moving</p><p>toward him from behind. He looked and </p><p>saw that in the darkness at his back a crowd </p><p>had gathered to his support. Nearest him </p><p>were Tom Pine, Lonergan and Hale. Each </p><p>of them was armed with a shotgun. </p><p> Dr. Sanders, Perkins, Lonergan’s men</p><p>and others were there, too, bringing the to- </p><p>tal number up to ten, all armed. They </p><p>came silently, stretching across the street </p><p>in a ragged line. It was a new business to </p><p>most of them; their faces were white and </p><p>they were breathing hard. But within them</p><p>was the spirit of the town-makers, the men </p><p>of homes, who bring order into the wilder- </p><p>ness. </p><p> This was something that had to be done</p><p>for the good of the town. Before them were </p><p>the forces of lawlessness and disorder, from </p><p>which they and theirs had suffered helpless- </p><p>ly for so long. Behind them were their </p><p>homes, their women, their children—all that </p><p>was sacred in the world to them. And the </p><p>time had come for them to stand out be- </p><p>tween these and the forces of evil. </p><p> They didn’t like to do it; fighting wasn’t</p><p>in their line. But it had to be done. So </p><p>they were doing it. And Taggart’s gang- </p><p>sters looked at the silent line of white faces, </p><p>and the formidable figure that led them, </p><p>and grew weak. As always, the bravado </p><p>courage of the bad man was as the reckless- </p><p>ness of a boy in the face of the calm deter- </p><p>mination of law-abiding citizens defending </p><p>their homes. </p><p> The two sides faced each other in silence;</p><p>then Gaston’s voice: </p><p> “Now toddle back to your boss. Tell</p><p>him what’s happened. Tell him this rule </p><p>has come to stay. You fellows can’t come </p><p>up into this part of town any more. Then </p><p>round up all of your gang and see if you </p><p>can scare up nerve enough to come back </p><p>and cross that line.” </p><p> Then the tension broke. The gangsters</p><p>began to slink back one by one. They went </p><p>with curses on their lips. A dozen yards </p><p>away they stopped and put their heads to- </p><p>gether. </p><p> “We’ll come back, all right,” growled one</p><p>of them, as they continued their 'retreat. </p><p>“And when we come, you fellows’ll be glad </p><p>to get out of town alive.” </p><p>CHAPTER XXXI </p><p>TAGGART’S DEFIANCE </p><p>GASTON turned about and faced the </p><p>posse which had assembled to his sup- </p><p>port. He did not laugh at the threat which </p><p>had been hurled at them. The mood of </p><p>recklessness had passed; he was as coldly </p><p>serious and determined as the most sober</p><p>citizen present. </p><p> “Well, we’ve served notice on them now,”</p><p>he said quietly. </p><p> His eyes ran swiftly up and down the line</p><p>and suddenly he was filled with a great </p><p>pride at the thought of being chosen leader </p><p>by such men. With the exception of Tom </p><p>Pine and a couple of reckless youngsters in </p><p>Lonergan’s crew, the business in hand was </p><p>appalling to his followers. They were not </p><p>men of violence; they were men with a hun- </p><p>ger for orderly communities. Some of them </p><p>actually were sick at stomach from the un- </p><p>accustomed sensations of the situation. Yet </p><p>not one of them but plainly told by the </p><p>158 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>look on his face that he was ready to stand </p><p>up and give life itself if necessary in order </p><p>that the new rule of law and &lt;?rder might </p><p>be established. </p><p> To Gaston, who always deprecated his</p><p>own courage because the prospect of trouble </p><p>only filled him with joy, there was some- </p><p>thing heroic in the courage of these quiet </p><p>citizens. He saw them in a new light—es- </p><p>pecially Hale. Hale was handling his shot- </p><p>gun clumsily, but his eyes were as steady as </p><p>Gaston’s or Tom Pine’s. </p><p> “Yes,” said Lonergan, “we’ve served ’em</p><p>notice. Now they’ve either got to pull their </p><p>steel or back down.” </p><p> “They*-won’t back down,” said Hale.</p><p>“Taggart won’t let ’em.” </p><p> “Nope.” Old Perkins was nervously</p><p>chewing tobacco. “Nope, they won’t back </p><p>down.” </p><p> “Neither will we,” said another man.</p><p> “No,” they said, almost as one.</p><p> “What did you do with Murphy?” asked</p><p>Gaston. </p><p> “Put him in a shack back of the post-</p><p>office with two men to guard him.” </p><p> They stood looking down toward the red</p><p>lights. It was quiet down there, but Gas- </p><p>ton knew what trouble was boiling, and </p><p>doubts assailed him as he considered the </p><p>possible results to these men. </p><p> “Have I done right, boys?” he asked.</p><p> “You’ve done right.”</p><p> “I’ve brought trouble coming to you.”</p><p>“It had to come sometime. Better now </p><p>than later.” </p><p> “All right. They won’t be back here for</p><p>a little time at least. Let’s go to Hale’s </p><p>store and decide what to do.” </p><p> In the light of the store-lamps they saw</p><p>the blood on his face. </p><p> “Hey!” cried Dr. Sanders. “I knew</p><p>there’d be work for me tonight, but I didn’t </p><p>think it would start so soon. How’d you </p><p>get that? Come here while I fix you up. </p><p>Who gave it to you?” </p><p> Gaston opened his mouth to tell of the</p><p>fight in the saloon, but stopped. Looking </p><p>back upon it he saw suddenly how desperate </p><p>and reckless had been his adventure. In the </p><p>same instant he remembered how, but a </p><p>short time ago, he had promised to be care- </p><p>ful this night. He felt ashamed. </p><p>“Murphy’s friends,” he replied evasively, </p><p>bending over the basin which the doctor had </p><p>brought. “It doesn’t amount to anything.” </p><p>“Amounts to this,” snapped Tom Pine, </p><p>“you sneaked off and hogged the fun after </p><p>promising to let me in on it.” </p><p> “Don’t worry; there’ll be plenty more fun</p><p>before this night’s over. Now, let’s put our </p><p>heads together. I’ve arrested Murphy. </p><p>He’s our first prisoner. Those fellows will </p><p>be after him, sure as we’re living. </p><p> “Murphy’s nothing but a big bum, and</p><p>the best thing to do with him is to kick him </p><p>out of town; but for the present he’s impor- </p><p>tant. We’ve got to keep him as a warning </p><p>to ’em. So I guess there won’t be much </p><p>sleep for any of us tonight. Those fellows </p><p>will try to nose around and find out where </p><p>we’ve got him. We’ve got to meet them </p><p>at that line out there and persuade ’em to </p><p>keep on their own side of the fence.” </p><p>“Right. You’re the boss; give your or- </p><p>ders.” </p><p> “Well, I think this store is a good place</p><p>for us to make camp in,” said Gaston. </p><p>“How many more men can we get together </p><p>that we can depend upon?” </p><p> A silence fell over the room. Hale broke</p><p>it. </p><p> “Counting the two men guarding Mur-</p><p>phy, we’re most of us here. There’s three </p><p>or four men more will be here later. Then </p><p>there are some away who won’t be back to- </p><p>night. Count on an even dozen.” </p><p>“A dozen?” repeated Gaston cheerfully. </p><p>“Well, we’ll have to make that do, then. </p><p>We’ll-” </p><p> “You’ll raise-, you will!”</p><p> A voice in the doorway brought the last</p><p>man of them to his feet. </p><p> “You’ll raise-and put a foundation</p><p>under it, you will!” </p><p> Taggart was standing there, his bulk fill-</p><p>ing the doorway. He was all alone. He </p><p>was stiff-eyed from whisky; his fang-like </p><p>teeth showed through his ragged beard in a </p><p>leering grin; and he stood leaning forward, </p><p>his huge hands curved before him like claws. </p><p> The sudden sight of him sent a chill down</p><p>the back of most of those present. They re- </p><p>alized fully now what they had to combat. </p><p> “Hello, Taggart,” said Gaston easily.</p><p>“Where’s your shotgun?” </p><p> Taggart’s head dropped further forward,</p><p>his grin grew wider, and if ever eyes flashed </p><p>fire his blood-shot optics did then. </p><p> “Thorson, if I was bothering about you</p><p>any more I’d have brought a shotgun,” he </p><p>said thickly. “But you’re—you’re only one </p><p>dog in a flock now, one cur in a crowd! And </p><p>I’ve decided to whip the whole lot of you </p><p>Gaston Olaf </p><p>159 </p><p>out of my country. Do you hear?” His </p><p>voice suddenly rose to a demoniacal shout </p><p>that shook the lamps under the ceiling. </p><p>“The whole lot of you, curs—dogs, bitches, </p><p>pups! Yes, and your kennels, too. You’re </p><p>all going together. Back up Thorson, will </p><p>you? Follow him because he’s dared to </p><p>buck me, eh? Ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha! Buck </p><p>me!” </p><p> He paused.</p><p> “Buck me!” he repeated in a whisper, his</p><p>face swelling horribly. Suddenly he swept </p><p>his arm before him as if brushing something </p><p>out of his way, and stepped back a step. </p><p>“All of you — whipped dogs — get away. </p><p>Take your women and kids and travel. For </p><p>there’ll be no kennels for you to bed down </p><p>in when daylight comes in the morning!” </p><p>He was gone, lurching back out of sight </p><p>in the darkness as suddenly as he had come. </p><p> The men in the store looked at one an-</p><p>other. Old Perkins’s shrill treble rose: </p><p> “Well, the dirty-1”</p><p> Then they all looked at Gaston. The</p><p>doctor had halted in the act of putting stick- </p><p>ing-plaster on a cut on his cheek, and Gas- </p><p>ton was calmly completing the operation. </p><p> “Well—darn it, Doc, this stuff won’t</p><p>stick. Well, boys, now Devil Dave has </p><p>served notice on us.” </p><p> There was no reply; they were watching</p><p>him. By his calmness they sensed that he </p><p>was confident that the solution of their </p><p>problem lay with him. </p><p> “Wha—what did he mean?” gasped a</p><p>white-faced man. </p><p> “Mean?” said Gaston. “Huh! That’s</p><p>easy; he means that he’s going to burn us </p><p>out.” </p><p>CHAPTER XXXII </p><p>THE POWER OF WOMAN </p><p> A MOMENT of horror-stricken silence</p><p> followed Gaston’s words.</p><p> “Well, the dirty-!” repeated old Per-</p><p>kins. </p><p> “Burn us out? Good God! He wouldn’t</p><p>dare do that!” </p><p> “You saw him, didn’t you?” said Gaston.</p><p>“Did he look like a man who’d stop at any- </p><p>thing?” </p><p> Lonergan shook his head.</p><p> “He’ll do it—if he can. He’s done things</p><p>like it before.” </p><p> Tom Pine cleared his throat noisily.</p><p> “I could have shot him right where he</p><p>stood,” he said, puzzled. “I had my gun </p><p>right here. And I was thinking: ‘You </p><p>crooked old whelp, I’ll do one good thing </p><p>in this world and rid it of you.’ But I </p><p>couldn’t do it. Darn your law and order! </p><p>it’s making me soft, too.” </p><p> “Well?” demanded Perkins. “What are</p><p>we going to do now?” </p><p> “Keep him from doing it.”</p><p> Gaston looked his men over. There</p><p>would be twelve of them, all told. Taggart </p><p>would have ftfty. Gaston moved swiftly </p><p>toward the door. </p><p> “Boys, there aren’t enough of us,” he said</p><p>sharply. “We couldn’t possibly keep ’em </p><p>from getting fires started. Everything is </p><p>dry as kindling. If a fire once gets hold here </p><p>now, everything goes. So we’ve got to keep </p><p>’em from getting started. To do that we’ve </p><p>got to have more men. And—you fellows </p><p>stay right here. I’m going out and try to </p><p>get ’em.” </p><p> Tom Pine made to rise, but Gaston was</p><p>away on the run. He knew that he must </p><p>act and get results swiftly if at all. And as </p><p>he ran by a roundabout way for Sam’s </p><p>Place he shook his head at the queer turn of </p><p>events. For if he was to save Havens Falls </p><p>he must do it because of his carelessness. </p><p> Gaston knew lumberjacks. He knew</p><p>that the men whose champion he had been </p><p>and for whom he had exposed the methods </p><p>of the crooked pugilist, were, for the evening</p><p>at least, his sworn friends. They would have </p><p>liked nothing better than to hoist him on </p><p>their shoulders, parade the town with him, </p><p>fill him up on all the liquors that the place </p><p>afforded. Could he halt them in their wild </p><p>career of the evening and turn their hero- </p><p>worship to serious ends? </p><p> He approached Sam’s Place cautiously,</p><p>keeping in the dark. Inside the outsiders </p><p>were holding sway. The saloon - keeper, </p><p>eager for their patronage now that they had </p><p>their money back, had helped them kick </p><p>fighter, gambler and knockout-men into the </p><p>street, and the place was in their hands. </p><p> Gaston waited until one of the older men</p><p>who first had spoken to him, came out for </p><p>a moment’s air. Him he caught by the arm </p><p>and drew to one side out of the light. </p><p> “My name’s McKenzie, boy,” insisted</p><p>the man, “and I’m going to buy you a drink </p><p>or-” </p><p> “All right, McKenzie—but not just now.</p><p>I need friends.” </p><p>i6o </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Put ’er there!” cried McKenzie, shaking</p><p>hands. “Now, lead the way.” </p><p> “I need a lot of friends. This is serious,</p><p>McKenzie. It’s life or death for me—and </p><p>possibly some men and women and chil- </p><p>dren.” </p><p> McKenzie sobered immediately.</p><p> “There’s forty men in our crew,” he said.</p><p>“After that fight we’re with you to a man.” </p><p>“Well, for God’s sake, McKenzie, round </p><p>’em up! Tell ’em it’s against that gang. If </p><p>they’re white men tell ’em this is the time </p><p>to show it. Pass the word on the quiet, </p><p>and get ’em up to the big store—Hale’s store </p><p>—as soon as you can. And you can prom- </p><p>ise them a fight that will make anything </p><p>they’ve ever been in look foolish. Do this </p><p>now, if you want to square up for that </p><p>fight.” </p><p> “ ’Nough said. I was their foreman all</p><p>Winter. I’ll have ’em there in a hurry, or </p><p>I’m a Swede.” </p><p> Gaston hurried back to the store. Three</p><p>more scared-looking but determined men </p><p>had joined the crowd, so there now were </p><p>fifteen decent citizens to oppose Taggart’s </p><p>gang. Gaston looked them over and sucked </p><p>in his lips. He had just seen the river-front </p><p>swarming with the gangsters. Fifty of them </p><p>there would be, and they were a tough, hard- </p><p>bitten crew. Futile to oppose them with </p><p>these soft-muscled townsmen. If McKen- </p><p>zie’s men failed him- </p><p> “They’re coming!” came the shout from</p><p>outside. </p><p> “Hoop-la!”</p><p> The first of McKenzie’s crew came tum-</p><p>bling into the room, half a dozen of them, </p><p>with big Erik in the lead. They swarmed </p><p>around Gaston Olaf, thrusting the others </p><p>aside. One man held toward him a roll of </p><p>bills; two held forth bottles. </p><p> “There’s your share of the winnings, ol’</p><p>bear. We chipped in. Take it. We won </p><p>on you. Take a drink, too.” ' </p><p> Gaston drank sparingly from each bottle</p><p>and accepted the bills. They would have </p><p>taken it as an insult had he refused. </p><p> “Now that’s all the booze we’ll touch for</p><p>the present, boys,” said he. “And this roll </p><p>will pay for a little celebration afterward.” </p><p>Chaffing them, shaking the hands that </p><p>were outstretched to him, laughing heartily </p><p>as they smote him affectionately on the </p><p>back and called him endearing and profane </p><p>names, he received them as they came tum- </p><p>bling into the store. They were eager to </p><p>come, eager to shake his hand. The man </p><p>who had stolen the Taggart drive, and on </p><p>top of that given them sweet revenge on </p><p>the slugger, was for this night their hero, </p><p>their great man of the world. On the other </p><p>hand, they were in town to celebrate, and </p><p>this store and this crowd looked like a </p><p>mighty dry place. </p><p> “Where’s the excitement, Thorson?” they</p><p>cried. “Stir ’er up! This looks too much </p><p>like church for us.” </p><p> When McKenzie came hurrying in at the</p><p>head of a dozen men, bringing the number </p><p>of this crew present up to thirty, Gaston </p><p>held up his hand for silence. </p><p> “Boys,” he began seriously, “we want</p><p>you to join us. We need your help!” </p><p>“Who’s ‘we’? ” demanded a voice. </p><p> “Don’t make no difference who ’tis,”</p><p>snapped McKenzie. “There’s a man we </p><p>owe our shirts to. You listen to him.” </p><p>“The gang that’s been bucking you fel- </p><p>lows all evening is fixing to burn this end </p><p>of town,” continued Gaston. He talked </p><p>swiftly, for he saw that this sober sort of </p><p>meeting was not to the taste of the joyous </p><p>lumberjacks, and he feared he might lose </p><p>his hold. “That gang is Taggart’s. You </p><p>know how they’ve run things around here. </p><p>This end of town is where the white people </p><p>live in this settlement. There are women </p><p>and babies in these houses, boys; and that </p><p>gang is fixing to burn ’em out. If we’re </p><p>white men we can’t stand by and see that </p><p>done. We need you boys with us; we aren’t </p><p>enough to protect those women and kids </p><p>without you. What do you say? Are you </p><p>white men? Will you stick with us and </p><p>keep that gang from getting up into this </p><p>end of town?”</p><p> By the silence that followed his speech</p><p>Gaston knew the men were not won. Like </p><p>wild, unbroken colts the lumberjacks were </p><p>balking. Had he gaily placed himself at </p><p>their head and led them to clean out a saloon, </p><p>they would have followed without a mo- </p><p>ment’s hesitation. But they balked at this </p><p>sober appeal for help to guard the houses of </p><p>towns people against fire. </p><p> “Where the - is the fun in that?”</p><p>growled one. “Come on; let’s go back and </p><p>get a drink.” </p><p> “Go ahead!” cried Gaston, flaring an-</p><p>grily. “Go get your drink; you probably </p><p>wouldn’t be any good anyhow.” </p><p> “Don’t tear your shirt, Noisy,” spoke</p><p>McKenzie, his hand on the man’s shoulder. </p><p>Gaston Olaf </p><p>161 </p><p>“Stay right here. But lemme tell you, </p><p>Thorson, this isn’t exactly what we were </p><p>looking for.” </p><p> “Afraid?”</p><p> “Come off, man; don’t get on your horse</p><p>just because we don’t fall over ourselves to </p><p>go with you. There’s some of us with wo- </p><p>men and kids, too; and we get a living for </p><p>them on Taggart’s pay-roll. There’d be no </p><p>more work in this country for a man who </p><p>bucked Taggart’s gang too hard.” </p><p> At this Lonergan thrust his square figure</p><p>beside Gaston. </p><p> “Well, well, if it ain’t Old Iron Trail!”</p><p>greeted an old jack. “Speak up, Lonergan; </p><p>talk’s cheap.” </p><p> “Not the kind of talk I’m going to make,”</p><p>retorted Lonergan. “You know who I am, </p><p>don’t you, boys?” </p><p> “Sure. He’s the man who grows rail-</p><p>roads. Spit it out, old hoss.” </p><p> Lonergan turned toward McKenzie.</p><p> “You said there’d be no work in this coun-</p><p>try for a man who bucked Taggart too hard. </p><p>You’re wrong. That’s just the kind of man </p><p>who’ll be able to find work right here—as </p><p>much as he wants—at better wages than </p><p>Taggart pays. In fact, I’m up here to hire </p><p>men. Next week we’re going to start blaz- </p><p>ing the trail for the line from La Croix up </p><p>here. I’ll need axmen, shovelers, skinners, </p><p>drivers, spikers, cooks, water-boys, walking- </p><p>bosses—there’ll be two crews. The log- </p><p>ging’s over for this season. How about a </p><p>steady job for all Spring and Summer? And </p><p>the boys who get on my pay-roll will be the </p><p>ones who help us tonight.” </p><p> “That goes!” cried McKenzie. “I play</p><p>with you.” </p><p> Together with a few of the older men he</p><p>pressed forward toward Lonergan. But the </p><p>young fellows, the bulk of the crew, stood </p><p>still. The idea of providing themselves with </p><p>further employment was farthest of all from </p><p>their minds just then. The future might</p><p>take care of itself; in the meantime, furious, </p><p>thoughtless excitement was what they </p><p>craved. This thing was too orderly, too </p><p>sober for them. </p><p> “To-with a job!” laughed one. “Our</p><p>money’s still good.” </p><p> “But don’t forget who saved it for you,”</p><p>shouted McKenzie. </p><p> “To-! We ain’t playing police for no</p><p>man’s town. Come on, boys; this ain’t no </p><p>fun.” </p><p> “Then go!” Gaston’s voice vibrated with</p><p> 11</p><p>anger, though from the first he had feared </p><p>just such a turn. “And when we’ve won </p><p>this fight alone we’ll make you fellows take </p><p>the tall timber on the run.” </p><p> They laughed and started for the door;</p><p>wild colts that would not be haltered. And </p><p>then they stopped. </p><p> “Has anything happened; is any one</p><p>hurt?” </p><p> Gaston and Hale started as one and look-</p><p>ed at each other at the sound of the new </p><p>voice. It was Rose. She came running in; </p><p>and the men made way for her. Inside the </p><p>door she paused, panting, her hands on her </p><p>breast, and looked around. </p><p> “Oh!” Her eyes fell on Gaston, and de-</p><p>spite the plaster on his face, she gave an </p><p>exclamation of relief. Then on Hale, and </p><p>she grew quiet. “I saw the crowd; I was </p><p>afraid some one had been hurt. But—I’m </p><p>mistaken?” </p><p> “Nobody hurt, Miss Rose.” Dr. Sanders</p><p>tried to say it jauntily, but it was a miserable </p><p>failure. </p><p> Hale looked steadily at the floor; Gaston</p><p>looked over her head. Neither cared to </p><p>meet her inquiring eyes. Nor did Lonergan, </p><p>or Tom, or the doctor. But the lumber- </p><p>jacks of Crew One were staring at her as at </p><p>a vision, and the light of wickedness went </p><p>out of many eyes and gave place to some-</p><p>thing better. They looked at her worship- </p><p>fully. </p><p> She was dressed in a gown of soft white-</p><p>ness, and her face was alight with the light </p><p>of a mother-heart, stirred with alarm. To </p><p>those rough boy-men she was more than </p><p>merely a dainty and beautiful girl. She </p><p>was the eternal dream woman which men </p><p>of their ilk dream of and are prepared to </p><p>worship. </p><p> Their caps came off unconsciously. They</p><p>grew sober. </p><p> Rose looked at the serious faces of the</p><p>townsmen and tried in vain to catch Gas- </p><p>ton’s eye. </p><p> “Nobody hurt at all,” said he airily.</p><p>“Just a little meeting.” </p><p> “What is it?” she whispered. “Is any-</p><p>thing going—to—happen?” </p><p> “No, no!” he said.</p><p> “Dick!” she cried to Hale.</p><p> “No, no. Everything’s all right. You—•</p><p>you had better go home.” </p><p>i She looked around. She couldn’t under- </p><p>stand. There was something behind the </p><p>faces which she had learned to know so </p><p>162 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>well. She looked at Lonergan, at Tom Pine, </p><p>at Dr. Sanders. She turned and looked at </p><p>the men of Crew One. </p><p> “Boys!” she cried to them. “You’ll tell</p><p>me, I know—is anything going to happen?” </p><p> There was a moment of silence. Crew</p><p>One began to smile. Then came the reply, </p><p>bellowed earnestly from a huge pair of lungs </p><p>—from the man who had said, “This ain’t </p><p>no fun”: </p><p> “Not by a da—! Excuse me, lady. I</p><p>mean, no, sir! No siree, ma’am; there ain’t </p><p>nothing going to happen. No, by Godfrey! </p><p>Not enough—not enough to fry a six-inch </p><p>trout at!” </p><p> And Crew One shouted as one man to</p><p>back him up. </p><p> “That’s right; you bet your bottom</p><p>boots!” </p><p>CHAPTER XXXIII </p><p>BATTLE </p><p>GASTON, watching the faces of the men, </p><p>whispered sharply to Hale: </p><p> “Take her home. Get her away from</p><p>here.” </p><p> He would have given much to accompany</p><p>her home himself, but his place just then </p><p>was with Crew One. </p><p> Rose’s eyes grew soft at the sudden heart-</p><p>felt tribute which had been given her. She </p><p>held forth her hands to them in a gesture of </p><p>fraternity. </p><p> “Thank you, boys, thank you!” she mur-</p><p>mured. “Yes, Dick; I know. I’ll go home.” </p><p> They watched her go out, watched her,</p><p>cap in hand, watched till the last glimpse of </p><p>her was lost in the darkness. </p><p> “Well,” said Gaston, “you discovered</p><p>you were white men, after all, did you?” </p><p> They came swarming back to him. They</p><p>were eager to make amends, eager to do </p><p>something ferocious to prove that they </p><p>meant what they had said. </p><p> “Say, Husk, we didn’t understand,” they</p><p>shouted. They held forth their hands. </p><p>“How the-could we understand? You </p><p>know what kind of women we’d been seeing </p><p>in this burg. By Godfrey! That’s a thor- </p><p>oughbred little lady. Come on, Big Fellow, </p><p>shake hands. We’re all white men together </p><p>now. Now we know what you’re standing </p><p>up for, Thorson. Lead the way. We’ll go </p><p>to-for you now.” </p><p>“All right, boys. I knew you were white </p><p>men if it was put up to you right.” Gaston </p><p>leaned over to Lonergan. “Lonergan, take </p><p>all your men who’ve got guns and scatter </p><p>them in a straight line across the town right </p><p>here. You’ve enough that nobody can slip </p><p>through without being seen. If any Tag- </p><p>gart man gets through, lire a shot. They </p><p>may go into the timber and try to sneak in </p><p>and fire her from behind. When Hale comes </p><p>back better have him and a couple others </p><p>keep moving through this end of town on </p><p>the lookout. Better go at once.” </p><p> “Right. Come on, boys.”</p><p> Lonergan led the posse of citizens out</p><p>into the night. Tom Pine remained behind. </p><p> “All right, Tom,” said Gaston. “Put</p><p>your rifle down. You can go with us. Now, </p><p>boys, a couple of you slip down and see if </p><p>the gang is bunched up any place.” </p><p> Two youngsters ran out eagerly. They</p><p>were back in ten minutes, their number in- </p><p>creased to a dozen by members of Crew </p><p>One whom they had picked up. </p><p> “They’re just leaving McCarthy’s place,”</p><p>was the report. “They’re coming this way.” </p><p>“Fine!” cried Gaston. “Boys, I prom- </p><p>ised you a fight. Roll up your sleeves and </p><p>spit on your hands. We’ve got to clean up </p><p>that gang tonight, and the way to lick a </p><p>man is to get right at him.” </p><p> In two great leaps he was at the door.</p><p> “Can we handle ’em?” he cried.</p><p> “Let us at ’em!”</p><p> “Then come a-running!” yelled Gaston,</p><p>and on the dead run he led his men out of </p><p>the store, and straight at the black mass </p><p>which was coming up the street. </p><p> Taggart’s gang stopped suddenly at the</p><p>line which Gaston had drawn across the </p><p>street. They stopped in surprise. </p><p> They had come on Taggart’s orders, ex-</p><p>pecting to find a dozen townsmen in Hale’s </p><p>store. Half a dozen carried shotguns. </p><p>Their plan was to trap the men in the store, </p><p>hold them helpless at gun-muzzles and fire </p><p>the town at their leisure. They had even </p><p>come prepared to shoot and shoot quickly </p><p>at any movement of weapons on the part of </p><p>their opponents. </p><p> But what they found was considerably</p><p>different from what they had expected. </p><p> Down the street at them came hurtling a</p><p>crowd of yelling men as large as their own. </p><p>With Gaston at their head, with their big- </p><p>gest men at his sides, Crew One just then </p><p>was terrible to behold. </p><p> Gaston had thrown off all self-restraint.</p><p>Gaston Olaf </p><p>163 </p><p>For the time he had gone berserk, throw- </p><p>ing himself headlong at the enemy, think- </p><p>ing not and caring not that they might be </p><p>armed, eager only to come to grips, confi- </p><p>dent that nothing could stop his rush. </p><p> His fury had communicated itself to his</p><p>followers. Thoughts of danger, impulses of </p><p>fear were for the time being non-existent </p><p>for them. Shotguns, eh? All right; a few </p><p>of them might go down; but they would </p><p>follow the big fellow through that crowd </p><p>and back again, trampling the guts out of </p><p>’em, if they never did anything else in the </p><p>world. </p><p> The gunmen hesitated. Their only chance</p><p>was to have shot instantly, without hesita- </p><p>tion, as at a leaping lynx. Ere they could </p><p>think they were lost. </p><p> Gaston knocked up the first gun and</p><p>struck the gang like a maddened bull, his </p><p>men at his side. In a flash the gunmen </p><p>were down, their weapons gone. </p><p> “Fight! -you, fight!”</p><p> Taggart’s voice rose from the rear, the</p><p>roar of a drunken animal. </p><p> “Fight!-you, fight!” echoed Gaston</p><p>mockingly. </p><p>THE gang stiffened at Taggart’s </p><p>command. The two sides met with </p><p>a thud. Groans followed; curses and </p><p>screams drowned the sound of blows. Over </p><p>it all rose Gaston’s laughter. </p><p> “Come on, boys — right through ’em!</p><p>We’ll get Devil Dave himself.” </p><p> A few knives flashed among the gang-</p><p>sters. The glint of steel drove the lumber- </p><p>jacks mad. They were not to be stopped. </p><p>For a minute, possibly, Taggart’s men held. </p><p>Then with a shout Gaston broke through </p><p>with a dozen men; and the fight was won. </p><p> “Clean ’em! Hold ’em, boys! Don’t let</p><p>’em run!” </p><p> Crew One was just beginning to fight.</p><p>Gaston and his dozen saw that Taggart had </p><p>disappeared, and threw themselves back on </p><p>the gang. </p><p> “That’s the stuff, boys. Don’t let ’em</p><p>run.” </p><p> But the gang, suddenly feeling itself sur-</p><p>rounded, broke away. They began to run </p><p>to both sides of the street. </p><p> “Don’t let ’em get away!” rose the cry.</p><p>“They used knives. Hold ’em back.” </p><p> The fight became a rout. The gangsters</p><p>ran in all directions. After them went the </p><p>lumber-jacks. </p><p> The battle spread to the timber on either</p><p>side of town. It raged steadily dow- to- </p><p>ward the red-lights. It swept into the sa- </p><p>loons and out again. Gaston led wherever </p><p>a group of the gangsters made a stand. In </p><p>his hand he carried as a bludgeon the bar- </p><p>rels of a shotgun—the stock he had smashed </p><p>on a gunman’s head—and at the sight of </p><p>him the gangsters turned and ran. </p><p> “Shoot him, shoot that-!” they cried.</p><p> But nobody found time to shoot. It was</p><p>a rush that would not be stayed. The den- </p><p>keepers hastily locked and barred their </p><p>doors and Taggart’s men found hiding- </p><p>places denied them. Down through the </p><p>river-front swept the pursuit. It ended at </p><p>the darkness along the river, and Gaston </p><p>and his men paused and drew breath. </p><p>There was no one left for them to fight. </p><p> “Hoop-la!” The lumberjacks danced</p><p>jigs and shouted. “Bring on your tigers; </p><p>we eat ’em alive.” </p><p> His face alight with triumph, Gaston</p><p>turned to look back. His jaw fell in horror. </p><p> “Good God, boys! Look! They’ve done</p><p>it after all.” </p><p> Up the street, in the upper part of town,</p><p>a sweep of flame was rushing toward the </p><p>sky. In the madness of the fight no man </p><p>of them had turned to note what was going </p><p>on behind them. Now the whole settle- </p><p>ment was lurid 'iinder the rapidly rising </p><p>wall of flame, and the roar and crackle of it </p><p>reached even down to the river.</p><p> “Good God! That must be Hale’s store.”</p><p>Gaston’s voice was a hoarse whisper. “And </p><p>if it is the whole street’ll go.” </p><p> He started back toward the flames on a</p><p>run, followed by his men. </p><p> It was not Hale’s store that was burning,</p><p>but the building next to it. This was used </p><p>as a livery-barn, and stood wall to wall with </p><p>Hale’s building. The bam already was a </p><p>furnace, too hot to approach. From its dry </p><p>shingle roof flakes of flame were flying </p><p>about. </p><p> Thus far Hale’s building, larger and high-</p><p>er than the barn, was serving as a bulwark, </p><p>shielding the rest of the settlement from the </p><p>flying embers. If the store went the way </p><p>of the barn, it would fire the rest of the </p><p>street. Olson’s Hotel, with tar paper on the </p><p>walls, stood directly across the street from </p><p>it; Dr. Sanders’s little office was at its side. </p><p> From these points the flames could reach</p><p>out and touch the other buildings, each of </p><p>which, built of pine and tinder-dry, was like </p><p>164 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>kindling awaiting the match. Nothing is </p><p>as helpless as a new woods-town when a fire </p><p>starts in dry weather. Usually there is but </p><p>one thing to do—move out and watch it burn. </p><p> Dr. Sanders was bending over a man of</p><p>Crew One who lay in the street when Gas- </p><p>ton arrived before the burning building. </p><p> “Well, Big Fellow, Taggart stole a march</p><p>when you were rushing his gang,” he greet- </p><p>ed. “He and Indian Charley sneaked </p><p>around back of the barn at the height of </p><p>the melee. Had a can of oil and threw it </p><p>on the hay. This boy, here, saw ’em and </p><p>jumped ’em just as Taggart struck a match. </p><p>They didn’t quite kill him, but the Indian </p><p>gave him a little steel between the ribs all </p><p>right. The barn was one flame in two min- </p><p>utes.” </p><p> Under Hale’s direction men were carry-</p><p>ing cases of dynamite from the store to a </p><p>safe place in the woods. Other men were </p><p>salvaging the stock while some were climb- </p><p>ing to the roof to beat out the flames as </p><p>they fell. The heat from the burning barn </p><p>prevented any attempt at working on it. </p><p> Hale came out and sized up the situation</p><p>carefully. </p><p>“We’ve got to start a water line,” shout- </p><p>ed Gaston. “If we get buckets enough we </p><p>can wet your building down and save it.” </p><p>Hale suddenly looked up at his roof. He </p><p>shook his head. </p><p> “Can’t do it,” he said. “Look.”</p><p> The roof and the side wall nearest the</p><p>barn had caught. The shingles were begin- </p><p>ning to burn, and dabs of flame began to </p><p>fall from them. </p><p> “Ladders! Get some ladders!” cried Gas-</p><p>ton. “It isn’t too late yet. “We’ve got </p><p>men enough here to save her.” </p><p> A burning shingle, spewed upward by the</p><p>force of the flames, floated through the </p><p>darkness above them and landed gracefully </p><p>on the stoop of Olson’s Hotel. </p><p> “You see? Too late,” said Hale. He</p><p>looked long at the big, stanch building in </p><p>which was a good share of all he possessed, </p><p>and onde more shook his head. “We </p><p>haven’t even got time to get the stock out. </p><p>Bill,” he called quietly to one of his men, </p><p>“go out and bring back one case of the dy- </p><p>namite, will you?” </p><p> “Man!” cried Gaston. “Don’t do that</p><p>yet. Let’s try first-” </p><p> A second flaming shingle sailed high over</p><p>the street, dropped, and was stamped out </p><p>beside the papered wall of the hotel. </p><p> “I wouldn’t have those poor women</p><p>burned out just to try to save my store, </p><p>Thorson. What do you think would hap- </p><p>pen if my roof began to flame?” </p><p> Gaston made no reply.</p><p> “It’s the only thing to do,” said Hale.</p><p> Gaston nodded his head silently. The</p><p>man had returned bearing a heavy box of </p><p>explosive. </p><p> “Clear out, boys,” cried Hale. “Get</p><p>away out of danger. “We’ve got to blow </p><p>her up.” </p><p> A groan and a sigh of relief came from</p><p>the crowd. They regretted the destruction </p><p>of the building and yet they realized that </p><p>by it the town would be saved. </p><p> “Fill up your buckets. Scatter your-</p><p>selves around ready to put out flying </p><p>brands. And get out of the way when the </p><p>shot comes.” </p><p> The crowd drew back until Hale, Gaston</p><p>and Tom Pine stood alone before the burn- </p><p>ing building. </p><p> “All right; no use delaying it,” said Hale,</p><p>and the three men moved to their work. </p><p> Gaston and Tom Pine salvaged stock af-</p><p>ter the charges had been laid and the fuses </p><p>lighted. At the last moment they rushed </p><p>out with armfuls of goods to join Hale, who </p><p>had sought shelter behind the hotel. </p><p> “There she goes!” groaned Tom Pine as</p><p>the building rose in the air at the explo-</p><p>sion. </p><p> Gaston vented a curse from the bottom</p><p>of his chest. The store had fallen together </p><p>like a house of cards. The barn fell with </p><p>it, and there remained of it only a low pile </p><p>of jumbled lumber, which burned without </p><p>offering any danger to the other buildings </p><p>of the town. </p><p> Hale wiped his lips with his fingers.</p><p> “Well,” he said steadily, "we did a good</p><p>job of that.” </p><p> A small form in white came running to-</p><p>ward them. It was Rose. </p><p> “Oh, Dick! Your store—how did it hap-</p><p>pen?” </p><p> “There was dynamite in it—it just blew</p><p>up,” replied Hale. </p><p> Her eyes fell on Gaston. Even in the</p><p>half-darkness he saw the light that leapt </p><p>into them, but he looked away, as if it was </p><p>something he had no right to see. </p><p> “Oh, Gaston! I’ve heard how you saved</p><p> “Don’t,” he cried hoarsely. “There’s the</p><p>man who did it—Hale. His store didn’t </p><p>Gaston Olaf </p><p>165 </p><p>just blow up. He blew it up himself, when </p><p>there might have been a chance to save it, </p><p>because he was too big a man to risk others’ </p><p>property to save his own.” </p><p> And he hurried back to where men with</p><p>buckets were splashing the fringes of the </p><p>dying fire. </p><p>CHAPTER XXXIV </p><p>GASTON BUYS STORE CLOTHES </p><p>OF ALL the wild nights that Havens </p><p>Falls had known, that was the wild- </p><p>est. For when Crew One calmed down suf- </p><p>ficiently to count noses, it found that three </p><p>more of its members had suflered knife- </p><p>wounds fully as serious as those of the man </p><p>who had tried to prevent Taggart from </p><p>firing the barn. </p><p> Only one result could follow this discov-</p><p>ery. The lumberjacks went on the war- </p><p>path for revenge. Nothing could stop </p><p>them. Gaston knew the breed too well to </p><p>try. Before the fire had burned down to </p><p>embers they were back on the river front, </p><p>red-eyed with hate and fury, roaring their </p><p>intentions to revenge the boys who had </p><p>been stabbed. </p><p> “Where’s Devil Dave? Where’s that-</p><p>Indian?” they demanded. “We’ll show ’em </p><p>it’s dangerous to knife boys from Camp </p><p>One.” </p><p> Naturally, neither Taggart nor the Indian</p><p>was to be found. The jacks began hunting </p><p>for other victims. These, likewise, were </p><p>hard to find. </p><p> Most of the gang had gone into hiding.</p><p>Such as had the hardihood to remain in the </p><p>saloons also had the cunning to conceal the </p><p>fact that they had taken any share in the </p><p>struggle. At rare intervals one of them was </p><p>recognized, then there was a beating and a </p><p>scurry, and only the strength of arm of the </p><p>cooler men prevented a lynching. </p><p> Soon the river-front was cleared of every</p><p>one who might be considered a fair object </p><p>for vengeance. The tension lessened. Men</p><p>began to laugh and slap one another on the </p><p>back. The fighting was over; now to cele- </p><p>brate it. Crew One rushed up to the bars </p><p>and set in to get truly good and drunk. </p><p> A few of the older men, McKenzie lead-</p><p>ing them, held back. They even sought to </p><p>urge moderation upon the others. As well </p><p>seek to whistle down a storm. McKenzie </p><p>and his kind, seeing the uselessness of re- </p><p>monstrance, went up to the hotel and went </p><p>to bed, while the victorious lumberjacks, </p><p>freed of all restraint, proceeded to make the </p><p>night terrible. They drank like madmen; </p><p>they howled like the bob-cats and wolves of </p><p>the forest, and they danced. </p><p> Gradually these effervescences ceased.</p><p>The dancing and shouting ceased; the affair </p><p>degenerated into a frightful drinking con- </p><p>test. They did not move from the bars. </p><p>Standing stiffly, leaning lazily, or hanging </p><p>on with both hands, they stayed by the </p><p>rude counters, drinking as often as a glass </p><p>was set before them. Presently the weaker </p><p>ones began to fall away; the floor became </p><p>littered with them; they lay outside sleep- </p><p>ing. The terrible liquor of the river-front </p><p>laid most of them low, but when daylight </p><p>appeared it found a few, stiff-eyed and </p><p>sleepy, hanging on to a bar with one hand </p><p>while with the other they carried liquor to </p><p>their already burnt-out throats. </p><p> In the upper part of town there was</p><p>peace and quiet, though few slept. Gaston </p><p>organized the men in watches, and himself </p><p>kept circling the town all night. With the </p><p>woods full of gangsters there was constant </p><p>danger that one of them would attempt to </p><p>sneak forth and start a new fire. It was </p><p>even possible that Taggart might round </p><p>them up and make another rush. </p><p> When daylight appeared it found Gaston</p><p>swinging briskly around on the patrol which </p><p>had occupied him throughout the night. A </p><p>feeling of bitterness and defeat came to him </p><p>as the rising sun revealed the smoking ruins </p><p>of Hale’s store and the barn. </p><p> The charred timbers seemed to grin at</p><p>him, reminding him that, in spite of the </p><p>overwhelming support of Crew One, Tag- </p><p>gart had managed to make good a small </p><p>part of his threat. </p><p> “I broke up the gang, but I didn’t get</p><p>the old man,” mused Gaston. “Devil Dave </p><p>is still fighting, and there’ll be more of this </p><p>to come.” </p><p> The store was a total loss. Of the large,</p><p>diversified stock which had filled it, a scant </p><p>tenth, possibly, had been saved. As Gas- </p><p>ton contemplated what was left, he forgot </p><p>Taggart and a thrill ran through him at the </p><p>memory of Hale’s splendid action in the </p><p>crisis. </p><p> “He’s a man,” he said aloud. “Yep; he’s</p><p>a real man.” </p><p> He laughed swiftly as he considered how</p><p>Taggart’s coup had failed, after all. </p><p>166 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Taggart set out to hurt Hale by burning</p><p>him out. He burned his store, all right, </p><p>but he didn’t hurt him. Not much! He </p><p>gave him a chance to show what was in </p><p>him. And he’s such a quiet, modest little </p><p>fellow you’d never suspect him of being </p><p>that big unless he had a chance like this. </p><p>Now he’s had his chance. Everybody </p><p>knows what he’s made of. People’ll be talk- </p><p>ing of this for years to come. They’ll look </p><p>up to Hale, and he deserves it. He’ll be </p><p>one of the biggest men around here, which </p><p>he is. Ha! And Taggart gave him his </p><p>chance. The laugh’s on Taggart, after all.” </p><p> Thus mused Gaston as, in the first rays</p><p>of the-rising sun, he marched up and down </p><p>the street. He had seen a fellow-man put to </p><p>the test and meet the test in glorious fash- </p><p>ion, and he was glowing with appreciation. </p><p> His own actions of the night he sincerely</p><p>considered as nothing in comparison. He </p><p>had merely led in a terrific fight, and he was </p><p>one of those who begin to hear sweet music </p><p>instead of the voice of fear at the approach </p><p>of trouble. He considered that he deserved </p><p>no credit. Had he been completely success- </p><p>ful against Taggart he might have been in- </p><p>clined to strut a little. But he had not </p><p>been that, quite. The blackened timbers </p><p>were reminders that Taggart was not de- </p><p>feated. </p><p> “And there’ll be no end of this trouble</p><p>till the old man himself is licked.” </p><p> His march had led him to beyond the</p><p>post-office at this moment. He stopped and </p><p>looked around. </p><p> The rays of the morning sun, topping the</p><p>eastern hills, was lighting up the front of </p><p>the Havens home, directly before him. </p><p>Gaston smiled. The house was very pretty </p><p>to his eyes in the morning light. Apparent- </p><p>ly its occupants were sleeping soundly. He </p><p>thought of Rose as he had left her with </p><p>Hale last night, and he was glad he had left </p><p>them and had told the truth about Hale’s </p><p>store. The better man must win. It must </p><p>be a fair game. If Hale was the man for </p><p>her, all right. </p><p> He recalled the look she had given him.</p><p>Her face, upturned to him, seemed to be </p><p>before him. He grew thoughtful. Could he </p><p>make her happy, a woman like her? Was </p><p>he the man for her? </p><p> He looked down at himself and felt abash-</p><p>ed. His shirt was torn into strips, and </p><p>through openings were to be seen cuts and </p><p>bruises. He looked at his hands; his knuck- </p><p>les were raw, and his right thumb was swol- </p><p>len and discolored. There was blood on his </p><p>red sash and buckskin trousers. No; he </p><p>was scarcely the sort of specimen to go </p><p>wooing a girl like Rose. </p><p> Gaston waited until smoke began to ap-</p><p>pear from chimneys and the town began </p><p>to stir. Then he went to the house of the </p><p>owner of the settlement’s clothing store and </p><p>dragged him forth. </p><p> “Hello!” cried the man. “Just in time</p><p>for breakfast.” </p><p> “Thanks. Don’t want any breakfast,”</p><p>retorted Gaston. “Come with me to your </p><p>store. I want a new outfit.” </p><p> “Something like what you’ve got on, I</p><p>s’pose?” said the merchant, when they </p><p>reached the store. </p><p> “No, siree, pop!” was the emphatic reply.</p><p>“Nothing at all like what I’ve got on. I </p><p>want—I want some regular store clothes.” </p><p>There was difficulty in fitting him. His </p><p>huge shoulders cracked wide open the first </p><p>coat he tried on. At last an outfit was as- </p><p>sembled. He also purchased a shaving </p><p>equipment and towels. </p><p> “Now you’ll come back and have break-</p><p>fast with us?” insisted the storekeeper. </p><p> Gaston excused himself. He had some-</p><p>thing else to do. </p><p> With his new clothing under his arm, he</p><p>slipped out of town and went down the </p><p>river till he found a deep, clear pool. The </p><p>sun was tinting the stream, and in the pool </p><p>the water was like a mirror. Kneeling on </p><p>the bank, Gaston leaned over and studied </p><p>his reflection in the water. He grinned at </p><p>what he saw. </p><p> “You certainly are hard - looking this</p><p>morning, boy,” he chuckled, “but so long as </p><p>you didn’t get your eyes blacked you can </p><p>fix yourself up.” </p><p> With the pool as his mirror he shaved</p><p>carefully. Next he stripped and stood poised </p><p>for an instant in the sunlight, a figure for a </p><p>sculptor to marvel at. </p><p> Into the ice-cold water he dove with</p><p>scarcely a splash, and when he came leap- </p><p>ing out to rub himself down he was rosy. </p><p>He dressed himself in new apparel from feet </p><p>to head and stretched himself gingerly, feel- </p><p>ing cramped and confined at every joint. </p><p> He was now arrayed in a sober suit of</p><p>blue, a soft, white shirt with a loose collar, </p><p>solid leather shoes, and a soft, black hat. </p><p>The coat pinched him under the arms and, </p><p>rubbers and moccasins being his accustomed </p><p>Gaston Olaf </p><p>167 </p><p>footwear, the shoes felt stiff and heavy on </p><p>his feet. </p><p> With a sigh he tossed his old, torn shirt</p><p>out into the current and watched it float </p><p>down-stream. The buckskin trousers, sash, </p><p>cap and rubber “high-tops” were about to </p><p>follow, but he checked himself. When he </p><p>presented himself at the room which he and </p><p>Tom had taken at the hotel, these articles </p><p>were under his arm. </p><p> Tom looked up at his entrance and laugh-</p><p>ed uproariously. </p><p> “What in Sam Hill, Gaston Olaf? You—</p><p>you got religion?” </p><p> “Oh, no,” said Gaston, tossing his old</p><p>clothes into a corner, “I just wanted to find </p><p>out how town clothes feel.” </p><p> “Well, how about it; how do they feeli'”</p><p> “Ohr” with a tug at his collar, “I sup-</p><p>pose a man can get used to anything.” </p><p>CHAPTER XXXV </p><p>A QUIET SUNDAY </p><p>A FTER the turbulent Saturday night, </p><p>Sunday came quiet and peaceful, the </p><p>calm succeeding the storm. It was the first </p><p>orderly Sunday in the history of Havens </p><p>Falls. True, a few of the celebrating lum- </p><p>berjacks upon awakening sought the bars </p><p>and attempted to resuscitate the corpse </p><p>of last night’s orgy, but the attempt fell </p><p>fiat. </p><p> Most of the men, in their own words, had</p><p>“got enough to last.” Some staggered up </p><p>to the hotel to sleep off the ravages of their </p><p>celebration; others sought shelter in the </p><p>woods for the same purpose. </p><p> A pall hung over the river-front. The</p><p>bars were nearly deserted. Where a group </p><p>was assembled there was no noise. Some- </p><p>thing new had come to the Settlement which </p><p>made itself felt even in the foulest corner of </p><p>the worst den in the front—law and order, </p><p>civilization. </p><p> In a vague, stupid sort of way the gang-</p><p>sters realized the coming of these new forces. </p><p>That crude line, drawn by Gaston’s foot </p><p>across the street, was like a wall unto them. </p><p>They scowled and cursed, but they made </p><p>no more ebullient statements that the town </p><p>was theirs, to do with as they pleased. </p><p>They had read the writing on the wall and </p><p>were troubled. </p><p> Taggart and Indian Charley had disap-</p><p>peared immediately after firing the barn. </p><p> “He looked like he needed a sleep,”</p><p>chuckled Tom Pine. “When he’s slept the </p><p>liquor out of his head he’ll probably come </p><p>back.” </p><p> “Yes,” said Gaston, “he’ll come back</p><p>sure.” </p><p> For the present, however, there was noth-</p><p>ing to cast a shadow over Havens Falls. </p><p>The day was a warm, sunny day in Spring; </p><p>the world was covered with new green </p><p>things; hundreds of birds sang in the trees; </p><p>and it was Sunday. </p><p> True, there were the ruins of Hale’s store</p><p>and the barn to remind of what had taken </p><p>place the night before. But Havens Falls </p><p>was young, and recovered rapidly, and by </p><p>noon those same ruins were things to joke </p><p>over while wondering if the trout wouldn’t </p><p>soon begin biting. There were picnic parties </p><p>up on the big hill, and rowing parties up </p><p>the river. </p><p> Dr. Sanders and Hulda paddled down-</p><p>stream in a birch-bark canoe. When they </p><p>returned, Hulda had promised that if he </p><p>would stop drinking so much whisky she </p><p>would marry him as soon as they could get </p><p>a house. It was Hale’s canoe that they </p><p>paddled in. Hale had no time to go canoe- </p><p>ing that Sunday. He and Lonergan were </p><p>busy hiring men and planning to build up </p><p>a new store. </p><p> In the middle of the bright afternoon</p><p>Gaston gave way to the desire that had </p><p>tugged at his heart all morning, and sought </p><p>out Rose. He found her starting up the hill </p><p>toward the picnic party, and she stood stock </p><p>still and marveled at the change in his at- </p><p>tire. </p><p> “Well,” he laughed, “do I look civilized?”</p><p> “Yes,” she said seriously, and paused.</p><p> “Even if I don’t act that way, yet?” he</p><p>suggested. </p><p> “No. I wasn’t going to say that,” was</p><p>her grave reply. “I have heard the men </p><p>talking about you. They say that the only </p><p>reason why you were able to save the town </p><p>was that—that you had acted so—so dar- </p><p>ingly-” </p><p> “Recklessly!” he interposed.</p><p> “Early in the evening. It isn’t for me to</p><p>judge you. Naturally I thought it was </p><p>strange for you to do such a thing imme- </p><p>diately after you had promised me that </p><p>you’d be careful. But men say it was fine </p><p>and big—your fighting; that you are a </p><p>great man. I suppose you are a judge of </p><p>what was necessary to save the town. You </p><p>168 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>did save us, anyhow, I know,” she concluded, </p><p>“and—and you do look civilized now.” </p><p> “I am glad of that,” he said gravely. “I</p><p>want to be civilized. I want to settle down. </p><p>But men are wrong when they say that </p><p>fighting was fine and big. It wasn’t. It </p><p>was fool recklessness. It turned out lucky, </p><p>though, for the town, and the people, and </p><p>everything about it, and I’m glad of that.” </p><p>They were half-way up the ridge now, </p><p>and they stopped and looked back. Below </p><p>them the town and its environs lay like a </p><p>green map. There lay the Settlement on its </p><p>flat in the river bend, a peerless town-site. </p><p>Through it curved the rushing La Croix, </p><p>lending virility and force to the scene. </p><p> On all hands stretched the fat farming</p><p>land, waiting only the plow of the breaker. </p><p>The birch gleamed white through the green </p><p>note of Spring. It was a good country; it </p><p>fairly smiled in the warm afternoon sunlight. </p><p> “Look at it!” cried Gaston, his out-door</p><p>senses thrilled by the scene. “Isn’t it </p><p>enough to make a man want to throw off </p><p>his coat and dig in to help make it fit for </p><p>folks to live in? Look at that flat along </p><p>the river—miles and miles of it! Think of </p><p>what a lot of young couples can find homes </p><p>and farms on that! Look at the power in </p><p>that river! Can’t you see mills and wood- </p><p>factories along it? </p><p> “And there’s the little town. When I</p><p>look at it, I don’t see those little shacks </p><p>down there; I see a street with brick build- </p><p>ings — stores, banks, everything; and </p><p>churches, and schools, and fine homes. </p><p>Down there’s where the depot will be, and </p><p>the trains’ll come swinging around that hog- </p><p>back yonder. And preachers, and school- </p><p>teachers, and all those kind of people will </p><p>come riding in on the train, and the folks </p><p>who marry will have a chance to educate </p><p>their kids right here. It’s a dream, I know, </p><p>but this dream certainly is coming true.” </p><p>She cried out, clapping her hands in de- </p><p>light at the picture he had drawn. </p><p> “Oh, Gaston! To think there’s all that</p><p>in you!” </p><p> He turned swiftly, a hungry look at the</p><p>corners of his mouth. </p><p> “Rose—Rose, there’s many sorts of things</p><p>in me. More than I know myself, perhaps. </p><p>Most of what’s come out so far has been </p><p>the rough, wild part-” </p><p> “No, sir! Don’t you say that. I owe</p><p>you too much to permit it. It’s been fine— </p><p>much of it.” </p><p> “Well, if there is anything fine in me, and</p><p>if it has shown, it’s been because of-” </p><p> He checked himself suddenly. He looked</p><p>away, out over the town. </p><p> “Rose,” he resumed quietly, “every man</p><p>—every white man—wants the fine in him </p><p>to come out, if it’s in him. I want it. I </p><p>don’t know whether it’s there or not. Some- </p><p>times I’m afraid it’s not. A man will be </p><p>what his nature makes him. But—Rose,” </p><p>he broke off suddenly, “are you engaged to </p><p>Hale?” </p><p> “No.” She was cruelly agitated. “He is</p><p>my best friend.” </p><p> “He’s a brick! But—nothing else?”</p><p> “No.”</p><p> He tore the top off a pine-bush and</p><p>crushed it in his hands. </p><p> “Rose, tell me honestly,” he pleaded</p><p>frankly, “what do you think of me?” </p><p>“What I—think of you?” She grasped </p><p>his arm, drawing him around so he must </p><p>meet her eyes. “How can you ask me that, </p><p>when you’ve done what you have for me?” </p><p>“No, no! Not that. You know what I </p><p>mean.” </p><p> Slowly she let go of his arm, and slowly</p><p>her eyes went to the ground. </p><p> “Oh, Gaston, Gaston!” she stammered.</p><p>“You charm me, you thrill me. You seem </p><p>to warm me and waken me when you come </p><p>near me, like the morning sun, or like a </p><p>fresh south wind in Spring. Yes, you’re like </p><p>that. Your smile is like the sun to me, real- </p><p>ly. There’s something in me that leaps up </p><p>and makes me want to—to go to you. But </p><p>there’s something about you that — that</p><p>frightens me, too. I don’t know what it is. </p><p>Oh, please, please, let’s go on up to the </p><p>others.” </p><p> “You bet,” he said, and promptly began</p><p>to help her up the hill toward the picnic </p><p>party. “But—have I got a chance?” </p><p> She did not reply. Her eyes rose and</p><p>met his and fell again. And he knew that </p><p>he could win her; that if he persisted she </p><p>would come to love him; that he could make </p><p>her his own. </p><p>CHAPTER XXXVI </p><p>SETTLING DOWN </p><p>FROM that moment he gravely set to </p><p>work to make himself fit to have the </p><p>right to claim her. He realized that he had </p><p>a difficult task before him. There was Hale, </p><p>Gaston Olaf </p><p>and Hale was in love with her, and would </p><p>make her the kind of husband she deserved. </p><p> She would marry Hale, Gaston knew, if</p><p>it were not for himself. And she would be </p><p>happy with Hale, too. So he had no right </p><p>to think of winning her unless he could make </p><p>sure that he would be as good a husband as </p><p>Hale. That was his task now: to be the </p><p>kind of a man who was fit to marry Rose </p><p>Havens. It would be a hard pull; but he </p><p>had done many hard things, and his confi- </p><p>dence in himself was unbounded. So he set </p><p>to work. </p><p> His first move was to call on Jack Mc-</p><p>Carthy in the latter’s place that evening. </p><p>He had selected McCarthy as the strong </p><p>man of the river-front. McCarthy greeted </p><p>him quietly and thrust forth a bottle and </p><p>two glasses. Gaston pushed them back. </p><p>“I’ll have a little water, Jack.” </p><p> Without a word McCarthy filled two</p><p>glasses with water. </p><p> “Here’s how?” said he. “Now—shoot.”</p><p>“For a start,” began Gaston, “you know </p><p>I’ve got no hard feelings against you. </p><p>You’re in this business, and that’s all right. </p><p>But I’ve been elected to keep order in this </p><p>town, and that’s my business. You’re the </p><p>leader down here, and that’s why I’m talk- </p><p>ing to you. The wild days are over in this </p><p>town. Pin that up over your register and </p><p>remember it. This gang down here doesn’t </p><p>run Havens Falls any longer. We’ve got </p><p>the whip-hand up in the other end of town, </p><p>and we’ve decided to make the place de- </p><p>cent. We aren’t going to interfere with you </p><p>unless you interfere with us. There’s a line </p><p>up there in the street. You fellows keep </p><p>this side of it! </p><p> “Don’t think I’m just talking. It’s seri-</p><p>ous. You fellows might tear loose and lick </p><p>us once. But we’re here to stay. You can </p><p>pass the word to the gang that their day’s </p><p>over. This is your side of the line; but </p><p>don’t let things get so wild that they spill </p><p>over on us. If you do, somebody will have </p><p>to leave town—and we’re high man. I’m </p><p>telling you this to avoid trouble.” </p><p>McCarthy nodded. </p><p> “I’ve seen it coming,” he said. “I’m get-</p><p>ting ready to move.”</p><p> Later that night Gaston took Red-Shirt</p><p>Murphy a mile down the river road and </p><p>pointed down-stream. </p><p> “Good-by, Murphy,” he said. “You’ve</p><p>had your day in Havens Falls, but you’re </p><p>leaving now. Don’t come back. It </p><p>wouldn’t be healthy. Lynching’s too good </p><p>for a man who’ll rob a kid; here’s what you </p><p>deserve— Hike!” </p><p> Red Shirt’s teeth rattled as Gaston’s right</p><p>foot lifted him in the air. The erstwhile </p><p>bad man picked himself up hurriedly. Gas- </p><p>ton was setting himself for another kick; </p><p>Murphy put his head down and ran, out of </p><p>sight, and out of Havens Falls. </p><p> Next, Gaston placed the deeds for his</p><p>own and Tom Pine’s timber claim in Loner- </p><p>gan’s hands. The railroad man added the </p><p>land to the holdings of his company. A few </p><p>days later he returned from La Croix with </p><p>deeds conveying to the two partners the </p><p>parcel of land which he had directed Gas- </p><p>ton to secure in Havens Falls. </p><p> “Now I feel sure of you,” said Lonergan,</p><p>when the last details of the transfer were </p><p>completed. “You’ll stick now.” </p><p> “What’s that?”</p><p> “I say you’ll stick here now. Was afraid</p><p>you’d quit us and go wandering. Don’t </p><p>want you to do it. We need you right here. </p><p>Feel sure of you now; a man usually sticks </p><p>in the spot where he’s got property.” </p><p> Tom Pine grumbled as he studied the</p><p>deeds. </p><p> “Town property,” he growled. “What</p><p>have I got to do with things like that? A </p><p>piece of timber-land, that’s all right. A </p><p>man can build his shack and camp on it if </p><p>he wants to. But I ain’t no town real-es- </p><p>tater, Gaston Olaf, you know that.” </p><p> “You can sell out pretty soon and get</p><p>enough to buy all the timber-land you </p><p>want,” replied Gaston. “This is our chance </p><p>to make a stake.” </p><p> Tom thought it over for a while.</p><p> “Yep; that’s all right for you, Gaston</p><p>Olaf—to make a stake,” he muttered. “But </p><p>for me, after it’s made, what am I going to </p><p>do with it?” </p><p> Nevertheless Tom Pine followed his lead-</p><p>er’s example, and, apparently, was resolved </p><p>upon settling down and becoming a perma- </p><p>nent resident of Havens Falls. He went to </p><p>work for Hale, who, backed by Lonergan, </p><p>was rebuilding the store. Tom worked </p><p>steadily through the lazy Spring days and </p><p>drew only such part of his pay as was neces- </p><p>sary for his expenses. </p><p>“If I had any loose money in my clothes, </p><p>I’d be apt to want to let ’er roar a little,” </p><p>he explained, “and Gaston Olaf being mar- </p><p>shal, ’twouldn’t be right of me to do that.” </p><p>Gaston, finding no immediate call for his </p><p>170 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>services as marshal, went to work on the </p><p>railroad. Lonergan had started his line </p><p>from both ends, and Gaston was placed in </p><p>charge of the clearing crew working out of </p><p>Havens Falls. He was a very different fore- </p><p>man than the one who had driven Tag- </p><p>gart’s men so ruthlessly. He worked so- </p><p>berly and steadily. </p><p> The line ran out through a forest of birch.</p><p>At times, when the white trunks of the </p><p>trees glistened in the warm Spring sun, </p><p>when the rapidly growing leaves waved laz- </p><p>ily in the slight breeze, and a dozen varieties </p><p>of birds made the woods alive with their </p><p>songs and plumage, he was moved to leap </p><p>into the air and shout from sheer joy of liv- </p><p>ing. He didn’t do it, however. At such </p><p>times he thought of what he was working </p><p>for, and with tightly pressed lips seriously </p><p>went on with his duties. </p><p> There was only one thing to worry him</p><p>now. Taggart had sobered up and had re- </p><p>turned to his office, as cold and masterful </p><p>apparently as ever. It was his busy sea- </p><p>son. His drives were behind the booms, </p><p>and he was occupied with the work of turn- </p><p>ing the Winter’s harvest into money. </p><p> Gaston agreed with his associates not to</p><p>trouble Taggart so long as he did not </p><p>trouble them. He did not for an instant </p><p>fancy that Taggart had dropped the feud. </p><p>He kept his skin whole in those days only </p><p>by his unflagging vigilance, and by showing </p><p>Taggart and his men that he was not to be </p><p>caught off his guard. The strain brought </p><p>new fines about his mouth. What new dev- </p><p>iltry was Taggart planning? When would </p><p>he show it, and how? </p><p> Gaston’s natural impulse was to rush to</p><p>meet Taggart face to face and have it over </p><p>with, one way or another, in one final clash. </p><p>He held his peace, however, a trying thing </p><p>for him to do with an enemy in sight. His </p><p>natural impulses were under complete con- </p><p>trol—for the time being. </p><p>CHAPTER XXXVII </p><p>A STORM BREWING </p><p>TAGGART’S old gang had been thor-</p><p>oughly broken up. A few of its mem- </p><p>bers, who had taken only a small part in the </p><p>memorable night fight, came drifting back, </p><p>carefully feeling out the ground and ready </p><p>to flee at the first sign of hostility. </p><p>The fight had been taken out of them. </p><p>Craven at heart, they saw that power in the </p><p>settlement had passed from Taggart to the </p><p>decent element, and they sought at once to </p><p>curry favor with the latter. Here, however, </p><p>they met rebuffs. </p><p> Gaston pointed to the line he had drawn</p><p>in the street. </p><p> “You made your choice that night,” he</p><p>reminded them. “Get back where you be- </p><p>long. Nobody will trust you up here. We </p><p>won’t bother you if you don’t bother us, but </p><p>—you’re not wanted.” </p><p> The leaders of the gang followed Mur-</p><p>phy’s example and did not return. The </p><p>gangsters who had come back hung meekly </p><p>around the river-front, and law and order </p><p>were undisturbed in Havens Falls. </p><p> “Pretty dull, ain’t it, Gaston Olaf?” com-</p><p>mented Tom Pine one Saturday evening as </p><p>they sat before the hotel and looked down </p><p>toward the river-front. “ ’Member how it </p><p>used to be on a Sat’day night, down there? </p><p>Now—why, you can’t scare up enough ex- </p><p>citement to start a sweat.” </p><p> “Don’t want to start any excitement,”</p><p>retorted Gaston. “This is just the way we </p><p>want it, nice, quiet and orderly.” </p><p> Tom Pine heaved a sigh.</p><p> “Yes; but it gets darn good and dull</p><p>sometimes, you’ll admit me that, Gaston </p><p>Olaf?” </p><p> “I’ll admit nothing of the sort,” was the</p><p>reply. “This is the way I want things; I’ve </p><p>worked to make things this way; don’t want </p><p>any foolish excitement any more. Besides,” </p><p>his eyes lighted up, “there’ll be plenty of </p><p>excitement before long. Taggart isn’t go- </p><p>ing to lay quiet much longer.” </p><p> “Taggart? Hm, hm. What about Tag-</p><p>gart, Big Fellow?” </p><p> Dr. Sanders, coming to see Hulda, stop-</p><p>ped for a moment’s chat. Gaston repeated </p><p>his remark. The doctor shook his head. </p><p> “Hm, hm. Don’t agree with you, Gas-</p><p>ton. Old Devil Dave is a bear, sure enough, </p><p>but he isn’t exactly mad with the heat. No </p><p>one man is going to try to buck a whole </p><p>settlement by himself, and Taggart’s gang </p><p>is gone—busted.” </p><p> “But the old man isn’t,” insisted Gaston.</p><p>“He’ll bear a lot of watching yet. The old </p><p>gang is gone, sure; but there’s nothing to </p><p>keep him from getting another.” </p><p> The doctor passed on inside, and Tom</p><p>Pine lighted his pipe and went for a stroll. </p><p>After a while Gaston rose and went down </p><p>the street to the river-front. </p><p>Gaston Olaf </p><p>171 </p><p> As he passed McCarthy’s he glanced</p><p>through the open door and stopped in sur- </p><p>prise. McCarthy was not in sight. Where </p><p>he was accustomed to stand on Saturday </p><p>nights stood a heavy, crop-headed man with </p><p>the flat face and figure of a Slav. Impelled </p><p>by curiosity Gaston entered. New bartend- </p><p>ers, of the same type as the man in front, </p><p>were behind the bar. The crowd, likewise, </p><p>was different, squat, flat-faced foreigners, </p><p>talking in a strange, guttural tgngue. </p><p> “Hullo, Boss,” greeted Gaston, “where’s</p><p>McCarthy?” </p><p> “Gone ’way,” was the guttural response.</p><p>“Dis place mine now.” </p><p> Gaston recalled what McCarthy had said</p><p>about getting ready to move. </p><p> “You’ve bought McCarthy out?”</p><p> “Yess. An’t’ing elsse you want know?”</p><p> A snicker ran around the crowd. Gaston,</p><p>looking at their flat evil faces, saw they were </p><p>regarding him with sneers. Anger flared up </p><p>within him. Hot words sprang to his </p><p>tongue; but he caught himself in time. </p><p> “No; that’s all,” he said patiently and</p><p>turned to go. </p><p> The proprietor followed him to the door.</p><p> “I hear ’bout you. You run diss town,</p><p>hah? By-! You won’ run Jan Ulnick’s </p><p>place. Jan Ulnick, Polska Saloon, see? </p><p>Dat’s wha’ diss goin’ be. Polish manns </p><p>goin’ work for Bahss Taggar’. See? Bahss </p><p>tell us all ’bout you. You tink you want to </p><p>monk’ with us, hah? We don’ stand dat, </p><p>see?” </p><p> “I see,” replied Gaston, and hurried to</p><p>get himself away before his rage could mas- </p><p>ter him. </p><p> He went at once to Lonergan, who was</p><p>in town, and told what he had discovered. </p><p>Lonergan had an old Pole in the crew at </p><p>that end of the line, a man who had been </p><p>with him for years and whom he could trust.</p><p>This man he sent to mingle with the crowd </p><p>at McCarthy’s old place and learn all he </p><p>could. The old man returned within an </p><p>hour, shaking his head. </p><p> “It is Jan Ulnick, the bad saloon-keeper</p><p>from over on the Iron Range,” he reported. </p><p>“The men with him are bad men, miners </p><p>who would not work, who are driven out of </p><p>the mines. Ulnick had a bad place over </p><p>there. He is driven out by the sheriff, and </p><p>these men with him. Taggart sends for </p><p>them. He tells them this is a place they </p><p>can do as they please in, no sheriff, nobody </p><p>to stop them—if they do not let the people </p><p> here bluff them. He tells them the people</p><p>here are great bluffers, but they are afraid </p><p>of bad, strong men. Ulnick buys out Mc- </p><p>Carthy. Taggart promises the rest work. </p><p>Other bad saloon-keepers and men are com- </p><p>ing from the Range. They say nobody had </p><p>better monkey with them.” </p><p> Lonergan looked silently at Gaston as</p><p>the old man finished his story, and Gaston </p><p>looked back. The railroad man shook his </p><p>head. </p><p> “Our friend Taggart is a great man,” said</p><p>he, “great general, great politician, great or- </p><p>ganizer—gone wrong.” </p><p> “I knew he was about due to make a</p><p>move,” said Gaston. “But I never looked </p><p>for this.” </p><p> “He couldn’t have made a better one,</p><p>from his point of view,” continued Loner- </p><p>gan. “He knows that he could never get </p><p>another gang of white men around him here. </p><p>They’ve all heard of what happened to the </p><p>old gang. You’ve busted the old man’s </p><p>grip. He had to get hold of a crew that </p><p>didn’t know what had happened here, and </p><p>wouldn’t understand if they did. These ig- </p><p>norant, pig - faced Hunyaks fill the bill. </p><p>Taggart is himself again.” </p><p> “He’s a fox and a wolf,” admitted Gas-</p><p>ton. “We’re too strong for him now, </p><p>though.” </p><p> Lonergan scratched his head dubiously.</p><p>“I dunno about that, Thorson. Of </p><p>course, Taggart’s out for one kind of game, </p><p>you understand that?” </p><p> “The first job he’ll set these Hunyaks at</p><p>is to put me out of business,” agreed Gas- </p><p>ton quietly. • </p><p> “Yes. And if they succeed in doing that</p><p>—well, you know what it will look like: </p><p>Taggart will be Big Chief again, and God </p><p>help Havens Falls!” </p><p> “That’s it. And that’s why I’m not go-</p><p>ing to take any chances.” </p><p> “What’s your program, Thorson?”</p><p> “Keep out of their way as much as pos-</p><p>sible. Leave them alone if they leave us </p><p>alone. B ut if they get so bad we can’t stand </p><p>’em-” </p><p> He stopped abruptly with a snap of his</p><p>teeth and stood looking with flashing eyes </p><p>toward the river-front. </p><p> “Then what?”</p><p> Gaston’s teeth gleamed white as he</p><p>smiled. </p><p> “Law and order,” said he. “Law and</p><p>order forever!” </p><p>172 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Tom Pine heaved a sigh of relief when he</p><p>heard of the new situation. </p><p> “Then there’ll be something happening,”</p><p>said he contentedly. “Hunyaks are lambs </p><p>when they’re alone, but wolves when you </p><p>get ’em in a pack. They’ll be trying to run </p><p>us out. Nacherly, we won’t go. There’ll </p><p>be some excitement then. We need it. </p><p>Things have been mighty dull.” </p><p> In the next few days it developed that</p><p>Lonergan’s man had reported the situation </p><p>correctly. One by one the old saloon-keep- </p><p>ers of the front sold out, and men of Ul- </p><p>nick’s type took their places. The dives </p><p>and the dance-hall changed hands last of </p><p>all. There was a complete change in the </p><p>personnel of the front. The newcomers </p><p>brought women with them. The river-front </p><p>was in their hands and under Ulnick’s lead- </p><p>ership. </p><p> Save for this threatening change, Havens</p><p>Falls would have been gloriously content </p><p>with itself during those bright days of </p><p>Spring. It was experiencing the first thrill </p><p>of a boom, and the optimism of a boom- </p><p>town was its to a considerable degree. </p><p> That a railroad was being built up to the</p><p>settlement was in itself enough to start the </p><p>enthusiasm. Settlers began to come in; </p><p>merchants followed them. The rattle of </p><p>hammers echoed ceaselessly throughout the </p><p>warm days. Houses were thrown up swift- </p><p>ly. Lots were staked out and sold, build- </p><p>ing lots, where a few weeks before rabbits </p><p>had romped undisturbed. </p><p> Plans were made to apply for a city char-</p><p>ter, to build a school and a church. Hale’s </p><p>new stock came in by the wagon-load. Had </p><p>it not been for the new crowd in the river- </p><p>front the settlement would have whooped </p><p>with joy. </p><p> The river-front grew more threatening</p><p>day by day. Taggart was discharging all </p><p>his old men and replacing them with for- </p><p>eigners. These men grew more and more </p><p>insolent toward the townspeople. </p><p> Then one day it became known that Tag-</p><p>gart had started drinking again. Nobody</p><p>was surprised. Having by choice surround- </p><p>ed himself with a swinish crew, he proceeded </p><p>to sink himself to their level. Gaston knew </p><p>that the inevitable clash would come before </p><p>Taggart was over this spree. </p><p> “Inevitable, hm, hm, inevitable that he’d</p><p>do that,” commented Dr. Sanders. “In- </p><p>stincts all wrong, you know. Whisky and </p><p>women; he can’t rise above them. The </p><p>whisky has been getting him, too, this last </p><p>year. His debauches have been a little, hm, </p><p>hm,' a little too inhuman even for him to </p><p>stand. Nerves torn to pieces; system cry- </p><p>ing periodically for excesses, each one worse </p><p>than the last. He’ll go to pieces; had the </p><p>willies a couple times. Go to pieces sure; </p><p>likely to do damage when he does.” </p><p> One quiet evening the doctor, visiting</p><p>Hulda at the hotel, was sent for to come </p><p>down to one of the dives. His patient was </p><p>an unfortunate woman; her thin, miserable </p><p>arm had been broken above the elbow by a </p><p>blow. In a corner of the room sat Taggart, </p><p>holding a broken whisky bottle by the neck, </p><p>leering insanely, his eyes popping, his head </p><p>jerking about helplessly. </p><p> “Fix her up, Doc; want to teach her</p><p>’nother lesson,” he sneered. “Teach ’em all </p><p>lessons. I’m king here—flwn ’em—body ’n’ </p><p>soul.” </p><p> Dr. Sanders, the professional instinct up-</p><p>permost, before he left the place spoke once </p><p>to Taggart. </p><p> “Taggart, as a physician, I must warn</p><p>you: if you continue this spree any longer </p><p>you’re as good as dead.” </p><p> “Wrong, Doc; dead wrong,” sneered Tag-</p><p>gart promptly. “Another man’ll die of it; </p><p>not me. His name’s Thorson. I’ll show </p><p>’im. He’s the one who’s good as dead.” </p><p>Gaston tightened his lips as Dr. Sanders </p><p>told him of this. </p><p> “It’ll come now; he’ll run wild, like a mad</p><p>dog,” said he. “Well, the sooner the better.” </p><p>Tom Pine likewise grew serious as he </p><p>heard the doctor repeat Taggart’s words. </p><p> “That means the old devil’s set a trap for</p><p>you, Gaston Olaf.” </p><p> “Sure.”</p><p> “And he’s got them Hunyaks with him</p><p>this time—too many of ’em.” </p><p> “Sure again.”</p><p> There was a long silence. Dr. Sanders</p><p>stroked his beard nervously; Gaston sat </p><p>looking at the ground. At last Tom Pine </p><p>rose casually, clearing his throat. </p><p> “Guess I’ll go for a little walk before</p><p>turning in,” he said, striving to speak care- </p><p>lessly, but his effort betrayed him. </p><p> “You’ve walked enough today,” said Gas-</p><p>ton, catching him by the arm. “Sit down. </p><p>Don’t you go starting a little war against </p><p>Taggart by yourself. I’ve told you that </p><p>doesn’t go any more here.” </p><p> “It’s the easiest way, Gaston Olaf,” pro-</p><p>tested Tom. “He’s raving with liquor now. </p><p>Gaston Olaf </p><p>173 </p><p>He’d try to get me on first sight. Then it’d </p><p>be all over in two shakes of a doe’s tail, and </p><p>those Hunyaks would be easy to handle </p><p>with the old man gone.” </p><p> “It doesn’t go,” repeated Gaston firmly.</p><p>“No,” agreed Dr. Sanders with a sigh, </p><p>“it doesn’t go. Law and order. Hm, hm. </p><p>We can’t break the law.” </p><p> There was more silence.</p><p> “No use telling anybody what he said</p><p>about me,” said Gaston finally. “It </p><p>wouldn’t do any good, and it might cause </p><p>some worry.” </p><p> As they were about to part, Dr. Sanders</p><p>hung back, tugging at his beard, and with </p><p>many hm, hm’s, indicating that something </p><p>was on his mind. </p><p> “Out with it, Doc,” said Gaston.</p><p>“What’s troubling you?” </p><p> “Well — hm, hm — you know, I’d like</p><p>things to run along for the next week or so </p><p>without any trouble. We’re going to get </p><p>married, the girl and myself, a week from </p><p>today. She’d feel a lot better, you know, if </p><p>things went along smooth and safe at this </p><p>time.” </p><p> “Well?”</p><p> “Hm, hm. I’m pretty sure I know a way</p><p>out of this without any trouble for the pres- </p><p>ent, Thorson.” </p><p> “What is it?”</p><p> “This: Taggart is going to pieces rapid-</p><p>ly. He’s sure to be laid up a while at least </p><p>after this awful spree. He can’t do any- </p><p>thing then. If the trouble doesn’t come </p><p>while he’s on this drunk, it may not come </p><p>at all. Anyhow it’ll be delayed.” </p><p> “Go on.”</p><p> “Well, the way his crazy mind is running</p><p>now, it’s only you that he’s really after. If </p><p>you weren’t here—if you should go out of </p><p>town until this spree puts Taggart on his </p><p>back-” </p><p> But Gaston clouded up darkly.</p><p> “No, sir!” he snapped. “I left town once</p><p>on account of Taggart. I won’t do it again. </p><p>Don’t ask it. This time one of us is going </p><p>away for good.” </p><p>CHAPTER XXXVIII </p><p>“wait, gaston!” </p><p>Z"' ASTON sat alone for a long time after </p><p>the doctor had gone. So Sanders and </p><p>Hulda were going to get married. The </p><p>carefree, sport-loving bachelor had met his </p><p>fate. In the quiet blue eyes of Hulda he </p><p>had found something that was more to him </p><p>than his whisky-bottle, more than his bach- </p><p>elorhood, more than all the wild freedom of </p><p>the life he hitherto had led. </p><p> The doc was going to settle down. He</p><p>had given up the whisky altogether. Sam- </p><p>son no longer ruled in the back room. The </p><p>doctor had ceased to volunteer his services </p><p>as referee at every fight that came within </p><p>his ken. He had substituted sober, pro- </p><p>fessional black for his gaudy waistcoats, and </p><p>he was building a house for himself and </p><p>Hulda. </p><p> Gaston smiled as he contemplated the</p><p>change that had come over the doctor in the </p><p>last few weeks. He was sensible that he had </p><p>come to regard Sanders in a different light. </p><p>At first he had merely liked him as a good </p><p>fellow; now he respected him as a physician </p><p>and as a man. </p><p> So the doctor and Hulda were to marry.</p><p>And they would settle down in the house </p><p>they were building. They would have a </p><p>home. Children would come to them; the </p><p>doctor would know the sober thrill of hold- </p><p>ing in his arms his first-born, flesh of his </p><p>flesh, bone of his bone. As the town grew </p><p>the doctor’s practise would grow. He would </p><p>be a big man, settled and all that, with his </p><p>woman at his side. </p><p> Lucky doctor! He had found content-</p><p>ment, even happiness. Gaston began to </p><p>dream. His quick imagination pictured </p><p>himself in the doctor’s place. He saw Rose </p><p>moving about him—about their home—</p><p>tripping lightly on her tiny feet, her face </p><p>alight with joy. Was there anything better </p><p>in the world than that? </p><p> “Whip - er - will; whip-er-will; whip - er-</p><p>will!” suddenly cried a whippoorwill down </p><p>by the river. </p><p> Startled, Gaston looked in its direction.</p><p>He saw the river-front, red with lights, </p><p>heard a sudden shout of drunken song, and </p><p>his brow clouded. </p><p> “Better have that settled before you be-</p><p>gin planning,” he told himself. “You may </p><p>not be here to plan after that’s over.” </p><p> To rid himself of these dark thoughts he</p><p>rose and walked up to where Dr. Sanders </p><p>was building his new home. To his surprise </p><p>he saw that the house was less than half </p><p>finished. It would be impossible at the rate </p><p>it was going to have it completed by the </p><p>day set for the wedding. </p><p> “Huh! That isn’t right,” he mused.</p><p>174 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>“The doc and Hulda ought to have their </p><p>own house ready to move into!” A gleam </p><p>of amusement crossed his face. The dark </p><p>thoughts were forgotten. “Yes, by Jupi- </p><p>ter! and they’re going to have it, too,” he </p><p>said and went home to bed smiling boyishly. </p><p> Next morning he broached his idea to</p><p>Hale. </p><p> “We owe it to the doc,” he explained.</p><p>“He’s a good fellow. We’ll give ’em a build- </p><p>ing-bee and have the house all ready for </p><p>them.” </p><p> Hale promptly fell in with the idea.</p><p> “The store can wait,” he said, and turned</p><p>himself and his builders over to the new </p><p>project. </p><p> Gaston explained to Lonergan why he</p><p>would leave the crew for a week. </p><p> “Sure,” said Lonergan. “Need any more</p><p>men?” </p><p> Dr. Sanders rubbed his eyes when he</p><p>came forth to inspect the progress of his </p><p>building. </p><p> “Hm, hm! What’s this, what’s this?” he</p><p>demanded. </p><p> Gaston, in the act of lifting a rafter into</p><p>place, laughed down at him. </p><p> “Tom Pine and I want your old shack,”</p><p>he said, “so we’ve decided to get this one </p><p>finished for you in a hurry.” </p><p> “Hm, hm. All right,” said the doctor.</p><p>“Do the same for you some time.” </p><p> The finishing of the doctor’s house be-</p><p>came a lark for the whole settlement. Other </p><p>building stopped for the time being while </p><p>the builders devoted themselves to the </p><p>building-“bee.” From the rapidly growing </p><p>structure rose a constant rat-tat-tat of ham- </p><p>mers, punctuated by the jests and laughter </p><p>of the crowd of workers. As they worked </p><p>they considered the situation seriously. </p><p> “The doc was fig’ring on a quiet wedding,</p><p>but that won’t do,” said one enthusiast. </p><p>“Now that we’ve started on it we might’s </p><p>well do it up brown. Let’s make it a holi- </p><p>day, and everybody lay off and give ’em a </p><p>send-off that’ll do the town proud.” </p><p> The idea was greeted with acclamation.</p><p>It was the first wedding of importance in </p><p>the settlement, and the pioneers determined </p><p>to make it a memorable event. The work </p><p>on the house went on with increased speed. </p><p> Two days before the day set for the wed-</p><p>ding Gaston climbed to the peak of the roof </p><p>and fastened a small flag, donated by Post- </p><p>master Perkins, to the tin chimney. The </p><p>crowd gathered before the house, compris- </p><p>ing every man, woman and child of the re- </p><p>spectable portion of Havens Falls, waved </p><p>hats and handkerchiefs and cheered lustily. </p><p>The house was finished and ready for the </p><p>doctor and Hulda to occupy. </p><p> As Gaston came clambering down from</p><p>the roof he met Rose leading a corps of wo- </p><p>men into the building. Some carried </p><p>brooms, others carried curtains, plants, car- </p><p>pet pieces and other articles of furniture and </p><p>decoration. </p><p> “Your job is done here, Mr. Man,” she</p><p>said gaily. “Now the ladies come on the </p><p>scene to beautify the labor of men’s hands.” </p><p>“That’s what they always do,” he re- </p><p>plied. “Men can’t do anything but put up </p><p>the bare walls; it’s you women who make a </p><p>home out of a place.” </p><p> “Of course. But a woman can’t make a</p><p>home unless there’s a man to do the build- </p><p>ing. You see, we’re dependent on each </p><p>other.” </p><p> “Yes. And each has got to be depend-</p><p>able.” He looked the house over. “The </p><p>doctor and Hulda will be happy here, all </p><p>right; they’re both the dependable kind.” </p><p>Rose laughed, a trifle mischievously. </p><p>“Certainly they’ll be happy. Hulda’s </p><p>started mothering him already, and the doc- </p><p>tor is the kind of man who needs and likes </p><p>to be mothered. Oh, yes; they’ll be happy. </p><p>Hulda’ll be the boss in a month; and Dr. </p><p>Sanders knows it and is glad of it.” </p><p> Gaston gazed at her, wide-eyed with ad-</p><p>miration.</p><p> “That’s so. I can see it, now that you’ve</p><p>spoken of it. How did you know it? Can </p><p>you read all men like that?” </p><p> “No.” She grew serious. “No, some</p><p>men a woman can’t read at all. It’s all </p><p>plain in the doctor’s case; he—he’s just a </p><p>nice, ordinary man.” </p><p> “Some men aren’t—nice and ordinary?”</p><p>“Aren’t ordinary,” she corrected. “They </p><p>—oh, I don’t know. Gaston,” she said, </p><p>looking straight at him, “I wonder if I will </p><p>ever know you. You’re so full of surprises. </p><p>One day I think of you as fierce—no, not </p><p>that—as restless and reckless. Sort of a </p><p>wild, strange spirit. And then you do </p><p>something sweet and pretty, like getting </p><p>this house finished, so they’ll have their own </p><p>home to move into when they’re married. </p><p>What a jolly idea that was!” </p><p> “I like to see folks have homes,” he said</p><p>lamely. </p><p> “Yes. I know you do.”</p><p>Gaston Olaf </p><p>175 </p><p> “I want a home of.jny own,” he whis-</p><p>pered hoarsely. </p><p> She looked at him tenderly for a moment.</p><p>“Gaston,” she said softly, “are you sure </p><p>that you do? Are you sure that you want </p><p>that more than—your freedom? For you </p><p>know—you know you can not have them </p><p>both.” </p><p> “I am sure—” he began, but checked</p><p>himself. He hesitated, his eyes on the </p><p>ground. “If I was sure, Rose-” </p><p> “But you’re not, Gaston!” she whispered</p><p>haltingly. “You’re not! I can see it. </p><p>You’re not sure yet; you know you’re </p><p>not.” </p><p> Within him he felt an all but uncontrol-</p><p>lable impulse to reply firmly that, yes, he </p><p>was sure. The impulse sprang from the very </p><p>roots of his being. It cried out to him to </p><p>swear that he was sure, to dominate her, to </p><p>make her believe it was so, to take her for </p><p>his own. </p><p> His lips even opened to utter the words.</p><p>He trembled, and for an instant his blue </p><p>eyes were clouded with the agony of his </p><p>struggle. The selfishness of the young male </p><p>rose strong in him. He wanted her so much, </p><p>and, whispered impulse, it would be so easy </p><p>to convince her that he was sure; it would </p><p>even be easy to convince himself. </p><p> His lips were parted; the words came</p><p>rushing to his tongue; and then he clicked </p><p>his jaws together and threw up his head. </p><p>His eyes were clear again now, and some- </p><p>thing finer than yearning, something finer </p><p>even than the light of love itself, was gleam- </p><p>ing in the deep blue of them. </p><p> “Rose—” his voice was normal and</p><p>steady again—“I don’t know whether I am </p><p>sure.” </p><p> She nodded gravely.</p><p> “I knew you weren’t sure, Gaston. I</p><p>could feel it.” </p><p> “When I am sure, do you think you could</p><p>feel that, too?” </p><p> Again she nodded.</p><p> “If ever you are sure, I think I would</p><p>feel that, too.” </p><p> “ ‘If’? Then you don’t think-”</p><p> She turned away without reply.</p><p> “If I do come to know that I’m sure,” he</p><p>persisted, “and you feel it, what then?” </p><p> She turned back and looked at him for a</p><p>long time. </p><p> “Gaston,” she said, “I like you, and I like</p><p>Dick Hale. But you are trying to make me </p><p>more than like you. Oh, Gaston! You </p><p>mustn’t talk to me like this unless you be- </p><p>come sure of yourself.” </p><p> “Forgive me,” he whispered penitently.</p><p>“I’ll never speak another word of it—unless </p><p>I’m sure I have the right.” </p><p> She held out her hand impulsively.</p><p>“Shake!” she said, smiling. “Now I must </p><p>get to work.” </p><p> As she turned to join the other women,</p><p>Hale came up, his arms filled with rolls of </p><p>wall-paper. Rose eagerly tore open a roll </p><p>to look at the pattern. </p><p> “Oh, Dick!” she cried. “What perfect</p><p>taste you’ve got! Such a dainty blue, and </p><p>those tiny flowers! Won’t it make their sit- </p><p>ting-room perfectly darling!” </p><p> They went inside, Rose fairly skipping</p><p>with eagerness while Hale smiled patiently. </p><p>Gaston, looking after them, smiled also; but </p><p>he only did so because it was natural for </p><p>him to smile when he was hit hard. </p><p> “Come on, Thorson,” called a man from</p><p>behind the house, and Gaston roused him- </p><p>self. “Where are we going to build the </p><p>dance floor?” </p><p> That was another idea which the settle-</p><p>ment had conceived to aid in celebrating </p><p>the wedding. They were going to have a </p><p>dance, of course. What would a wedding </p><p>be without a dance? An orchestra was to</p><p>be brought up from La Croix, not merely a </p><p>couple of fiddlers, but a real orchestra, in- </p><p>cluding horns and a trap-drummer. </p><p> It would be a celebration to attract</p><p>such a crowd as never yet had been known </p><p>north of La Croix. Would there be room </p><p>for everybody to dance in the doctor’s new </p><p>house? Obviously there would not be. </p><p>Thus it was resolved to splurge and lay </p><p>down an outdoor dancing-floor which would </p><p>send the fame of Havens Falls flying broad- </p><p>cast throughout the woods. </p><p> The men turned from the building of the</p><p>house to the laying of the floor. While some </p><p>put down the boards others went into the </p><p>swamp and cut a wagon-load of small ever- </p><p>green trees. These were fastened upright </p><p>around the floor, enclosing it in four odor- </p><p>ous green walls. </p><p> To further embellish the scene, Postmas-</p><p>ter Perkins brought forth a roll of old bunt- </p><p>ing. The boys cheered. It reminded them </p><p>of the Fourth of July. </p><p> On the night before the wedding it was</p><p>all complete. The house was ready for oc- </p><p>cupancy; the orchestra was in town; the </p><p>floor was in shape. Hale had gone to La </p><p>176 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Croix to drive the minister up in the morn- </p><p>ing, and it awaited only the morning for </p><p>the celebration to begin. </p><p> “Well,” said Gaston, as he and Tom Pine</p><p>quit work that evening, “I’m surprised they </p><p>let us get that done without a hitch.” </p><p> Tom whistled.</p><p> “You mean those Hunyaks and Taggart?</p><p>You been thinking about them, tod?” </p><p> “I couldn’t hardly forget them, could I?</p><p>They’ve been noisy enough every night. </p><p>They’ve left us strictly alone, though, and </p><p>that looks bad. Taggart must have been </p><p>holding ’em in, though he’s plumb crazy </p><p>from drinking. If he has, it’s only been for </p><p>one thing.” </p><p> “Tomorrow, you mean, Gaston Olaf?”</p><p>“Yes, it would be like the old devil to </p><p>save his worst stroke for a day like tomor- </p><p>row.” </p><p> Tom Pine grew thoughtful. He retired</p><p>early to his room. From the window of the </p><p>room he could look down the river-front </p><p>from end to end. </p><p> Tom carefully oiled his rifle and Gaston’s,</p><p>tried levers and triggers, loaded the maga- </p><p>zines to the brim, and went to bed. In the </p><p>morning he complained of excruciating pains </p><p>in his left leg, alleging that he had strained </p><p>it the day before. Besides, his rheumatism </p><p>always bothered him that time of the year, </p><p>he said. It would be necessary, he declared, </p><p>for him to keep to his bed most of the day, </p><p>lest the trouble become aggravated. </p><p> Gaston laughed, knowing well Tom’s dis-</p><p>like for conventional festivities and recog- </p><p>nizing a subterfuge. But Tom had moved </p><p>his bed so he could lie on it and look out of </p><p>the window upon the river-front. </p><p>CHAPTER XXXIX </p><p>TAGGART STRIKES </p><p>THE day of the wedding dawned clear, </p><p>cool and sunny. A slight breeze, blow- </p><p>ing from the woods toward the river, car-</p><p>ried over the town the many fresh odors of </p><p>northern woods in the full bloom of early </p><p>Summer. There was the odor of balsam in </p><p>the air, and of budding tamaracks and </p><p>spruce. </p><p> Up from the swamp came the smell of</p><p>cowslips and yellow - headed water - lilies, </p><p>while from the sunny sides of the surround- </p><p>ing hills there came drifting down the gen- </p><p>tle odor of dying woods violets, which in </p><p>spots covered the ground like a carpet. Up </p><p>above, against the sky, tiny specks of white </p><p>clouds shared with a pair of lazily soaring </p><p>hawks in the vast blue dome of the heav- </p><p>ens. The birds of the forest, with no clat- </p><p>ter of hammering to alarm them, drew near, </p><p>and in the stillness of the morning their </p><p>clear notes ringed the settlement around </p><p>with song. It was a day when the whole </p><p>world seemed glad and filled with young life </p><p>—a day fit for the wedding of a Hulda. </p><p> The people of the settlement, and their</p><p>visitors, appeared early, dressed for the oc- </p><p>casion. Postmaster Perkins was solemnly </p><p>gorgeous in ancient swallow-tailed coat, high </p><p>leather boots, hickory shirt and wide-brim- </p><p>med G. A. R. hat. Lonergan even went </p><p>further—he wore a new suit of black, a stiff </p><p>shirt and collar! </p><p> From these extremes of fashion the ap-</p><p>parel of the men ranged to the fringed buck- </p><p>skin shirts and trousers of the trappers who </p><p>had come in from the woods for the occa- </p><p>sion. Most of the women and girls man- </p><p>aged to display something new in the way </p><p>of dress, sash or ribbon. Some of the girls </p><p>were spick-and-span in white dresses with </p><p>wide blue sashes. A few Indians waddled </p><p>stolidly about in blankets and moccasins. </p><p> The wedding was set for “high noon,” as</p><p>the editor at La Croix wrote in his next </p><p>week’s issue. After the ceremony, dinner </p><p>was to be served, and then the dancing was </p><p>to begin. </p><p> In the private recesses of Olson’s Hotel,</p><p>Rose and other women had Hulda prepared </p><p>for the event an hour before the time set. </p><p>It was with difficulty that Hulda was re- </p><p>strained from doing her share of the work </p><p>about the hotel that morning. Only after </p><p>she saw that neighbors were efficiently as- </p><p>sisting her mother, did she agree to “sit like</p><p>a loafer,” as she expressed it. </p><p> When fully dressed for her wedding Hul-</p><p>da’s appearance threw her attendants into </p><p>ecstasies of delight. Of all the women pres- </p><p>ent she was the only one serene and undis- </p><p>turbed. Even in stiffly starched white, and </p><p>laced to within an inch of her life, the mag- </p><p>nificent freedom of her body was untram- </p><p>melled. The red and cream of her com- </p><p>plexion was a trifle heightened by excite- </p><p>ment; her steady blue eyes were serene with </p><p>happiness and triumph; down her back two </p><p>thick braids of yellow-golden hair fell be- </p><p>low her waist. At times she blushed slight- </p><p>ly- </p><p>Gaston Olaf </p><p>177 </p><p> In the doctor’s bachelor quarters Dr.</p><p>Sanders, in the hands of Gaston and Loner- </p><p>gan, sat fully dressed, waiting for the noon </p><p>hour with all the serenity and composure of </p><p>a man about to be hanged for stealing sheep. </p><p>To further his comfort his two companions </p><p>assured him that the agony of waiting was </p><p>nothing compared to what he would ex- </p><p>perience during the ceremony. </p><p> “Wait until you get up there before the</p><p>minister with everybody looking at you,” </p><p>encouraged Gaston. “Then you’ll have </p><p>something to get cold sweats about.” </p><p> The doctor retorted with an old shoe,</p><p>which Gaston ducked laughingly. </p><p> Lonergan looked at his watch.</p><p> “Hello! Ten minutes after eleven. Hale</p><p>and the preacher are about due.” </p><p> “Maybe they’ll be late; maybe some-</p><p>thing’s happened; maybe they can’t come.” </p><p>The doctor grasped at the straws eagerly. </p><p> “Oh, no,” Gaston assured him. “Noth-</p><p>ing’s happened. Hale will be here on time. </p><p>You can’t escape. A few minutes more now </p><p>and we’ll be leading you out where the </p><p>crowd can get one last, fond look at you.” </p><p>Dr. Sanders swung to the window, </p><p>glanced out and retreated. </p><p> “Whew! Everybody in town’s ready and</p><p>waiting. Regular mob. Hm, hm. You’d </p><p>think they’d never seen a wedding the way </p><p>they’re waiting—think it was a show.” </p><p> “It is,” chuckled Gaston. “Take my</p><p>word for it, Doc, you’ll be a show all by </p><p>yourself.” </p><p> “It’s an almighty quiet crowd,” said Lon-</p><p>ergan speculatively. “The boys are stay- </p><p>ing away from the saloons.” </p><p> “They all like doc and respect the trouble</p><p>he’s going through.” </p><p> “Quiet down in the river-front, too.</p><p>Wonder if they’re doing that because there’s </p><p>a little decency left in ’em?” </p><p> “What time is it?” cried the doctor petu-</p><p>lantly. “Darn it! Why doesn’t Hale show </p><p>up? Said he’d be here about eleven, didn’t </p><p>he? If he’s coming, why doesn’t he come </p><p>and have it over with?” </p><p> A number of women passed the office, go-</p><p>ing toward the new house. </p><p> “They’re beginning to assemble in your</p><p>honor, Doc,” laughed Gaston. “Your time </p><p>draws nigh. All we’re waiting for now is </p><p>the preacher.” </p><p> “Maybe he won’t come,” insisted the doc-</p><p>tor hopefully. “Maybe we’ll have to put it </p><p>off.” </p><p> They sat in silence for a while. Again</p><p>Lonergan looked at his watch. </p><p> “Twenty minutes after eleven,” he said.</p><p>“They’ll be here now, or something’s hap- </p><p>pened.” </p><p> Gaston and the railroad builder stepped</p><p>outside and looked down the street. The </p><p>road from La Croix ran along the river; </p><p>Hale and the minister would have to </p><p>drive through the river-front when they </p><p>came. </p><p> “Not in sight yet,” said Lonergan.</p><p> “It’s a warm morning for fast driving,”</p><p>said Gaston. “Hale’s a sensible man; he </p><p>won’t kill his horses, but he’ll have the </p><p>preacher here on time.” </p><p> Lonergan nodded. The river-front as</p><p>they looked at it was deserted. Not a man </p><p>was in sight, and no noise came from the </p><p>open doors. </p><p> “Say! They’re behaving themselves</p><p>down there today, aren’t they?” said Lon- </p><p>ergan. </p><p> Gaston did not reply. His eyes suddenly</p><p>had narrowed to slits. That quiet down </p><p>there wasn’t natural. It was too good to </p><p>be true. Gaston’s quick senses had caught </p><p>the unusual silence and read it for the un- </p><p>natural calm that is prelude to a storm. </p><p> “It’s too good, Lonergan,” he began.</p><p>Then, “Hello! There they come!” </p><p> Hale’s buggy had swung out of the tim-</p><p>ber and was approaching the river-front. </p><p>The horses were trotting easily; Gaston </p><p>could make out the pale face of the minis- </p><p>ter beside Hale. They were passing the first </p><p>saloon in the row now. And then the peace </p><p>of the river-front was broken. </p><p> With one single shout, as a signal, there</p><p>sprang from each side of the street a dozen </p><p>men. They caught the horses by the head </p><p>ere Hale could reach his whip. They threw </p><p>themselves onto the buggy. </p><p> It was only a matter of seconds. Then</p><p>the frightened team was coming up the </p><p>street on the jump, Hale rolling uncon- </p><p>scious on the seat, and the men of the river- </p><p>front were rushing back into their lowest </p><p>dive, bearing the struggling figure of the </p><p>minister with them. </p><p> “God!” cried Lonergan.</p><p> Gaston uttered no sound. He threw him-</p><p>self upon the maddened horses as they came </p><p>tearing up, and with Lonergan’s help soon </p><p>had them quieted. </p><p> “Good God!” cried men as they came run-</p><p>ning up. </p><p>12 </p><p>i78 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>GASTON said not a word. He </p><p>dropped his hold on the horses the </p><p>instant other hands came to help. </p><p>He looked not at Hale, who lay senseless </p><p>with a cut on the side of his head; he paid </p><p>no attention to the crowd gathering about </p><p>him. With one tug he tore open his collar, </p><p>to give room to his swelling throat. He </p><p>was panting through his nose, his lips closed. </p><p> A double-bitted ax leaned against the</p><p>doctor’s cabin. With his berserk rage vent- </p><p>ing itself in one shrill cry, Gaston seized </p><p>the gleaming tool and seemed to fly over </p><p>the ground straight toward the door of the </p><p>dive where the minister had been captured. </p><p> “Good God! He’s going alone!” cried a</p><p>young man and, empty-handed, started af- </p><p>ter him; he was Erik, the boy who had been </p><p>beaten by the pugilist, and afterward had </p><p>worked in Gaston’s crew on the right-of- </p><p>way. </p><p> “Come back, Thorson!” cried Lonergan.</p><p> It would have been too late, even if Gas-</p><p>ton could have been halted then. </p><p> They were waiting for him down at the</p><p>river-front. The mind that had directed </p><p>this scheme had expected that Gaston would </p><p>be in the van of those to rescue the minis- </p><p>ter. </p><p>. “He’s gone!” groaned Lonergan. </p><p> Gaston was passing McCarthy’s old place.</p><p>In the doorway appeared the bull-necked </p><p>Ulnick, shot-gun in hand. He laughed as he </p><p>deliberately cocked both barrels. He had a </p><p>cigar in his mouth; his face was devilish with </p><p>triumph as he raised the gun toward his </p><p>shoulder. And the next instant he lay face </p><p>downward on his own door-step, shot </p><p>through the temples, dead. </p><p> Tom Pine had not remained in his room</p><p>in vain. He had not been able to save the </p><p>minister: that had come too quickly, too </p><p>unforeseen. But he had witnessed the as- </p><p>sault on the buggy, had seen the minister </p><p>borne away, and he knew what would fol- </p><p>low. He had seen Gaston go flying down </p><p>the street, and his rifle was cocked and</p><p>ready, covering the river-front as a deer- </p><p>hunter covers the range before him when </p><p>the game is about to jump. </p><p> Ulnick’s was the first menacing figure to</p><p>show in any doorway, and Tom Pine threw </p><p>down on him and fired with the sure, easy </p><p>aim of the old-timer. </p><p> Before Ulnick’s body had struck the</p><p>ground, Tom had jacked in a new cartridge </p><p>and fired again. A man with a revolver had </p><p>thrust his head out of the dance-hall, and </p><p>Tom’s bullet passed through his jaw and </p><p>splintered a window. </p><p> Then crack, crack, crack! The river-front</p><p>suddenly had a bath of lead. Into every </p><p>door Tom sent his bullets, the shots coming </p><p>so rapidly that it seemed that several men </p><p>must be firing. Glass flew in splinters. A </p><p>third man, sticking his head out of a door, </p><p>was down on the floor, a bullet-hole through </p><p>his cheek. The screams of the two wound- </p><p>ed men supplemented the rattle of shots </p><p>and the crash of glass. </p><p> From the dance-hall a revolver cracked.</p><p>The bullet flew past Gaston’s head. Be- </p><p>hind him Erik grunted in surprised fashion </p><p>and sank down with his hands held to his </p><p>breast. </p><p> Tom riddled the dance - hall in reply.</p><p>Shrieks and curses came forth, but no more </p><p>shots. </p><p> The river - front was a pandemonium.</p><p>Women began to leave their dives and run </p><p>for the woods. Not a man showed himself. </p><p>Suddenly the minister came rolling out of </p><p>the dive into the street, thrown out by the </p><p>terrified men who had captured him. Their </p><p>plans had gone awry; the terribly accurate </p><p>shooting of Tom Pine had tamed them; they </p><p>were eager to do anything that might stop </p><p>that devilish rain of lead. </p><p> Gaston stopped before the dance - hall.</p><p>His blood-rage had passed; he saw things </p><p>clearly. In the fight which must ensue, if </p><p>he rushed the dance-hall, the minister would </p><p>surely get hurt; possibly be killed, and the </p><p>wedding would have to be postponed. He </p><p>looked through the bullet-shattered door. </p><p>What he saw inside there caused him to </p><p>pick the minister up under one arm and</p><p>deliberately turn back. Behind him Tom’s </p><p>bullets ripped the doors of the hall to splin- </p><p>ters. </p><p> A crowd was coming to help by this time.</p><p>Men had reached Erik and were carrying </p><p>him away. </p><p> “Get back, boys!” roared Gaston. “Get</p><p>back and get ready. We’re going down </p><p>there again, but we’re going to be ready for </p><p>them when we do.” </p><p> He put the minister down and pleaded</p><p>and fought with the crowd, and turned it </p><p>back. </p><p> “Back, boys! Get to cover! We’ve got</p><p>the minister now; the wedding needn’t be </p><p>delayed. And we’ll get ’em down there </p><p>when we’re ready.” </p><p>Gaston Olaf </p><p>179 </p><p> In a few seconds he had prevailed. The</p><p>minister had been rushed into the hotel; </p><p>Erik, sorely wounded, was lying in the doc- </p><p>tor’s office; and Gaston himself had shown </p><p>an example and was safely behind cover. </p><p> Up in his room Tom Pine sighed with relief.</p><p>It was about time. He had kept the river- </p><p>front indoors, but now both rifles were empty. </p><p>CHAPTER XL </p><p>THE END OF DEVIL DAVE </p><p>npHE quiet that settled suddenly down </p><p>upon the settlement then was terri- </p><p>ble. It lay like a pall in the air, snuffing </p><p>out the life and gaiety that had prevailed a </p><p>moment before. Men moved about silent- </p><p>ly, their eyes hard. A child cried suddenly </p><p>somewhere, a door slammed; then it was </p><p>still again. </p><p> Men looked at each other and parted</p><p>without a word. They gathered their wo- </p><p>men and children from the street, from </p><p>about the hotel, the dance-floor and the </p><p>doctor’s new house, and grimly carried them </p><p>to their homes. </p><p> “Stay indoors,” they said and returned</p><p>to the crowd gathered in the shelter of the </p><p>doctor’s office. </p><p> No time this for the women to wail and</p><p>plead against rash action. It had gone be- </p><p>yond that. The women looked at their </p><p>men’s faces and cowered in their homes, </p><p>white-faced but silent. </p><p> “Men!” cried the minister, aghast.</p><p>“What is this you plan to do?” </p><p> “That’s all right, Reverend; see you la-</p><p>ter,” they said, and locked him safe out of </p><p>harm’s way in the hotel. </p><p> Behind the doctor’s office the friends of</p><p>Erik, men formerly of Crew One, who now </p><p>were in Lonergan’s employ, had armed </p><p>themselves to the last man and were insist- </p><p>ing that although Erik, on the doctor’s </p><p>word, would live, it was their blood-right </p><p>to lead the attack on the river-front. Op- </p><p>posed to them were the men of the settlement.</p><p> “It’s our town that’s been given a bad</p><p>name,” they said. “We’ve got the right to </p><p>go down there first.” </p><p> Gaston fought steadily to hold both fac-</p><p>tions back. He realized that the clash was </p><p>inevitable; but, now that his rage had vent- </p><p>ed itself, he was clear-headed and cool. If </p><p>the crowd in its present mood struck the </p><p>river-front, whose men it outnumbered, the </p><p>result must be a slaughter. Nothing could </p><p>stay Erik’s friends from taking vengeance, </p><p>and if a fight were thus started, the gang- </p><p>sters would fight back and good men surely </p><p>would be killed. As furiously as he had </p><p>rushed to the attack, Gaston now struggled </p><p>to delay the conflict until the men had </p><p>grown cooler. </p><p> “The doc’s wedding is set for twelve,” he</p><p>shouted. “Are we going to spoil that for </p><p>him? Let’s have the wedding first, then go </p><p>down and clean them up.” </p><p> A low growl greeted his words. He knew</p><p>they would not acquiesce, but it was any- </p><p>thing for a delay. </p><p> “No time for weddings,” came back the</p><p>reply. “Let’s be going.” </p><p> “No!” cried Gaston. “You’ll wait a</p><p>while. This thing has got to be done or- </p><p>derly. Do you want to give yourselves as </p><p>bad a name as those Hunyaks?” </p><p> “We want to give ourselves such a name</p><p>that no toughs will ever again try anything </p><p>like this in our town,” replied Perkins. </p><p> “Good! That’s just it. And we’re going</p><p>to do it according to law and order, not </p><p>like a lot of toughs on a spree.” </p><p> That struck home with the older men.</p><p>“That’s right,” they said. Others growl- </p><p>ed: “Spit out what you’ve got to say, and </p><p>let’s get started.” </p><p> “Lonergan,” shouted Gaston, “can that</p><p>old Polander of yours go down among those </p><p>fellows in safety?” </p><p> “Yes. Why?”</p><p> “I’m going to serve notice on every man</p><p>and woman in the river-front to clear out </p><p>within an hour.” </p><p> “Hour, -!” came an interruption.</p><p>“Ten minutes is plenty.” </p><p> “Make it five!” cried others.</p><p> He compromised with them. It was then</p><p>a quarter to twelve. </p><p> “We’ll make it half an hour,” said he,</p><p>realizing that he could hold them no longer. </p><p>“That will give ’em until a quarter-past </p><p>twelve.” </p><p> “Good enough.’’</p><p> Paper and pencil were brought, and with</p><p>a board for desk Gaston set to work to draft </p><p>his notice. After scores of suggestions from </p><p>the crowd he wrote as follows: </p><p>To ALL PEOPLE IN THE RIVER-FRONT: </p><p> This is to notify you that you have thirty min-</p><p>utes to get out of town. We are coming down to </p><p>get you at 12:1s. Leave before then, or God help </p><p>you I	Thorson,</p><p>Marshal of Havens Falls. </p><p>i8o </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “That’s the style; that’s doing it in bang-</p><p>up fashion,” was the verdict of the men </p><p>who read over his shoulder. </p><p> Lonergan’s old Polander took the note</p><p>and his directions stolidly. </p><p> “If they can’t read, translate it for them,”</p><p>said Gaston. </p><p> “Aw ri’, bahss!”</p><p> The old man sallied forth on his mission.</p><p>They watched him as he went. How would </p><p>the toughs receive the note? They saw the </p><p>old man enter Ulnick’s place, where Ul- </p><p>nick’s body had been dragged inside, the </p><p>paper held in his hand. After a few min- </p><p>utes he came out, crossed the street and en- </p><p>tered another saloon, still bearing the paper. </p><p> Not a sound came up to the watchers. As</p><p>he emerged from the second place a man </p><p>came timidly out of the dance-hall and call- </p><p>ed to the messenger in Polish. The old </p><p>man spoke rapidly, handing the man the </p><p>notice. The man tossed it into the dance- </p><p>hall and without a word, ran for the river </p><p>road. From Ulnick’s some one shouted at </p><p>the old man. He held up his hand and </p><p>came back to the doctor’s office. </p><p> “They say, can they go and you no shoot</p><p>’em, hah?” he said. </p><p> A sigh of relief escaped Gaston.</p><p> “Yes,” he said. “Tell them no one will</p><p>be hurt before a quarter-past twelve.” </p><p>“Hold on!” cried Erik’s friends. “That </p><p>don’t go with us. These guys may all duck </p><p>out. We won’t stand by and see that; we </p><p>want to play a little with the fellow who </p><p>shot Erik.” </p><p> “You bet! None of that letting ’em go.</p><p>Let’s go down and make ’em give him up </p><p>right now.” </p><p> Gaston held up his hand.</p><p> “Boys, I promise you you’ll get the man</p><p>who shot Erik.” </p><p> “He’s in that dance-hall,” they protest-</p><p>ed. “He’ll get away with the rest.” </p><p> “He’s in that dance-hall,” agreed Gas-</p><p>ton, “but he won’t get away with the rest. </p><p>I promise you that.” </p><p> “Did you see him?”</p><p> “I saw him. And if he comes out, I promise</p><p>you, I’ll be the first to go down and get him.” </p><p>“All right, Thorson. But that’s got to </p><p>be good.” </p><p> “It’ll be good,” said Gaston, and sent the</p><p>messenger on his way. </p><p> There was a short lull after the old man</p><p>had delivered his message. Then the exo- </p><p>dus began. Like rats, the denizens of the </p><p>places of vice came slinking out in the sun- </p><p>light. They hugged the walls, casting fear- </p><p>ful looks over their shoulders. They saw </p><p>Ulnick’s body lying on the saloon floor, saw </p><p>the broken windows, splintered doors, and </p><p>bullet-marks, and they ran. </p><p> The two wounded men called pleadingly</p><p>for assistance, but no one heard. Five min- </p><p>utes before the time-limit had elapsed, the </p><p>last woman to leave the dives had gone </p><p>from the river-front and was following the </p><p>long, straggling line hurrying down the </p><p>river road, the last of the forces of vileness </p><p>to leave Havens Falls. </p><p> “And the man who shot Erik wasn’t</p><p>among ’em,” said Gaston. </p><p> “You sure?” Erik’s friends were suspi-</p><p>cious. “You ain’t trying to play with us, </p><p>Thorson?” </p><p> “Sure not, boys; he’s still in the dance-</p><p>hall.” </p><p> “We’ll go and see.”</p><p> “You will,” agreed Gaston icily, “when</p><p>it’s twelve-fifteen.” </p><p> By sheer force of will he held them. They</p><p>fidgeted angrily, like dogs in the leash with </p><p>their quarry before them. The minutes </p><p>dragged painfully. Two minutes remained. </p><p>Then one minute. </p><p> “Come on,” said a youngster, “that’s</p><p>close ’nough.” </p><p> Gaston held him back.</p><p> Presently Lonergan snapped his watch</p><p>shut and nodded. </p><p> “Come along, boys,” said Gaston quietly.</p><p>They followed down the street in uncan- </p><p>ny silence, crowding closely about him as </p><p>he led the way to the dance-hall. The door </p><p>was open and they could see inside. They </p><p>first saw the man whom Tom Pine had shot </p><p>through the jaw. He was sitting on the </p><p>floor, leaning drunkenly against the wall. </p><p> Then they saw the other man. He was</p><p>lolling in a chair against the bar, grinning </p><p>in ghastly fashion at the poor fellow on the </p><p>floor. His eyes were popping from his head; </p><p>his jaw sagged weakly; his tongue hung out; </p><p>his long arms drooped down nervelessly. At </p><p>his feet a big revolver lay where it had drop- </p><p>ped from his fingers. </p><p> It was what was left of Devil Dave Taggart.</p><p>THE crowd halted at the doorway, </p><p>aghast at the demoniacal transfor- </p><p>mation before them. Gaston enter- </p><p>ed alone. Taggart neither saw nor heard; </p><p>his attention was all for the man on the floor. </p><p>Gaston Olaf </p><p>181 </p><p> “Taggart!” shouted Gaston, putting a</p><p>hand on his shoulder. </p><p> Taggart looked up slowly, no gleam of in-</p><p>telligence in his blood-shot eyes. In spite </p><p>of his enmity for the man, Gaston felt a </p><p>twinge of pity. He picked up the revolver. </p><p> “Taggart! Get up!”</p><p> With his left arm he raised him to his</p><p>feet. Taggart waved a hand at the wound- </p><p>ed man and laughed slobberingly. </p><p> “Funny face,” he whispered. “Look at’s</p><p>face.” </p><p> “Come along,” said Gaston.</p><p> With the revolver in his right hand he</p><p>led the way out. </p><p> “Boys,” he said coldly, “you can’t have</p><p>him—not now. If he’d put up a fight it </p><p>would have been different. Now I’m going </p><p>to take him down to his office and lock him </p><p>up. Out of the way!” </p><p> He went straight through them; they</p><p>stood back and let him pass without a word. </p><p>Then they followed as Gaston led his pris- </p><p>oner toward the office on the river bank. </p><p> Taggart went along in a stupor at first.</p><p>He did not recognize Gaston, did not sense </p><p>what was happening. As they approached </p><p>the river, however, his eyes seemed to clear. </p><p>At the sight of his own office he stopped </p><p>suddenly. </p><p> “Come on, Taggart,” said Gaston.</p><p> Taggart looked around wildly. He saw</p><p>the river a few steps away, saw the crowd </p><p>behind them, and lastly he saw Gaston. As </p><p>if in a flash of lightning he understood. </p><p>With a cry like a wounded animal he tore </p><p>loose. He stood up straight and stiff, him- </p><p>self for an instant, his eyes upon the man </p><p>who had tom his evil hold from Havens </p><p>Falls. </p><p> “Thorson, you -!” he screamed, and</p><p>dove forward.</p><p> His arms caught Gaston and held him</p><p>helpless. The strength of a maniac was </p><p>Taggart’s for that moment. Down in the </p><p>sawdust they fell, tightly clinched. Twice </p><p>they rolled over and over. Taggart’s mad </p><p>laugh rang loud to the heavens; and then </p><p>they rolled over again and, still locked to- </p><p>gether, dropped into the river. </p><p> The water was deep and still where they</p><p>fell in. The current closed over them and </p><p>swept on its way again, serene, undisturbed, </p><p>while the crowd lined the bank, silent, help- </p><p>less. The seconds seemed hours. Many of </p><p>them passed, and still the swift, black </p><p>waters rushed on unbroken. </p><p> Men panted open-mouthed. They groan-</p><p>ed in agony as air-bubbles broke the sur- </p><p>face. And then they shouted once, sharp- </p><p>ly. Gaston came popping out of the water </p><p>like a cork, gasped hungrily at the air, and </p><p>came swimming weakly back to shore— </p><p>alone. </p><p> A few more bubbles appeared farther</p><p>down-stream. Then the black water once </p><p>more was slipping on its way, calm and </p><p>beautiful as ever, with no hint on its sur- </p><p>face of the thing that was hidden in its </p><p>depths. </p><p> Gaston stood dripping and panting on</p><p>the river bank. He looked at the water </p><p>from which he had so narrowly escaped. </p><p>And he turned and went up the street with- </p><p>out a word. </p><p> “MEN, men!” said the minister,</p><p>rftSn when released from the hotel, </p><p>“what have you done? You bade </p><p>me to come among you to join two of your </p><p>young people in a new life, and you make </p><p>the day one of strife and bloodshed.” </p><p>Postmaster Perkins bared his silvery head </p><p>reverently. </p><p> “ ‘The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh</p><p>away; blessed be the name of the Lord!’ ” </p><p>rose his aged treble. “Reverend, what we </p><p>done had to be done. There was a jam, </p><p>and she had to be broke so decent people </p><p>could live here, and fellows like you could </p><p>come through the white water and bring </p><p>light into the wilderness. The Lord took </p><p>the bad people away. He giveth us young </p><p>people, like Ilulda Olson and Doc Sanders,</p><p>to marry and have children, and people the </p><p>land. The old order changeth, Reverend; </p><p>the wickedness has gone from Havens Falls </p><p>for good. The new order cometh, and it’s </p><p>full of hope and promise; and the Lord looks </p><p>upon His work and finds it good. Reverend, </p><p>we ain’t in no mood to hold the celebration </p><p>we planned, but in this dark moment we </p><p>need that wedding to help us look toward </p><p>the future.” </p><p> “Yes,” said Hulda, firmly. “Ve skall get</p><p>married yoost the same.” </p><p> So the doctor and Hulda were married</p><p>—with a silent crowd of witnesses where </p><p>hilarity had been planned. And after </p><p>the ceremony the minister prayed, not </p><p>only for the happiness of the newly wed- </p><p>ded couple, but for the future of the town, </p><p>that the men thereof might turn from </p><p>violence to gentleness toward all their kind, </p><p>182 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>“forgive their enemies, patiently turn the </p><p>other cheek-” </p><p> Gaston looked sharply across at Rose.</p><p>She had lifted her eyes to him in the same </p><p>moment. </p><p> “—Live their lives soberly and earnest-</p><p>ly-” </p><p> Her eyes dropped.</p><p> “—God-fearing and useful citizens, prid-</p><p>ing themselves not upon their strength-” </p><p> Rose raised her eyes to Hale’s bowed</p><p>head. </p><p> “—Amen!”</p><p>CHAPTER XLI </p><p>DAYS OF QUIET </p><p>PEACE had come at last to Havens </p><p>Falls, the deep, abiding peace of a </p><p>community solemnly consecrated to law and </p><p>order. The tragic manner of its coming had </p><p>left its mark; Havens Falls was not likely </p><p>to forget what the river-front had meant to </p><p>it; it would never again run the risk of simi- </p><p>lar conditions. Before the traces of the last </p><p>cruel struggle had been removed a solemn </p><p>mass-meeting was held before Olson’s hotel. </p><p> “It was whisky that did it, boys—whisky,</p><p>and wickedness, and hell-raising,” quavered </p><p>old Perkins. “Touch and go, it. was, boys; </p><p>and we happened to win because a man </p><p>came to town who was big enough to make </p><p>us strong. We were a helpless little hell- </p><p>hole here in the woods before he came to </p><p>town. Now we’re clean, thank God! As </p><p>clean as the timber around us. Boys, are </p><p>we going to risk getting in another gang like </p><p>what we had? Are we going to have an- </p><p>other river-front? Or are we going to have </p><p>a decent town that will grow and be a cred- </p><p>it to the men who made it?” </p><p> “A decent town—that’s the ticket!” came</p><p>the responses. “We’ve had enough of the </p><p>other thing. What do you say, Thorson?” </p><p>Gaston looked down toward the river</p><p>front. For the time being he was as seri- </p><p>ous-minded as any man in the crowd. He </p><p>saw not the glitter and excitement of the </p><p>front, but only its sordid vileness, its men- </p><p>ace to a community of homes, of families, of </p><p>women and children. </p><p> “I say,” he began slowly, and paused as</p><p>a vision grew before his eyes, “I say we </p><p>ought to burn the river-front to the ground, </p><p>and scatter the ashes, and build new build- </p><p>ings where it stands, so there’d be nothing </p><p>left to remind us of what was there or what </p><p>happened before it was cleaned up.” </p><p> They voted on it, a vote of hands, and</p><p>even the wild youngsters working for Loner- </p><p>gan voted, “ay.” So the river-front was </p><p>burned one afternoon when there was no </p><p>wind, burned until its last trace of wicked- </p><p>ness had been purged by fire; and in the </p><p>evening, before the last red coals had died </p><p>to ashes, the settlers had decided to build </p><p>their first schoolhouse where the old dance- </p><p>hall had stood, and to do it at once, so the </p><p>children would have a place ready for them </p><p>when the school season opened in the Fall. </p><p> “And now that’s done,” said Gaston.</p><p>“The river-front is gone; the town starts </p><p>new, with nothing to make trouble for it or </p><p>keep it from having clean hands. Tag- </p><p>gart’s gone; so I start fresh, too, and there’s </p><p>nothing left here to stir the hell up in me, </p><p>or get me to fighting, or keep me from liv- </p><p>ing quiet, respectable, and settled.” </p><p> Tom Pine coughed in a suspicious man-</p><p>ner. A coroner’s jury having decided that </p><p>Ulnick’s death was “an act of God,” Tom </p><p>had a rather improved opinion of himself. </p><p>He and Gaston were sitting, chair-tilted, </p><p>against the front of Dr. Sanders’s old office. </p><p>They had moved into the building imme- </p><p>diately after the doctor had vacated, Gas- </p><p>ton having declared that it was time they </p><p>began to practise living in a home of their </p><p>own. Tom Pine had acquiesced eagerly; </p><p>there was more freedom in “baching it” </p><p>than in living at the hotel. </p><p> “No-o-o,” drawled Tom, “there’s nothing</p><p>left here to stir a fellow up, that’s sure.” </p><p>“And that’s just how we want it,” said </p><p>Gaston. “Everything nice and orderly, and </p><p>nothing to keep a man from being a steady- </p><p>going citizen!”</p><p> “Except himself.”</p><p> “Eh?”</p><p> “Except himself,” repeated Tom. “If a</p><p>man ain’t made to be a steady-going citi- </p><p>zen, well, it don’t make any difference where </p><p>you set him down, Gaston Olaf, he ain’t </p><p>going to be one, that’s all. Some folks are </p><p>made to five in houses and use the same </p><p>bed all their fives; others ain’t. I won’t say </p><p>any more than that.” </p><p> “No need to say any more,” said Gaston.</p><p>“You mean that I’m one of those who’re </p><p>not made to settle down.” </p><p> Tom Pine shook his old head.</p><p> “You can’t make a canary-bird or a barn-</p><p>yard fowl out of an eagle,” said he. “There </p><p>Gaston Olaf </p><p>183 </p><p>ain’t any chance for argument about that </p><p>—that’s nature.” </p><p> Gaston chuckled.</p><p> “You’re a hard one for sure, Tom Pine.</p><p>Have you seen any canary-bird work around </p><p>this settlement?” </p><p> “Not so far. It’s been a nice, busy place</p><p>for a he-man to camp in up to now, I ad- </p><p>mit you that. But that was because Tag- </p><p>gart and the river-front were here and [it </p><p>was hell-for-leather between them and us. </p><p> “But they’re gone now, Gaston Olaf;</p><p>those days are past. This town’s pretty </p><p>near got religion, and it’s going to stay that </p><p>way. What then? Day after day the same </p><p>thing, week after week, and year after year, </p><p>with nothing happening for excitement. </p><p>Could folks like you ’n’ me stand it, Gaston?” </p><p> The picture unveiled itself swiftly to Gas-</p><p>ton. He saw the neat, proper town that </p><p>Havens Falls was destined to be—day after </p><p>day, year after year of it. He felt crowded, </p><p>confined. But there was Rose, and the </p><p>dream. </p><p> “You quit that kind of talk, Tom Pine,”</p><p>he commanded gruffly. “I don’t know </p><p>about you, but I do know that I want to </p><p>settle down.” </p><p> He went back to work for Lonergan.</p><p>That was the thing for him to do—break </p><p>himself in at steady, every-day work. </p><p> His experience in the woods, and his</p><p>natural leadership of men made him an in- </p><p>valuable aid to the railroad man. With him </p><p>at its head the clearing-crew slashed its way </p><p>through the timber in record time. </p><p> After the clearing came the grading and</p><p>filling. Day after day, week after week, </p><p>Gaston stuck to his task. The short, hot </p><p>Summer of the Northland was on, and along </p><p>the line swarms of mosquitoes, deer-flies and </p><p>“no-see-um’s” made life miserable. Men </p><p>threw down their tools and demanded their </p><p>time. Lonergan even suggested a lay-off for </p><p>a week. </p><p> “Not for a day,” said Gaston stubbornly.</p><p> He was beginning to hear the whisperings</p><p>of doubt within himself. The clear lakes, </p><p>the rivers, the untracked woods had begun </p><p>to call. The lure of strange trails and ad- </p><p>ventures new had whispered to his restless </p><p>spirit. </p><p> He put temptation away savagely. Not</p><p>a single day would he yield in the program </p><p>he had mapped out for himself. For it was </p><p>in the moments of idleness that the call </p><p>made itself heard. </p><p> “You’re getting kind of peekid-looking,</p><p>Gaston Olaf,” warned Tom Pine. </p><p> “I know it,” admitted Gaston. His shav-</p><p>ing-mirror had shown him the new lines </p><p>gathering between the eyebrows and about </p><p>the mouth. </p><p> The quiet, lazy Sundays came to be long</p><p>and tiresome. He seldom sought Rose’s </p><p>company since their conversation at the </p><p>house-building, and save for thoughts of </p><p>her, he admitted to himself, town-life was </p><p>irksome. </p><p> Hale, likewise, spent less time at the</p><p>Havens home than previously. He was not </p><p>given to intruding himself where he was not </p><p>sure that he was wanted. </p><p> The settlement developed rapidly. Tag-</p><p>gart’s property had fallen into the hands of </p><p>a far-away niece, and the lumber company, </p><p>to which she sold, promptly put the cut- </p><p>over land on the market, induced settlers </p><p>to come in, and began to assist in all ways </p><p>to build up the country. </p><p> “When the railroad gets through, this</p><p>country will crowd up right away,” mused </p><p>Gaston, as he read the signs. </p><p> He reproved himself promptly for such</p><p>thoughts. Was it not for this that he had </p><p>worked and risked his life? </p><p> The heat of the Summer passed, and the</p><p>time for the first frosts drew near. Instead </p><p>of the ring of the axes of the clearing-crew </p><p>there now rang out along the right-of-way </p><p>the clang of spiking hammers fastening the </p><p>steel rails to the new-laid ties. Instead of </p><p>teams bearing loads of ties, a small locomo-</p><p>tive came tooting slowly toward Havens </p><p>Falls, pushing before it flat-car loads of the </p><p>rails that the crews were laying. </p><p> Day by day the twin lines of steel crept</p><p>northward toward the settlement, and day </p><p>by day, as he led his crew, Gaston sensed </p><p>how completely the humdrum of civiliza- </p><p>tion would conquer the country when the </p><p>railroad began operations. The toot of the </p><p>locomotive in the timber was a warning. It </p><p>knelled the passing of adventure in that </p><p>part of the Big Woods. </p><p> Yet Gaston worked steadily. There was</p><p>a certain thrill in the building of the rail- </p><p>road, and he did not permit himself to think </p><p>of the days to come after the road was fin- </p><p>ished. </p><p> The first frosts came, touching the birch</p><p>and maple with a gentle wand, and tinting </p><p>their leaves dainty pink and yellow. The </p><p>air was like rare wine, and the woods were </p><p>184 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>clamorous with the chatter of birds congre- </p><p>gating for the long flight southward. </p><p> In the morning, while trudging to work,</p><p>Gaston paused and with his eyes followed </p><p>the flight of migrating ducks across the </p><p>trackless sky. He watched them until they </p><p>were out of sight, and he wondered what </p><p>new scenes they would view before they </p><p>sought rest at nightfall. </p><p> The whistle of the locomotive now could</p><p>be heard in the settlement. Lonergan had </p><p>added more men to the crews, and the work </p><p>was being pushed so the road would be com- </p><p>pleted before the frost settled into the </p><p>ground. Gaston did his work steadily and </p><p>well, but there was a lack of buoyancy and </p><p>enthusiasm in him. He now looked for- </p><p>ward to the end of the work with a feeling </p><p>of discomfort. </p><p> The woods were a riot of color now. Au-</p><p>tumn was in the Northland, and the gods </p><p>of the glorious Indian Summer had painted </p><p>the world with a lavish brush. Deep pur- </p><p>ple and burnt umber, blood-red and faint- </p><p>est yellow ocher, rioted together on the </p><p>landscape; and over the hills, like a deli- </p><p>cate veil, hung the Indian Summer’s faint </p><p>blue haze. </p><p> With less than a week’s work remaining</p><p>on the railroad, there came to the settle- </p><p>ment a rumor of a silver strike in the rough </p><p>barrens far to the north, across the line. </p><p>Daring, adventurous men were flocking </p><p>thither, said rumor, to pit their strength and </p><p>luck against the cruel northern Winter and </p><p>crueler men. The men working on the rail- </p><p>road leaned on their tools and wondered </p><p>what it would be like up there. Gaston </p><p>heard them and grimly ordered them back </p><p>to their tasks. </p><p> That night, however, he paced up and</p><p>down along the river until far into the morn- </p><p>ing, and his palms were raw from the pres- </p><p>sure of his finger nails. </p><p>CHAPTER XLII </p><p>“the trail, the trail!” </p><p>npHF. railroad was finished. The twin</p><p>■*- streaks of steel had reached Havens </p><p>Falls, binding it closely to the rest of the </p><p>great civilized world. </p><p> The finish came at the end of a hard</p><p>day’s work. Remained only the ceremony </p><p>of driving the last spike, which was to be </p><p>performed with due rites and celebration in </p><p>the morning, and the first train, bearing </p><p>mails, freight and passengers would come </p><p>tooting its way into the settlement. The </p><p>big job was done, and Havens Falls was full </p><p>of gaiety that night, anxious to make of the </p><p>morrow a big gala-day in its history. </p><p> Gaston was not gay. He was the last</p><p>man of the crew to leave the line. He left </p><p>reluctantly. The job was done. Havens </p><p>Falls was no longer a stray, woods-settle- </p><p>ment, but a new growing town on a rail- </p><p>road. </p><p> In the old settlement he had had his</p><p>place. He had played his part well. But </p><p>what place did he have in this town, where </p><p>people were talking of flour-mills and po- </p><p>tato-warehouses, and dreaming of paved </p><p>streets and electric-lights? </p><p> This was the question that had troubled</p><p>him for the last weeks. As the signs of the </p><p>town’s development increased, so had in- </p><p>creased Gaston’s sense of strangeness and </p><p>confinement. He felt cooped up, cramped, </p><p>and out of place. He had tried to deny it, </p><p>but now he was forced to acknowledge to </p><p>himself. He did not belong. </p><p> Stores and sidewalks, plate-glass win-</p><p>dows, regular hours, electric-lights! What </p><p>had he to do with them? He had come to </p><p>Havens Falls and had found a part waiting </p><p>for him to play. But now his part had </p><p>been played; never again would the settle- </p><p>ment have need of one of his kind; his job </p><p>was done; he was through. </p><p> With something like a sigh Gaston turned</p><p>his back on the line and came through the </p><p>cool, early darkness into Havens Falls. </p><p> The town was full of people, on hand for</p><p>the great event of the morrow. At the </p><p>hotel there was no talk save of the railroad </p><p>and what it would do for the country. </p><p> In the midst of this liveliness Gaston was</p><p>as a stranger at a feast. He retired to the </p><p>doctor’s old office and without a word Tom </p><p>Pine and he sat down on their door-stcp, </p><p>each busy with the same thought. Up </p><p>above, the white northern stars began to </p><p>gleam through the darkness. And in the </p><p>lull the cry of a lone wolf on some far-away </p><p>hill-top came floating into the town. </p><p> “I wonder,” said Tom Pine softly, “I</p><p>wonder what she’s like up there where they </p><p>say they’ve found silver?” </p><p> The words fell upon Gaston’s troubled</p><p>spirit like skilled fingers upon the strings of </p><p>a harp. Eagerly he began to talk. The lit- </p><p>tle town fell away and he saw the long, </p><p>Gaston Olaf </p><p>185 </p><p>rough trail through the great rough North, </p><p>with who could know what sort of adven- </p><p>tures at its end! </p><p> “She’s a hard piece of country up there</p><p>from all I hear,” interjected Tom Pine, “and </p><p>harder than Sam Hill to get to.” </p><p> Pooh! What was a little rough country?</p><p>Did any one expect to find metals stored up </p><p>beneath city sidewalks? The harder the </p><p>better! None but real men could win in. </p><p>All the more for the ones who were strong </p><p>enough to stand the going. </p><p> Gaston rose and stood before Tom Pine,</p><p>gesticulating vehemently. The new lines </p><p>had gone from his face; he felt as if a bur- </p><p>den had fallen from his shoulders. Then </p><p>suddenly he thought of Rose and sat down. </p><p> After a while he arose and went slowly up</p><p>toward the Havens home. He would go </p><p>and see her. He would settle it one way </p><p>or another that night. </p><p>i ROSE was working on something </p><p>a white when he found her, and </p><p>" though she hastily dropped it into </p><p>her work-basket at his coming he saw that </p><p>it was a garment so tiny that in his ignor- </p><p>ance he fancied it must be for a doll. </p><p> “What’s that?” he asked. “Making a</p><p>doll dress?” </p><p> “Yes—no,” she said, tucking her work out</p><p>of sight. “That is—Gaston, you mustn’t </p><p>be so inquisitive.” </p><p> “Wha-a-at?” Her confusion puzzled him.</p><p>She was actually blushing. “What’s there </p><p>about a doll’s dress that you’ve got to hide </p><p>it from me?” </p><p> “Nothing, absolutely nothing. What do</p><p>you care about dolls’ clothes, anyway?” </p><p>“Then why don’t you work at it? Don’t </p><p>let me interfere.” </p><p> “It isn’t polite to work when one’s en-</p><p>tertaining company,” she bantered. </p><p> “Go on and work,” he laughed. “I like</p><p>to see you sewing.”</p><p> “Sewing!” she said scornfully. “Oh, how</p><p>ignorant men are! I wasn’t sewing at all; </p><p>that’s embroidery. It will take weeks and </p><p>weeks to finish it.” </p><p> “Embroid-?”</p><p> “Gaston!” He had playfully reached for</p><p>the garment. “Gaston! Well, I never!” </p><p>He was holding the tiny thing up in his </p><p>huge, brown hands. </p><p> “Embroidery?” he repeated, looking at</p><p>her, and then he understood. </p><p> “Oh, oh,” he said slowly, and carefully</p><p>replaced the dress in the basket. “I’m a </p><p>clod - hopper. I didn’t understand; I </p><p>wouldn’t have said a word or touched </p><p>it-” </p><p> “You’re as curious as a woman,” she said,</p><p>tucking the garment out of sight. </p><p> “I apologize; you see, I didn’t know.”</p><p> “I know it.” They looked at one an-</p><p>other. </p><p> “Who’s it for?”</p><p> “Hulda, of course. Now if you say an-</p><p>other word, one single word, I’ll be real an- </p><p>gry-” </p><p> “Hulda?” he repeated. “The doc? Well,</p><p>I’ll be darned!” </p><p> “Stop it! Not another word.” Rose’s</p><p>self-possession had returned. “Tell me, who </p><p>is going to drive the last spike in the road </p><p>tomorrow? I’ve heard that the honor is to </p><p>be given you.” </p><p> He answered aimlessly. His thoughts</p><p>were not with the road. The little garment </p><p>had spoken to him of certain things, had </p><p>opened his eyes to tender responsibilities of </p><p>marriage. And at last he was quite sure of </p><p>himself—quite sure that he had no right to </p><p>try to realize his dream. For whatever hap- </p><p>pened, he must not run the risk of making </p><p>her unhappy. </p><p> “I’m going away,” he said, holding out</p><p>his hand.</p><p> “I thought so,” she said, and he was glad</p><p>she smiled. “I’ve seen it coming on you.” </p><p> They shook hands warmly.</p><p> “Are you going away for good?” she</p><p>asked. </p><p> He studied a moment before replying.</p><p>She would have Hale now, Hale, the steady </p><p>and responsible. She would be happy. </p><p> “Yes,” he said, “thank God, it is for</p><p>good!” </p><p> Outside, beneath the clear white stars, he</p><p>breathed to the bottom of his lungs. He </p><p>had done it. With a smiling face he had </p><p>done it. And though the pain in his heart </p><p>was like a sharp knife he had the peace of </p><p>mind which told him he had done what was </p><p>•—square. </p><p> Down the street he met the doctor.</p><p> “You old son-of-a-gun, you Doc!” he</p><p>chuckled and smote him boyishly on the </p><p>back. </p><p> He found Hale in his store.</p><p> “Hale,” said he sternly, “you’re a dam</p><p>fool. There’s a girl up the street waiting </p><p>for you and you stick down here and grouch </p><p>by yourself. How d’you expect to win Rose </p><p>i86 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>if you don’t go after her? I know—I know </p><p>what you’re going to say. Staying away on </p><p>my account. Well, that needn’t bother </p><p>you any more. I’m going away. Going to </p><p>stay away. And if you don’t go up there </p><p>tonight and get down to business I’ll—I’ll </p><p>change my opinion of you. Will you do it?” </p><p> “But, Thorson-”</p><p> “But nothing! Say you’ll do it.”</p><p> “I will.”</p><p> “Skookum! Shake hands.”</p><p> He went out of the store like a gust of</p><p>wind, humming. </p><p> When, he entered the doctor’s old office</p><p>some time later he bore two blanket packs, </p><p>stuffed and strapped, ready for the trail. </p><p>Tom Pine was asleep. Gaston dug out his </p><p>old woods-clothes and noiselessly made a </p><p>complete change. Arrayed as he was when </p><p>he had come to the settlement—soft rubber </p><p>shoes, buckskin trousers, muskrat cap, blue </p><p>shirt and silken sash—he sat down for a </p><p>moment at the doctor’s old table. </p><p> His light-heartedness left him. He folded</p><p>his arms on the table and laid his head upon </p><p>them. He had done what was square. But </p><p>it was hard. Oh, it was hardl </p><p>The picture of Rose as he had last seen </p><p>her, with the tiny white garment in her </p><p>hands—the picture he would carry away </p><p>with him—came before his eyes, and he </p><p>raised his head slowly. There was a strange </p><p>wistful smile upon his bronzed face. </p><p> The thoughts of little children came to</p><p>him. His great arms curved hungrily on </p><p>the table. Flesh of his flesh, bone of his </p><p>bone. Was he never to know what that </p><p>meant? The home, the wife, the children; </p><p>the trinity that makes the world. He hun- </p><p>gered for them then, with the strong man’s </p><p>hunger, which the weakling never knows. </p><p> But he knew now that these were not for</p><p>him. His was the lot of the roamer. For </p><p>him the open trail beneath untrammeled </p><p>stars, the life of abrupt change and excite-</p><p>ment, the lone but thrilling way of the bom </p><p>adventurer. </p><p> Foot-loose and free. It had to be so. It</p><p>could not be anything else. For he knew </p><p>now that no ties could hold him when the </p><p>go-gods called. </p><p> “Tom!” he called softly.</p><p> His old partner leaped up, wide awake.</p><p>Gaston was standing by the bunk-side, the </p><p>pack on his shoulders, rifle in hand, ready. </p><p> “Come on, Tom; there’s your pack. The</p><p>moon’s up; we’re going to travel.” </p><p> Up on the crest of the ridge where they</p><p>had stood when they first saw the town, </p><p>they paused and looked back. The lights </p><p>of the settlement gleamed like pin-pricks in </p><p>the darkness. One light gleamed particu- </p><p>larly bright. Gaston looked at it a long </p><p>time before turning his back. Then he </p><p>threw up his head and laughed, his right </p><p>arm pointing northward. </p><p> “The trail, Tom Pine, the trail!” he cried.</p><p>“Hit the trail!” </p><p>THE END </p><p>Author of “The Third Chance," "The Marrow-Bone,” ctc. </p><p>NUMBER of years ago, a pri- </p><p>vate soldier of a certain British </p><p>regiment, then stationed at Cal- </p><p>cutta, was sent to the Andaman </p><p>Islands—the Indian penal settlement—to </p><p>serve a life-sentence for murder. There </p><p>were extenuating circumstances, and his </p><p>name was William Driver. He believed in </p><p>no gods, though he swore by many, but he </p><p>worshiped most devoutly one girl, and he </p><p>was a very strong man. He was also a </p><p>crude person of limited education, and the </p><p>girl, Annie Hall, was the marrow-bone of </p><p>his existence. </p><p> Therefore, in a most wonderful way, she</p><p>helped him to escape from the Andamans </p><p>to the deep forests of Burma, where they </p><p>had ideas of living in a tree. My old friend, </p><p>Pickhead Cameron, who was at that time </p><p>head of the Forest Department, persuaded </p><p>them to build a hut, to which he added </p><p>comforts. He also persuaded them to be </p><p>married—by a Presbyterian missionary— </p><p>and for many years he aided them, so that </p><p>they were not discovered by that Govern- </p><p>ment which paid his somewhat large salary. </p><p> In the course of time a baby was born to</p><p>the Drivers, and the missionary baptized </p><p>the child, and Cameron was her godfather. </p><p>And the girl, living alone in those wild for- </p><p>ests with her parents, grew to be very lovely. </p><p>x </p><p> On her eighteenth birthday Cameron gave</p><p>her a pearl necklace, and the missionary </p><p>her first communion. Shortly after, Cam- </p><p>eron was called home to London, and the </p><p>missionary, his work done, was called home </p><p>also. </p><p> And Bill Driver mourned their going, for,</p><p>as he said to his girl: </p><p> “Mr. Cameron, he’s gone to London, and</p><p>I daren’t go there; and Mr. MacNeil, he’s </p><p>gone to heaven—so your mother says—and </p><p>I carn’t go there neither.” </p><p> Now, Pickhead Cameron had so arranged</p><p>matters that the Drivers saw no other hu- </p><p>mans; and Bill—who, by the way, stood </p><p>only five-feet-six and weighed nearly two </p><p>hundred in hard condition—had done his </p><p>best to show his gratitude. Cameron’s</p><p>pride was in the administration of his for- </p><p>ests, and Driver fully appreciated this, so </p><p>that he patrolled the district wherein he </p><p>abided and looked out for incipient fires </p><p>and other things. And when he wandered </p><p>in the deep green of the mighty teak </p><p>trees, he carried a rifle which had been </p><p>with him for a long time, and for which </p><p>Cameron supplied the ammunition. With </p><p>the carefully kept rifle always went the well- </p><p>polished bayonet. On the evening that Bill </p><p>and his woman Annie escaped from the An- </p><p>damans, she clubbed a Sikh guard into </p><p>87 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>insensibility—the source of the treasured </p><p>weapons. </p><p> So, MacNeil and Cameron went home,</p><p>but Driver still patrolled the district, as he </p><p>knew Cameron would have him do. What </p><p>thinking he did during his lonely walks was </p><p>of an atavistic character, and he had some </p><p>curiously anthropomorphic ideas regarding </p><p>the dead MacNeil. </p><p>THERE came an evening. The </p><p>shadows were beginning to lie softly </p><p>over the dim forest places, and Bill </p><p>Driver, hungry, sought his hut, his wife and </p><p>daughter, and also his supper. He was </p><p>about a mile from his home when his slowly </p><p>working intelligence was startled by the cry </p><p>of a woman. And the voice of that woman </p><p>was the voice of his daughter—Annie the </p><p>second. </p><p> Bill Driver hurled himself in the direc-</p><p>tion of that cry, crashing through the inter- </p><p>vening brush like a shell from a big gun. </p><p>The rifle went with him, but when he reach- </p><p>ed the small open space where his daughter </p><p>was struggling with a man, he dropped it. </p><p> The red haze in which years before he</p><p>had shot and killed, again enveloped him; </p><p>but he could not forget—he had brooded </p><p>too long over it—that the mere pulling of a </p><p>trigger had given him no physical satisfac- </p><p>tion, and had made him a convict, so that </p><p>while justified in defending his own, mem- </p><p>ory bade him use the mighty clutch of his </p><p>great hands in her defense, and, thus, sat- </p><p>isfy the innate craving of the fighting man. </p><p> Annie’s assailant saw Bill coming—he</p><p>also must have heard him—and he released </p><p>the girl and tried to escape. He might have </p><p>escaped from an angry gorilla, but not from </p><p>Bill Driver. The strength of the gorilla and </p><p>of Driver would be about equal. </p><p> In the convict’s subconscious mind arose</p><p>several of his long dead fathers—hairy peo- </p><p>ple who patronized no tailor. Bill was not </p><p>aware of their presence, but their prompt- </p><p>ing swayed him. The man who struggled </p><p>so impotently was a large man. Bill could </p><p>not see clearly, because of the red haze, but </p><p>he knew quite well that it was his business </p><p>to tear the fellow to pieces. </p><p> As a preliminary, he broke both his cap-</p><p>tive’s arms. He dropped his almost swoon- </p><p>ing victim on the ground. It would never </p><p>do to kill him right away; that would be as </p><p>unsatisfactory as the shooting referred to </p><p>had been. He must pull the fellow to pieces </p><p>slowly, yet he must keep him in such a men- </p><p>tal condition that he would be fully and </p><p>excruciatingly aware of his dismemberment. </p><p> Bill Driver, standing over a writhing hu-</p><p>man, puzzled his slow brain. Then Annie </p><p>the second reached him, threw her arms </p><p>around his neck, and brought him out of </p><p>the year 300,000 b. c. into a. d. 1912. </p><p> Bill Driver shook his bull-neck, and the</p><p>red fell away from his vision. But his </p><p>strength and vindictiveness remained. </p><p> “Go away, lass—he were trying to hurt</p><p>thee more than thou knows abart.” </p><p> “But, father?”</p><p> “I mun kill him, lass—an’ he’s going to</p><p>know I’m doing it.” </p><p> “But—don’t you see he’s a white man?”</p><p> “Don’t make no difference.”</p><p> “But, father, it does. Mr. Cameron</p><p>wouldn’t have stray white men around here </p><p>—what’s he doing here? You must find out, </p><p>and let Mr. Cameron know. He asked you </p><p>to watch out for things.” </p><p> There has been told a tale about a man</p><p>who aided a wounded lion, and thereby </p><p>earned the lion’s undying gratitude. We </p><p>have all heard of “dog-like devotion.” But </p><p>greater than either of these was Bill Driver’s </p><p>gratitude to my old friend Pickhead Cam- </p><p>eron. </p><p> He raised his writhing captive to a sit-</p><p>ting position, by gripping an ear between a </p><p>finger and thumb. </p><p> “Wot you doing in these ’ere forests?”</p><p> “I vill not tell you,” moaned the other.</p><p>“Oh—you won’t, eh? Nobody ain’t got </p><p>no right here unless Mr. Cameron says so. </p><p>And you’re some sort of a foreigner, wot </p><p>makes it worse. Wot are ye doing here?” </p><p>The captive’s arms hung helplessly, and</p><p>Driver’s method of supporting him was ago- </p><p>nizing. Nevertheless, he did not answer the </p><p>question. </p><p> “There must be something wrong,” ex-</p><p>claimed Annie the second, clasping her </p><p>hands nervously, “or he’d tell you, father. </p><p>You don’t want Mr. Cameron’s forests to </p><p>come to no harm. You must make him </p><p>tell.” </p><p> Bill Driver’s grin was not pleasing.</p><p> “He’ll tell,” he said tersely. “You bring</p><p>the rifle, lass.” </p><p> He threw his groaning captive across his</p><p>shoulder and walked toward his hut at the </p><p>regulation quickstep that had never left </p><p>him, the girl following with the precious ri- </p><p>fle. The tortured creature he carried moaned </p><p>The Receipt </p><p>189 </p><p>all the way, but Driver paid no atten- </p><p>tion to his pain, neither did he stop to rest </p><p>or shift the weight—his slow mind was busy </p><p>with vague guesses. </p><p> Adjoining his hut was a smaller one, used</p><p>as a storehouse. Into this Driver flung his </p><p>captive; then he fastened him securely and </p><p>went to join his wife and daughter, who </p><p>were eagerly discussing the affair. And the </p><p>mother was all aflame also—for had not the </p><p>thing in the outhouse tried to assault her </p><p>girl, and did it not seem that he meant evil </p><p>to the beloved forests of Pickhead Cameron? </p><p>Yet they ate their supper with thorough </p><p>British regard for the inner-man, a great </p><p>creed which the growth of the Empire en- </p><p>dorses daily. </p><p> Once Driver left the meal, to roughly gag</p><p>the man in the outhouse; for the English </p><p>like to eat in comfort, and the crying of </p><p>the wounded captive was disturbing. Then </p><p>Driver smoked a pipe and performed certain </p><p>mental processes almost analogous to think- </p><p>ing. </p><p> “He’ll tell,” he remarked as he lit a sec-</p><p>ond pipe before proceeding to the outhouse. </p><p>“Don’t heed his ’ollering—it’s Mr. Camer- </p><p>on’s business.” </p><p> Then he went to interview his captive;</p><p>and that which he did was not nice. In the </p><p>abstract it was a boy looking for the in- </p><p>ward principle of a watch; in the concrete, </p><p>a gorilla similarly interested in, say, a pig- </p><p>eon. I knew Bill Driver very well, and I </p><p>think he liked me; but I am also of a scien- </p><p>tific turn of mind, and, therefore, I tell the </p><p>facts. </p><p> When'the other showed a willingness to</p><p>speak, Bill removed the gag. </p><p> “My countrymen will come to find me,”</p><p>said the captive. </p><p> “Oh,” responded Driver, “how many are</p><p>there—fifty?” </p><p> “Two.”</p><p> Bill laughed.</p><p> “Don’t—oh, don’t!” shrieked the captive.</p><p> “Tell, then.”</p><p> “Will you let me go if I do?”</p><p> Bill Driver significantly lifted the rough</p><p>gag from the mud floor of the outhouse, and </p><p>the captive, snatching at the one chance of </p><p>freedom from further agony, spoke. </p><p> “You’ve heard of the Andaman Islands—■</p><p>prison?” </p><p> Over Driver’s face flashed the expression</p><p>of the hunted animal. The gag dropped </p><p>from his hand; he bared his teeth, and </p><p>his forehead wrinkled as he snarled — </p><p>“So—you found out—summat—and you </p><p>—come here—to, to-” </p><p> “Wait, wait!” shrieked the other. “You</p><p>don’t understand.” </p><p> “Yus, I do. And, you swine, you tried</p><p>to—to—to—my girl.” </p><p> “Listen. Oh, listen, please. Let me tell.”</p><p>“You tell me—tell me quick—where is </p><p>the other two that’s after me?” </p><p> Bill Driver pressed his heavy chin on the</p><p>other’s nose, moving it just enough. </p><p> “We’re not after you; never—heard—of</p><p>you,” moaned the captive. </p><p> Bill Driver lifted his face and stared.</p><p>“You never heard I was at the Andamans </p><p>—and got away?” he asked. </p><p> “You escaped?” gasped the captive, for-</p><p>getting his misery in astonishment. </p><p> Bill Driver was himself again.</p><p> “How do you want to die?” he asked.</p><p>“But all we want to do is to rescue a </p><p>man from the Andamans—help him get </p><p>away, like you did.” </p><p> The affair was too complicated for Bill’s</p><p>mind. He had no objection to another poor </p><p>devil escaping, but he had many objections </p><p>to his place of hiding becoming known. </p><p>Besides, the fellow had attempted to as-</p><p>sault his daughter; and what was he doing </p><p>in the forest, anyhow? </p><p> “How do you want to die?”</p><p> Inside the outhouse it was quite dark,</p><p>but neither man felt the need of any more </p><p>light. Outside, the bats flew low and the </p><p>teak trees woke to their evening whisper- </p><p>ings. </p><p> “Let me tell you—we will give you money</p><p>—we don’t care about you. Don’t you see </p><p>that if we help another man to escape we </p><p>daren’t tell about you?” </p><p> “Well?”</p><p> The prisoner gasped out his tale, which</p><p>was to the effect that a Burman—the lead- </p><p>er of a gang of highway robbers (dacoits)— </p><p>had been caught in the periodical dragnet </p><p>of the Department of Justice. As usual, he </p><p>produced a host of friends who swore that </p><p>he was an innocent man. They went on </p><p>the stand and testified that he not only ab- </p><p>horred dacoitry, but that he was of so spir- </p><p>itual a nature that he could not even wring </p><p>the neck of a chicken. Unfortunately for </p><p>the dacoit there was other evidence, and </p><p>the other evidence convinced the judge that </p><p>the Andaman Islands would make an ex- </p><p>cellent abiding place for the remainder of </p><p>190 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>that dacoit’s life. And so he sent him there. </p><p>It was the philanthropic desire of Driver’s </p><p>captive and his two countrymen to rescue </p><p>said highway robber. </p><p> “Well?” said Bill Driver when the tale</p><p>was told. </p><p> “His poor wife cries for him,” explained</p><p>the other. </p><p> But Bill came of a nation of shopkeepers.</p><p> “ ’Ow much are you getting for doing it?”</p><p>he asked. </p><p> The other hesitated.</p><p> “How do you want to die?” said Driver.</p><p> “There are mines.”</p><p> “Yus?”</p><p> “Ruby mines that we made quite sure the</p><p>man at the Andamans knows about—oh, </p><p>we are very sure. Ve vill get him away, and </p><p>for doing so get the place of the mines.” </p><p>“Well?” </p><p> “If you will let me go, I will—give you</p><p>half my share.” </p><p> “How did you get into these ’ere for-</p><p>ests?” </p><p> “I was lost,” replied the other with ap-</p><p>parent truthfulness. “My friends are at— </p><p>a fishing village.” </p><p> Bill saw his daughter struggling in his</p><p>captive’s arms. The captive could not see </p><p>Bill’s face. </p><p> “I ain’t got nothing against you ’elping a</p><p>poor devil escape, but—how are you going </p><p>to do it?” </p><p> “It’s all arranged,” said the other eager-</p><p>ly. “In native sailboats we go—with ma- </p><p>chine guns that came as sewing-machines. </p><p>We will have thirty Burmans with us, just </p><p>for the hard work, because with our ma- </p><p>chine guns we could do it alone. The con- </p><p>vict station has no cable or anything, and</p><p>the guard-ship—pooh! Just a few colas he </p><p>sailors with old niles and ten rounds of am- </p><p>munition, and English officers with swords. </p><p>We take our sail-ships, and nobody sus- </p><p>pects. The soldiers—about hundred and </p><p>fifty—have also just a few rounds of car- </p><p>tridges. It is easy.” </p><p> “Well?”</p><p> “We go close to guard-ship—little steam-</p><p>er, you know. We go close like poor sail- </p><p>ship in distress, asking for water. Guard- </p><p>ship we easy find, but if in harbor just the </p><p>same. Then we kill all on guard-ship, easy, </p><p>and-” </p><p> “Well?”</p><p> During his short acquaintance with Wil-</p><p>liam Driver the captive had found little </p><p>cause for amusement. Now he laughed un- </p><p>pleasantly:	V</p><p>“Then we free all the convicts—fifteen </p><p>thousand black men. The convicts very </p><p>glad to kill guards and soldiers. We help </p><p>with our machine guns. Then, while the </p><p>convicts are having little fun, we take our </p><p>man away, and nobody ever know about </p><p>us. Afterward, convicts blamed—mutiny. </p><p>Who will believe tale about white men com- </p><p>ing and freeing them? We only take our </p><p>man—no more. Lots will be killed. So, we </p><p>free all convicts to get them blamed, and </p><p>to keep soldiers busy while we take our man </p><p>away. But we leave convicts having their </p><p>little fun, so we get away without being </p><p>bothered by many wanting to go with us.” </p><p>“Fun?” asked William Driver. </p><p> “Yes—we tell convicts about English wo-</p><p>men, you know.” </p><p> Bill Driver’s powerful body twitchcd</p><p>strangely. About his lips was a slight froth. </p><p> “Yes,” added the prisoner. “English wo-</p><p>men—wives—girls—fifteen thousand black </p><p>murderers—very few soldiers—very little </p><p>ammunition.” </p><p> A wounded gorilla will first scream, then</p><p>mutter automatically and continue to mut- </p><p>ter. Bill did not scream, but he had no con- </p><p>trol of his words. </p><p> “Near twenty years ago I told Annie I</p><p>loved her. Then I read a book about what </p><p>the blacks did to the English women in the </p><p>Mutiny, Cawnpore and the like. And I </p><p>were scared that some black might do it to </p><p>my Annie, and so I shot the first black I </p><p>saw. It were foolish of me, because the </p><p>blacks in India are now all decent folks, ex- </p><p>cept those they send to the Andaman Is- </p><p>lands. They sent me to the Andamans for </p><p>shooting the black, and I deserved it. Annie </p><p>helped me escape. I read it in a book. </p><p>Read just what them blacks will do when </p><p>your friends lets them loose. You won’t be </p><p>there. And—my daughter.” </p><p> I do not know what Bill Driver did with</p><p>his captive. </p><p> I know that he went to his hut obsessed</p><p>with the importance of a mission; that in </p><p>spite of the pleadings of the women who </p><p>loved him, he gave certain orders and made </p><p>known his intention. </p><p> The wife and daughter were to do their</p><p>best to get to Moulmein, where there was a </p><p>telegraph. If they got there, they were to </p><p>see to it that the authorities sent a man-of- </p><p>war to the Andamans. As Bill put it: </p><p>The Receipt </p><p>191 </p><p> “It will take maybe a week to get there.</p><p>If I went, they’d want to know all about </p><p>me, and they’d put me in jail. Then they’d </p><p>take a month to investigate—and think wot </p><p>them black convicts could do in a month. </p><p>Now, you go to Moulmein, and use Mr. </p><p>Cameron’s name, and get a telegram to him. </p><p>But be careful not to say a word abart what </p><p>he done for us. Do all you can to make </p><p>’em send a man-of-war. I’m going to the </p><p>Andamans to warn ’em—if I get there in </p><p>time.” </p><p> “But—” from Annie the first.</p><p> “No buts, lass. There ain’t no need to</p><p>tell who I am, though I’d go anyhow. You </p><p>start for Moulmein.” </p><p> So they parted at the little hut, in the</p><p>midst of a circle of great teak trees, where </p><p>years before they had had notions of mak- </p><p>ing their home in one of them, where Pick- </p><p>head Cameron had found them, and where </p><p>MacNeil had married them. </p><p>BILL DRIVER, taking with him </p><p>some few stores and the precious </p><p>rifle and bayonet, made a forced </p><p>march of twenty-six hours to the coast and </p><p>when he left the jungle at a tiny fishing </p><p>village, the haunting smell of the clear sea </p><p>brought memories of the fog-bound spirit of </p><p>England, and of the warmer wraith forbid- </p><p>ding escape from the Andaman Islands. </p><p>The tremulous stimulant of sentiment shiv- </p><p>ered his spine with recollection, and he </p><p>clutched his rifle the more tightly as he cir- </p><p>cled the huts of the fishermen. </p><p> Quietly he laid his small stock of food and</p><p>water in the stern of a boat, cut the grass-rope </p><p>hawser and got aboard. There was a slight </p><p>creaking when he hoisted the single sail, but </p><p>the fishermen were asleep and the light </p><p>breeze was off the land. And Bill Driver </p><p>steered in the general direction of east and </p><p>south, down a wavering lane of moonlight </p><p>that seemed to beckon him along his not- </p><p>too-accurate course. </p><p> It is necessary to guess at the details of</p><p>that voyage. Nearly twenty years before </p><p>he had crossed that same part of the Indian </p><p>Ocean, in the scow known at the Andamans</p><p>as the “milk-boat,” with the woman who </p><p>had shown him the way of escape—and a </p><p>terrible voyage it had been. For it had </p><p>only been by favor of the god of the chances </p><p>that they had made the coast of Burma, de- </p><p>spite their own heroic efforts. And what I </p><p>once told about it came from Annie, in the </p><p>main, for, as has also been told, Bill was no </p><p>teller of tales. </p><p> So, regarding the voyage when he went</p><p>back, only guesses can be made, since he </p><p>went alone. Besides, there is another rea- </p><p>son. But I am inclined to think, because I </p><p>have been a sailor all my life and know how </p><p>limited was Bill’s knowledge of the craft—I, </p><p>indeed, state without fear of contradiction, </p><p>that the imperious, though ever-bibulous, </p><p>god of the chances again aided the man; and </p><p>that, furthermore, that same decadent deity </p><p>prevailed upon his brother tippler who rules </p><p>so laxily over the minor winds. For Bill </p><p>Driver, by simply keeping his frail boat be- </p><p>fore it, made the harbor of Port Blair on </p><p>the morning of the seventh day. And dur- </p><p>ing the passage he saw no other ship. </p><p> The early morning mists were wreathing</p><p>into fantasies as Bill rounded the point. </p><p>These lifted suddenly, and the penal settle- </p><p>ment thrust itself into his vision, but there </p><p>was nothing unpleasing about its appear- </p><p>ance. The man stared at the place, and the </p><p>place seemed to stare back at the man, and </p><p>the man felt a sense of friendliness. It was </p><p>as if he had met an old enemy, with whom </p><p>he had once fought a hard battle, but with </p><p>whom he now clasped hands. </p><p> And it was all the same—Hope Island,</p><p>where he had lived in his lonely hut; the </p><p>settlement of Port Blair, with the men’s </p><p>barrack-like jail on that island, divided by </p><p>a strip of water from the women’s jail; the </p><p>hilly island where the paroled convicts start- </p><p>ed independent life again, and, up the es- </p><p>tuary, Viper, where the worst characters </p><p>were confined. </p><p> The harbor was empty, neither the guard-</p><p>boat nor the convict-carrying ship being </p><p>there. </p><p> The breeze died, and Bill lowered the</p><p>sail, and, with great effort got out the clum- </p><p>sy oars. Dizzily he looked toward the bun- </p><p>galows of the officers, then he began to</p><p>row toward the chief commissioner’s pri- </p><p>vate wharf. When a convict it had been </p><p>his business to row the milk boat from is- </p><p>land to island, and the chief commissioner’s </p><p>wharf had been his first place of call. </p><p> The heavy oars seemed to have wills of</p><p>their own, and Bill could hardly control </p><p>them. On the wharf a tall sikh guard </p><p>roused from his dozing and watched him </p><p>come. </p><p> Bill Driver made the boat fast to the</p><p>worn cleet on the steps of the landing. He </p><p>192 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>clawed out of her like a man trying to scale </p><p>a cliff, and made his way feebly up the </p><p>steps on hands and knees. Half-way up he </p><p>paused and laughed vacantly, for he had </p><p>discovered that he had reached the right </p><p>place and that his fearful voyage was over. </p><p>It also occurred to him that he had eaten </p><p>and drank but little, and that he had not </p><p>slept at all. </p><p> “Abbe kitha jarlka?”</p><p> Bill, at the head of the steps, looked up</p><p>to the voice. It was a long time since he </p><p>had heard Hindustanee spoken. Some one </p><p>wanted to know where he was going. Bill’s </p><p>soul tried to tell the voice that it was none </p><p>of that voice’s - business, but his lips </p><p>were working like an infant’s at breast- </p><p>time, and the words he tried to get between </p><p>them trailed off into curious little noises </p><p>which mocked him. </p><p> Then he forgot where he was going, and,</p><p>struggling to remember, memory asserted </p><p>itself over the vague impressions of the </p><p>present. And memory told Bill that he </p><p>was again a convict confined, and that he </p><p>had grown tired of the loneliness, and that </p><p>he was going to kill the Sikh guard on the </p><p>chief commissioner’s wharf, so that he </p><p>would be hanged and suffer no more. </p><p> He lay down on the rough planking and</p><p>wandered in the past. </p><p> His mind swirled to the boat he had just</p><p>left. There were two boats. No—one boat. </p><p>He had taken that boat from a Burman fish- </p><p>ing village, and he had grinned at the moon </p><p>when he took it. From just behind that </p><p>moon the voice again spoke to him. </p><p> “Who are you?” it said in English.</p><p> And Bill Driver opened his eyes and</p><p>looked up at the tall Sikh guard. Then he </p><p>clutched feebly at his precious rifle. The </p><p>Sikh had grown gray in service, and Bill </p><p>had changed also, but the men knew one </p><p>another at once. </p><p> “Toom kady.”</p><p> “Yus,” muttered Bill, “it’s me. This ’ere</p><p>was once your rifle—my girl hit yer, and </p><p>took it. I ain’t come to kill yer this time. </p><p>Did yer know that one morning I were </p><p>going to throttle you? I went behind that </p><p>there hedge, and I trod on some English </p><p>flowers wot were growing there, and the </p><p>smell of them made me weepy. My girl— </p><p>wot had come here as a maid to the chief </p><p>commissioner’s sister — found me there </p><p>blubbing. So, I didn’t throttle yer.” </p><p> The Sikh’s rifle had followed every move-</p><p>ment of William Driver. Indeed, I think </p><p>that it was only the uncanniness of his ar- </p><p>rival that saved him. The Sikh was super- </p><p>stitious, and Bill had not only reappeared </p><p>to him out of the morning mists, but it was </p><p>as if the rugged personality of the famous </p><p>convict had suddenly and fearsomely thrust </p><p>itself forth from the fathered years. Be- </p><p>sides, he was supposed to be dead. Any </p><p>other man would have been dead. </p><p> But when the guard felt quite sure that</p><p>his old enemy was not dead, he grinned re- </p><p>lievedly behind his great beard. Then he </p><p>stepped forward and removed the precious </p><p>rifle from the unresisting fingers. Then he </p><p>fired his own rifle into the air and alarmed </p><p>the colony. </p><p> And Bill Driver, unable to stand, but</p><p>again conscious, glared up at the Sikh, look- </p><p>ing for trouble and cursing his inability to </p><p>cause it. The chief commissioner’s bun- </p><p>galow was only about a hundred feet from </p><p>the wharf, a carefully cultivated flower gar- </p><p>den separating. Consequently Sir George </p><p>Furlong was the first man to reach the place </p><p>of alarm. </p><p> “Bot budmash waller hi, Burra Sahib,” ex-</p><p>plained the Sikh. </p><p> But the guard’s explanation was not suf-</p><p>ficiently particular. The chief commis- </p><p>sioner only saw an exhausted white man </p><p>stretched out on his private wharf—a white </p><p>man who was apparently a stranger to the </p><p>islands. </p><p> “Who is he—what do you mean?”</p><p> Bill was so weak that when he looked at</p><p>things they appeared to be separated from</p><p>him by a glass globe full of water. The man </p><p>talking to the Sikh was not the old chief </p><p>commissioner of his time of captivity, and </p><p>he loomed above him like an attenuated </p><p>ghost. Perhaps Bill guessed at his identity. </p><p>By forcing all his will into his mighty mus- </p><p>cles he managed to raise his hand and sa- </p><p>lute. </p><p> “I’m Bill Driver, sir,” he said, “wot—</p><p>got away—from here.” </p><p> Then he fainted again, as the wharf be-</p><p>came crowded with half-dressed officers and </p><p>men. The doctor knelt by Driver’s side. </p><p> “Get some brandy. No, he’s pretty well</p><p>worn out—a hypo’s better.” </p><p> The sun flooded the harbor, and Port</p><p>Blair glittered like a diamond. Two sol- </p><p>diers supported Bill whilst the contents of </p><p>the hypodermic syringe warmed life into </p><p>him, and the men and women on the chief </p><p>The Receipt </p><p>193 </p><p>commissioner’s wharf watched in a tense si- </p><p>lence, plaided with the colors of speculation </p><p>and memory. </p><p> And this was Bill Driver, the famous con-</p><p>vict. The only man who had ever escaped </p><p>from the Andamans, and—a man whom a </p><p>woman had really loved. Wonderful Wil- </p><p>liam Driver! What was it you had that </p><p>made your Annie love you? It wasn’t only </p><p>your strength. Other men might equal that. </p><p>I almost can myself. You who so seldom </p><p>spoke, and never heard of verses—what was </p><p>there in you, William Driver? Why should </p><p>the tender Fate who tries to arrange the </p><p>love-affairs of men have made a special ef- </p><p>fort on your behalf? For—a woman loved </p><p>you for yourself alone! Then how had he </p><p>come back to the penal settlement—where </p><p>had he been all the years—and for what </p><p>reason had he returned? </p><p>“I read it in a book,” muttered Bill. </p><p>“Yes, yes, we know,” said the doctor </p><p>soothingly. “But that was very long ago.” </p><p>“Abart a week—a long week,” muttered </p><p>Bill. </p><p> The doctor studied him.</p><p> “No fever. Why is he delirious?”</p><p>The chief commissioner interrupted— </p><p>“Driver, why have you come back?” </p><p> The sunlight hurt Bill’s sleep-craving eyes</p><p>and made him angry. </p><p>“Some grub and a sleep, and I’ll help ye.” </p><p>“Yes, yes—you came to help us?” </p><p>“Swine,” muttered Bill. “There was two </p><p>swine—no, three at the start—there’s only </p><p>two now. I came to tell you—and I’ll help </p><p>you.” </p><p> “Yes, Driver—go on.”</p><p> “Swine,” replied Bill.</p><p> “Can’t you help him, doctor—give him</p><p>something?” </p><p> “He’ll be all right, sir, after we get food</p><p>into him and let him sleep.” </p><p> “But, you don’t think he came back here</p><p>for the fun of it, do you. Give him some- </p><p>thing.” </p><p> The doctor obeyed reluctantly.</p><p> “Read it in a book, about swine,” whis-</p><p>pered Bill. “And the swine is coming here.” </p><p>“Yes, Driver—go on.” </p><p> “Wot’s—the—name of—guard-boat?”</p><p> “The Mayo.”</p><p> “Swine—got her—killed all—crew.”</p><p> “What?”</p><p> “Don’t bother — abart convicts. Look</p><p>out—for women. Worse than Cawnpore— </p><p>coming.”	*</p><p>13 </p><p> Along the morning breeze came the un-</p><p>mistakable rattle of a machine gun, punc- </p><p>tuated by some rifle-shots. </p><p> “Wot did—I tell yer,” muttered Bill.</p><p>“Now—look out. They got the guard- </p><p>ship.” </p><p> “I don’t quite understand,” said the chief</p><p>commissioner. “Tell me, Driver.” </p><p> “Forrin swine—going to loose convicts—</p><p>tell ’em abart white women, he said—just </p><p>like in book I read—abart mutiny—ma- </p><p>chine guns.” </p><p> “God! Why doesn’t the Government</p><p>give us a cable?” </p><p> Bill blinked up at the chief commissioner</p><p>and spoke confidentially, also confidently. </p><p> “Just hold on, sir. It’s all right—just</p><p>hold on, and my Annie will bring a man-o’- </p><p>war.” </p><p> Shortly afterward, Bill Driver came as</p><p>near blushing as he ever did in all his tur- </p><p>bulent life, for two very aristocratic ladies </p><p>were feeding him beef tea with silver spoons. </p><p> They fed him, and two Tommies put him</p><p>to bed. He insisted that the precious, if </p><p>somewhat archaic, rifle should be laid by his </p><p>side. </p><p> “When the trouble starts,” he explained,</p><p>“I want the old girl handy.” </p><p> He slept for several hours, and woke to</p><p>all his strength again, licking his Ups at the </p><p>appetizing fight before him—a fight that </p><p>had commenced shortly after he had warned </p><p>the garrison, which had, however, been able </p><p>to build a fairly. strong protection of sand- </p><p>bags, wherein the women were now doing </p><p>their best to soothe the pain of many wound- </p><p>ed men, for the smaU stock of anesthetics </p><p>and anodynes had been exhausted.	1</p><p> It was nearing sunset, and all the won-</p><p>der-colors of the Indian Ocean appeared to </p><p>be playing with the fish jumping in the </p><p>harbor. There was a lull in the fighting, </p><p>for the convicts were busy with their eve- </p><p>ning curry and rice. Also, the more subtle </p><p>were holding conferences. The first aban- </p><p>don of freedom had worn itself out, and </p><p>some were beginning to see a rift in the </p><p>altruism of the two foreigners who had freed </p><p>them. The fingers of many dead pointed </p><p>to an unpleasing end. </p><p> An ancient murderer nibbled at a piece</p><p>of dried fish, and spoke between nibbles. </p><p> “They came,” he said, “and they cap-</p><p>tured the Ag boat, on which they put their </p><p>many-mouthed guns. They sailed close to </p><p>where the British have made them a fort, </p><p>194 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>and, the water being shallow, they ground- </p><p>ed. With much effort they got off. Mean- </p><p>while, their men let us go free—telling us to </p><p>seek revenge and the white women. Now, </p><p>my brothers, what is the reason of this do- </p><p>ing? In what way are these two white men, </p><p>who are not English, interested in our en- </p><p>joyments. Many of us are dead, and the </p><p>English still hold the fort.” </p><p> “It is said that they hate the English be-</p><p>cause they are white, yet are not English— </p><p>being of a lower caste,” suggested another. </p><p> “And that there is a great war coming,</p><p>after which there will be no more English; </p><p>at which time all men will be free,” said a </p><p>third. </p><p> “Free,” sneered the ancient. “Who is</p><p>free? What is free? Even a rajah is not </p><p>free. By his women is he enslaved as are </p><p>others by opium. When this matter of kill- </p><p>ing the English in this place is concluded, </p><p>what then? Suppose it is but the revenge </p><p>of the two white men who are not English. </p><p>Well, we will have helped at that revenge, </p><p>and had our fill of women’s screams. Then </p><p>will the two white men want to take the </p><p>Mayo Ag boat and go back to their place </p><p>—which will show us their wisdom. My </p><p>brothers—” he leaned forward in the little </p><p>circle—“we, who are wise men, and friends, </p><p>must see to it that we, also, go from here in </p><p>that Mayo Ag boat. I have a memory that </p><p>the British Government has a long arm.” </p><p>“It might have been wise,” said another </p><p>thoughtfully, “had we gone to the side of </p><p>the British. They have a lion for their </p><p>caste-mark, and ever do many seek to kill </p><p>that lion. He is a sleepy lion and wakes </p><p>but slowly. But when he does wake he </p><p>makes the jungle tremble with his rage, and </p><p>all the lesser beasts hide from him. Did </p><p>not my father tell me-” </p><p> And so on. There was infinite chatter-</p><p>ing. Relatives and old cronies in crime </p><p>jubilated over the cooking-pots. The wo- </p><p>men prisoners had their peculiar place in </p><p>the orgy. The dark closed over a chorus of </p><p>nasty noises. The few little circles of old </p><p>men gabbled wisely, but the mass was a </p><p>thoughtless horde craving many things.</p><p>BILL DRIVER, rubbing his eyes </p><p>with one great hand and trailing the </p><p>precious rifle with the other, had </p><p>reported himself to the captain in command </p><p>of the white soldiers. And that officer had </p><p>said things to William which made him feel </p><p>lumpy inside, made him feel that he could </p><p>just about lick a hundred of the enemy. </p><p>Very much embarrassed, he tried to explain </p><p>this feeling. </p><p> “I’m only a third-class shot,” he stam-</p><p>mered, “but I’m useful with the butt and </p><p>baynit.” </p><p> And over it all hung the peculiarly peace-</p><p>ful smell of the wood fires. The bats flew </p><p>low. In the creeks and estuaries the mist- </p><p>wraiths began to form. </p><p> But there was a hideous unanimity about</p><p>the killing of the garrison, which was fos- </p><p>tered exceedingly when some genius of a </p><p>convict found the commisariat sergeant’s </p><p>store of wines and spirits. There are cer- </p><p>tain castes in India that profess to abhor </p><p>drink, but religion is at times elastic. </p><p> The machine guns spluttered. The de-</p><p>fenders fired at the advancing menace, but </p><p>the terrain favored the convicts with every </p><p>sort of cover, and they were able to creep </p><p>almost up to the defenses before attacking </p><p>with their axes, adzes and weapons looted </p><p>from the Mayo. It must be remembered </p><p>that there were about fourteen thousand </p><p>convicts, and that the two machine guns </p><p>effectually prevented any sortie of the gar- </p><p>rison which was so very short of ammuni- </p><p>tion. </p><p> And the whole affair had been so unex-</p><p>pected, so unprepared for. Many of the </p><p>defenders felt that they were in a hideous </p><p>nightmare, out of which they would wake </p><p>in due time; and in that belief many died. </p><p>Description of it all is as impossible as would </p><p>be the description of a burning building. It </p><p>was fight, fight, fight. </p><p> The drink worked in the convicts and the</p><p>moon set. Then they began firing the </p><p>houses, making a glimpse of an indecent </p><p>hell as they ran about with torches. And </p><p>ever the ammunition in the little fort dwin- </p><p>dled. Thus, with all Port Blair ablaze, the</p><p>last round was served out, and the men were </p><p>told of this fact. Some grinned, some swore, </p><p>some said nothing, each after his fashion; </p><p>but all grimly held on. </p><p> Shortly before daylight an order was</p><p>whispered to certain men. It had to do </p><p>with the use of the shells in some revolvers. </p><p>These were on no account to be fired at the </p><p>enemy. </p><p> The dark lifted to the kiss of the dawn.</p><p>The breath of morning moved over the har- </p><p>bor. The ammunition of the defenders was </p><p>exhausted. The convicts came on, careless </p><p>The Receipt </p><p>195 </p><p>of creed distinction, howling in a reeling </p><p>frenzy—Hindoos, Mohammedans, every </p><p>caste known to India and Burma. The set- </p><p>tlement echoed to their yells as they swirled </p><p>forward. </p><p> Then humanity clashed at the breast-</p><p>works, and voices melted into a sort of hum, </p><p>splashed with curses and weapons meeting. </p><p> Oaths from every one of that little group</p><p>of islands in the grim North Sea mingled </p><p>with the fighting gutturals of the valiant </p><p>Sikh guards, dying for the honor of the salt </p><p>they had eaten. And B il 1 D river and his old- </p><p>time enemy of the chief commissioner’s </p><p>wharf found themselves side by side. They </p><p>grinned at each other through sweat-clut- </p><p>tered faces and parried and thrust in a glor- </p><p>ious spirit of comradeship. Yet the drunk- </p><p>en degenerates prevailed. The defenders </p><p>did not give way—they fought till they fell </p><p>and died. </p><p> Over the souls of certain men who had</p><p>been told off to do a certain clean deed with </p><p>the few remaining shells in the revolvers </p><p>spread a horror of that duty. These looked </p><p>furtively at the women. </p><p> The sun rose over burning, blackened Port</p><p>Blair and flushed at the screaming filth it </p><p>lighted. Certain men agreed that the gar- </p><p>rison could not last five minutes longer. </p><p>These looked at each other; then they did </p><p>not look at each other. They staggered to- </p><p>ward the group of women and girls. </p><p>Then- </p><p> She came round the point—a gray, lithe</p><p>shape, cleared for action, her ensign snap- </p><p>ping angrily. And as she came her guns </p><p>smashed at the scum that had almost surged </p><p>to its desire. Her boats dropped from the </p><p>davits, and, loaded with armed marines, </p><p>drove at the beach. The women had not </p><p>been cheaply protected. </p><p>IN WAYS beyond my understand- </p><p>ing, the pleading of Annie the first </p><p>had prevailed against the precedent </p><p>of regulation, and the captain of the cruiser </p><p>had brought her, and Annie the second with </p><p>her. That she was liable to imprisonment </p><p>for conniving at her man’s escape was a</p><p>detail she ignored entirely. </p><p> She was the marrow-bone of Bill Driver’s</p><p>life, and, therefore, she knew that her place </p><p>was by his side. And, searching frantically </p><p>among the wounded and dead, she found </p><p>him lying unconscious, across the body of </p><p>the Sikh guard, among the carefully culti- </p><p>vated English flowers in the chief commis- </p><p>sioner’s garden. And while Annie the sec- </p><p>ond ran for the doctor—over-busy with </p><p>other wounded men — the marrow-bone </p><p>took Bill’s head on her lap and petted him </p><p>back to consciousness. </p><p> Amid her kisses, he indicated the dead</p><p>Sikh. </p><p> “He were a man, lass,” he muttered.</p><p>“I’m most sorry you hit him when we got </p><p>away from ’ere—though we did need the </p><p>rifle mortal bad.” </p><p> Then the doctor came; and after a little</p><p>while that doctor nodded slowly. And </p><p>Annie the first, dry-eyed and beyond sobs, </p><p>knew the meaning of it. The chaplain be- </p><p>gan the prayer he had so often used, but </p><p>Bill interrupted. He could not see very </p><p>clearly, but the haze clouding him was very </p><p>different from the red haze of his passions. </p><p> “ ’Scuse me, sir,” he said weakly. “The</p><p>doc says I’m dying?” </p><p> “Yes, my man,” said the doctor.</p><p> The chaplain began to pray again.</p><p> “I want to speak to the chief commis-</p><p>sioner,” said Bill Driver. </p><p> The chief commissioner, his left arm in a</p><p>sling and his head bandaged, leaned over </p><p>Annie’s shoulder. </p><p> “Yes, Driver—what is it?”</p><p> With a vast effort Bill saluted.</p><p> “You know abart me, sir—escaped con-</p><p>vict?” </p><p> “Yes, my man, but that’s all right. You</p><p>have wiped the slate clean.” </p><p> Bill smiled weirdly.</p><p> “Thank you, sir. There’s a gent in Lon-</p><p>don—Annie can tell him. But there’s a </p><p>Mister MacNeil—he’s dead—he were a </p><p>good man, and a minister.” Bill gulped </p><p>for breath. “I—I—I want him to know </p><p>that I’ve paid the Government back.” </p><p> “He knows now,” said the chaplain.</p><p>“Yes, sir—I don’t think you’d tell a lie. </p><p>And Mr. MacNeil, he said the same thing. </p><p>But—I don’t know for myself. There may </p><p>be a heaven, and all that. I’m going to </p><p>find out in a few minutes.” </p><p> “It’s true,” said the chaplain.</p><p> “Yes, sir—but I want Mr. MacNeil to</p><p>know that I’ve paid the Government.” </p><p> “He knows now,” reiterated the chap-</p><p>lain. </p><p> Bill was silent. His brain had become</p><p>strangely clear, and he was thinking as he </p><p>had never thought before. Then- </p><p> “If I see Mr. MacNeil I can tell him,”</p><p>196 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>he said. “But that’s only telling. S’pose </p><p>he says ‘Yes, Driver.’ I won’t know but </p><p>what he’s saying it to make me feel good. </p><p>I won’t be able to prove it.” </p><p> He became silent again. The noise of</p><p>the convicts being subdued came faintly to </p><p>his ears. He saw his wife, his daughter, the </p><p>doctor, the chaplain, and the chief commis- </p><p>sioner, vaguely. </p><p> “What is it they give a feller when he</p><p>pays a debt?” he asked suddenly. </p><p>His audience failed to understand him. </p><p>“You know, sir,” he said directly to the </p><p>chief commissioner. “Suppose you pays a </p><p>bill; what is it the man gives you—the man </p><p>you pays it to?” </p><p> “Oh—a receipt,” said the chief commis-</p><p>sioner. </p><p> Bill smiled happily.</p><p> “That’s it. Please give me a receipt, sir,</p><p>so I can show it. to Mr. MacNeil, and he’ll </p><p>know I’ve paid the Government.” </p><p> The chief commissioner answered huskily:</p><p> “Very well, Driver.”</p><p> He wrote on a page torn from his note-</p><p>book; signed the writing and gave it to </p><p>Annie the first. </p><p> “Read it, lass,” whispered Bill.</p><p> And Annie read:</p><p> This is to certify that William Driver, who es-</p><p>caped from the Andaman Islands after being sen- </p><p>tenced for life thereto, returned of his own volition </p><p>to those islands to warn the officials of an impend- </p><p>ing massacre; that, due to the effort of his warning, </p><p>not a woman or child was killed or injured; that he </p><p>fought most nobly in defense of the right; that he </p><p>gave his life in that defense. </p><p> And, by virtue of the authority invested in me</p><p>as Governor of the Andaman Islands, I, George </p><p>Furlong, do hereby release the said William Driver </p><p>from the custody of the British Government—which </p><p>Government has received full satisfaction for the </p><p>debt William Driver once incurred.</p><p>George Furlong. </p><p> Bill’s vast chest heaved with the pride of</p><p>a work well done. </p><p> “Put it in my hand, lass,” he whispered,</p><p>“so I can take it with me, and show it to </p><p>Mr. MacNeil.” </p><p>AD REGAN stood with his hand </p><p>on the wooden gate-latch and </p><p>called a parting message to the </p><p>motherly figure on the porch. </p><p>“Mebby today, mother, we’ll get word.” </p><p>“Yes, Jim,” answered the other sadly. </p><p>“It’s been time. You be careful, Jim.” </p><p>Dad Regan nodded assent and, opening </p><p>the gate, started down the hill to the rail- </p><p>road station. A year had passed now since </p><p>the brief message had come telling of the </p><p>death of their son in the Navy. It had </p><p>Hereditary Evidence </p><p>197 </p><p>become a habit with the Regans to start every </p><p>day with the hope that additional details </p><p>would come, but despite their earnest old- </p><p>fashioned letters, and all the inquiries they </p><p>knew how to make, they received no news. </p><p>THE branch line that curved out </p><p>into the coal district at Stanton, and </p><p>struck the main overland track at </p><p>Pennington, was barely fifty miles long. It </p><p>boasted only one train a day, a mixed pas- </p><p>senger and freight, on which the train crew </p><p>were all called by their first names, and </p><p>whose intimate family affairs were known </p><p>to most all their passengers. The branch, </p><p>however, owing to its heavy strings of coal- </p><p>cars, boasted as fine a road-bed as any on </p><p>the division and was tracked with ninety- </p><p>pound rail. </p><p> When the big washout came in March, on</p><p>the main line between Stanton and Pen- </p><p>nington, the overland flyers were detoured </p><p>over the “Coal Dust Division,” as this fifty </p><p>miles was nicknamed. Everything went all </p><p>right until one of the big-train engineers, </p><p>maybe trying to show off before the won- </p><p>dering natives who had come in to every </p><p>station to see a real big train come in, took </p><p>the high-ball through Summerset at regula- </p><p>tion straight-track speed and piled up on a </p><p>curve, the crookedness of which he had </p><p>never dreamed. </p><p> Thanks to the steel coaches nobody was</p><p>killed, but after that the master mechanic </p><p>had one of the “Coal Dust” engineers go </p><p>through in the cab of every train as a </p><p>pilot. </p><p> The engineers of the Coal Dust Division</p><p>were all old men, grown gray in the service </p><p>and retired to this eddy of a great system </p><p>to work out the years yet remaining between </p><p>them and retirement on pension. Dad Re- </p><p>gan was one of these. He sat on one of the </p><p>high stools at the Railroad Lunch House at </p><p>Stanton and sipped a cup of black coffee. </p><p>He was waiting to pilot No. 3 over the </p><p>troublesome division. </p><p> The morning air was cold and the coffee</p><p>caused the old man’s pinched figure to swell </p><p>and thaw a little. His sparse hair was a lit- </p><p>tle grayer than his short mustache which</p><p>had once been brown, like his eyes. The </p><p>hand on the heavy iron-china cup was wrin- </p><p>kled and vein-shaped but did not shake. </p><p>As he blew the steam off his cup, and set- </p><p>tled back on the hard stool, one caught the </p><p>impression held by the company, that Dad </p><p>Regan was a mighty dependable man; get- </p><p>ing a little old maybe, but able to hold up </p><p>his end yet and proud of it. </p><p> Jim Hundley and “Stubby” Nelson, of</p><p>the light cruiser Topeka, bound overland </p><p>from the Atlantic to the Pacifit station, </p><p>were awake and stirring, according to cus- </p><p>tom, at s a. m. Their whole beings de- </p><p>manded their shipboard morning coffee. </p><p> “Naw sah,” apologized the porter, “there</p><p>ain’t no dinah yit. We don’t pick it up till </p><p>long ’bout nine.” </p><p> “But we want coffee,” complained the</p><p>two sailors, and Hundley idly let two silver </p><p>pieces strike together in his pocket. </p><p> “Well, sah,” said the negro, his wits</p><p>sharpened by the clink of the coins, “you- </p><p>all might drap off de train at Stanton. We </p><p>waits dar twenty minutes and sometimes a </p><p>mite longer ’count ob dis here washout. </p><p>Dar’s a good coffee place near-by de track.” </p><p>One of the coins made a hasty and safe </p><p>journey and ten minutes later the two sail- </p><p>ors hurried into the Railroad Lunch. </p><p> Dad Regan took a long look at the uni-</p><p>forms, started to speak a couple of times, </p><p>but not until the sailors had finished one </p><p>cup, ordered another, and turned to look at </p><p>their surroundings, did he see their cap rib- </p><p>bons. Then he came forward a little tim- </p><p>idly and asked a question. </p><p> “Are you two boys from the Topeka of</p><p>the United States Navy?” He spoke a lit- </p><p>tle huskily, as if under mental stress. </p><p> “Sure thing,” spoke up Stubby Nelson.</p><p>“Know anybody in the outfit?” </p><p> Dad Regan ignored the question and ask-</p><p>ed another. </p><p> “Did ye by any chance happen to be on</p><p>her a year ago last May?” </p><p> “I was,” he said, then waited, for there</p><p>was a tenseness in the old man’s tone which </p><p>interested him. </p><p> “Then ye must have known my son</p><p>Johnnie.” Dad Regan spoke hopefully, as </p><p>if an affirmative answer would be too good </p><p>to be true. </p><p> “What’s the last name? Maybe I did, I</p><p>know ’em all.” </p><p> “Regan. John Regan. He was killed,</p><p>you know.” </p><p> Hundley started to say something and</p><p>Nelson kicked him. Dad Regan was speak- </p><p>ing again. </p><p> “Yes, he was my boy, all that Ma and me</p><p>had. He got the fever and just had to go. </p><p>His letters was pretty blue too, wanted to </p><p>198 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>come home. But I wouldn’t humor him. </p><p>Then there come the accident.” </p><p> The old man paused a moment, and to</p><p>hide his emotion pulled out his watch. </p><p>Then he hurried on: </p><p> “Except for a notice from the Navy De-</p><p>partment that he was dead, we have had </p><p>no news at all. If ye knew him and know </p><p>about the accident, I’d be obliged if ye told </p><p>me. There’s nearly twenty minutes before </p><p>train time.” </p><p> Stubby nodded and held out his left hand</p><p>with two fingers gone. </p><p> “I got that in the same mix-up,” he said,</p><p>“and I knew Johnnie well. I’ll tell you all </p><p>about it.” </p><p> Again Hundley started to speak and Nel-</p><p>son halted him. </p><p> “Let me do it, Jim. I was in Johnnie’s</p><p>division. </p><p> “Regan came aboard the Panther while I</p><p>was a short-timer. I remember the morn- </p><p>ing well. A bunch of recruits came down </p><p>to the South Atlantic on the Prairie to re- </p><p>lieve the men going home. All the ship’s </p><p>company not on watch gathered around the </p><p>port gangway to see what we’d get. </p><p> “ ‘There comes a likely youngster,’ growl-</p><p>ed old Shorty Bray to me, and he meant </p><p>Johnnie Regan. In less than a week we’d </p><p>nicknamed him ‘Johnnie Reb’ on account </p><p>of the way he said ‘you-all’ and ah’d all his </p><p>r’s. Pretty soon we cut that—called him </p><p>J. R. for short.” </p><p> “He wrote about it,” smiled Dad Regan</p><p>happily. </p><p> “Well, he made good,” continued Stubby,</p><p>“took the drill, and the eats, which were </p><p>pretty bum after the Prairie left, and the </p><p>kiddixt’, like a man ought to. </p><p>“ABOUT that time we were per- </p><p>suadin’ Santo Domingo to be good, </p><p>and the boat J. R. was in came in </p><p>for an awful share of rough work. It would</p><p>have sickened anybody that owned a streak </p><p>of yellow as wide as a rope-yarn. </p><p> “I don’t know why they do it, but a lot</p><p>of recruits get the power-launch for their </p><p>small-boat duty. J. R. was one. Deck- </p><p>hand in the crew of five men. Night and </p><p>day, good weather and bad, that boat has </p><p>to run. First thing at daybreak they have </p><p>to hustle out to get provisions from shore, </p><p>a quarter of bloody beef maybe, and two or </p><p>three sacks of spuds; then along about nine </p><p>the captain has to go ashore on official busi- </p><p>ness, and boat and crew have to be spotless </p><p>and smiling. Then there’s the liberty par- </p><p>ties and the mail and twenty other things </p><p>which keep the launch crew humping them- </p><p>selves twenty hours a day. J. R. stood all </p><p>this fine, and I want to say right here that </p><p>if I had to have a steady job in a launch </p><p>I’d desert tomorrow. </p><p> “After six months of it the first luff saw</p><p>fit to put in somebody else and J. R. came </p><p>on deck. That boy certainly was glad. He </p><p>showed up the division in neatness with his </p><p>clothes, and put on his shoes again, which </p><p>no man ever needs in a launch. </p><p> “Then one morning one of the regular</p><p>chain-tierers was sick and the boats’n’s mate </p><p>grabbed J. R., always in the way for a job, </p><p>and put him in the chain-lockers. That </p><p>was the morning we had to beat it out of </p><p>our anchorage in a little place called Cor- </p><p>pus Christi, to keep from piling up on the </p><p>beach. The bay there is just a little cup- </p><p>shaped affair and safe enough with an off- </p><p>shore wind, but when one of those West </p><p>India storms come up and it blows in from </p><p>the old Caribbean, it’s no place for a ship </p><p>to spend any time. </p><p> “We were in a hurry to get out, of course,</p><p>and were rolling around pretty lively. J. R. </p><p>and a fellow named Shere were in the lock- </p><p>ers. The anchor-chain was something awful </p><p>to handle, covered with a kind of sticky </p><p>blue mud, volcanic they call it, and things </p><p>were in such a rush that we couldn’t take </p><p>time to wash it with a hose as it came over </p><p>the side, which was customary. </p><p> “J. R. and his partner were making the</p><p>best of a bad job when the ship gave a big </p><p>roll and threw Shere down. He tried to </p><p>scramble up but the slimy mud wouldn’t let</p><p>him get his feet under him. </p><p> “Left alone with the chain, J. R. did the</p><p>best he could, but with the mud and roll of </p><p>the ship some of that chain got away from </p><p>him and went across Shere’s legs. The two </p><p>of them shouted for help. That’s all they </p><p>could do. Shere couldn’t get out and with </p><p>the chain still coming it would soon have </p><p>him covered and crushed to death. </p><p> “In the noise on deck we didn’t hear</p><p>them. It was blowing like sin by then and </p><p>everybody was working to save the ship. </p><p>The first we knew J. R. came running on </p><p>deck. A kink in the chain had made the </p><p>man at the winch slack back a little and </p><p>he took this flying chance to get on deck </p><p>before we started to heave in again. </p><p>Hereditary Evidence </p><p>199 </p><p> “There was only half a minute’s delay,</p><p>and the chain commenced to come in again </p><p>before he could get to the boatswain. To </p><p>make himself heard he jumped up on the </p><p>taut chain and shouted to belay. Then it </p><p>happened. </p><p> “The chain struck another snarl, the</p><p>winch man threw on more power, and just </p><p>at the short break at the hause pipe the </p><p>chain parted. Poor J. R. caught the full </p><p>snap of it. It threw him twenty feet and </p><p>he struck on his head. Broke his neck. He </p><p>died instantly trying to save a friend.” </p><p> The sailor stopped. His story was end-</p><p>ed. Dad Regan cleared his throat and with </p><p>a voice betraying the effort to control it, </p><p>asked: </p><p> “The other boy? Did they save him?”</p><p> Stubby shook his head.</p><p> “Too late,” he said, and Hundley finished</p><p>for him: “That’s how Stubby lost his fin- </p><p>gers, trying to get Shere out. Couple of </p><p>fathoms of chain rolled them flat.” </p><p> Dad Regan slowly took his feet from the</p><p>rungs of the stool and stood up. </p><p> “I want to thank you two boys,” he said</p><p>still a little shakily. “I do wish that Moth- </p><p>er could have heard, too. Ye couldn’t stop </p><p>over and tell her?” </p><p> He faced Stubby squarely and the two</p><p>sailors could feel the almost piteous appeal </p><p>in his eyes. </p><p> Hundley wavered. Stubby shook his</p><p>head firmly. </p><p> “We have to report on time,” he said.</p><p>“Tell her for us. Tell her that all the boys </p><p>thought a lot of Johnnie Regan.” </p><p> “Thank ye both, then,” said Dad resign-</p><p>edly. “I hear the Westbound cornin’ and </p><p>I’ll have to be goin’. I’ll be ridin’ with ye, </p><p>but I’ll be in the cab.” </p><p> He spoke without boastfulness, yet with</p><p>pride. In turn he grasped the two sailors’ </p><p>hands, and the three walked out.</p><p> “I probably won’t see ye again,” he said</p><p>at the door, “but I’m mighty glad ye could </p><p>tell me about Johnnie. Mother’ll be glad, </p><p>too.” </p><p> Plainly unable to say more, he hurried</p><p>from them. They saw him jump briskly to </p><p>his place in the cab of the giant engine which </p><p>was to take them over the Coal Dust Divi- </p><p>sion. From the steps he waved a farewell. </p><p> “A fine old man,” said Hundley as the</p><p>two sailors walked to their coach. “But </p><p>Johnnie certainly was a throw-back. What </p><p>made you do what you did, Stubby?” </p><p> “I guess your first words answer that.</p><p>He’s a fine old man. I couldn’t break his </p><p>heart by telling him that his son was a low- </p><p>down, miserable coward.” </p><p> “You could have played ignorant,</p><p>couldn’t you?” </p><p> “And increase the old man’s suspicions?</p><p>Didn’t you see that he was worried because </p><p>nobody had ever written him the details? </p><p>And besides, I for one have never been </p><p>quite sure about Regan. All the ship ever </p><p>had was what Shere said when he was half </p><p>delirious, in the hour before he died.” </p><p>“Wasn’t that enough? What’re you driv- </p><p>in’ at? You know as well as I do that John- </p><p>nie Regan could have helped Shere out and </p><p>got out himself if he hadn’t had cold feet </p><p>and deserted like a coward. Shere said so </p><p>himself.” </p><p> “Yes, I know all that, and again it might</p><p>have happened just like I told the old man. </p><p>Honest now, did he look like a man whose </p><p>only son would have a yellow streak?” </p><p>“Johnnie looked good, too,” argued the </p><p>unconvinced Hundley. “His old man might </p><p>have a streak of yellow as wide as a squil- </p><p>gee, waiting to crop out when you least </p><p>expect it.” </p><p> Stubby shook his head.</p><p> “I don’t know, Jim. It might have been</p><p>one way and it might have been the other. </p><p>I did my best, anyway, for the old man, but </p><p>I	couldn’t stand to stop over and tell the</p><p>yarn again to the mother. The doubt’s in </p><p>my mind the same as it’s in yours. She</p><p>would have caught me.” </p><p>FUEL could be had almost for the </p><p>taking along the right-of-way of the </p><p>Coal Dust Division, consequently </p><p>the builders of the road economized in the </p><p>deep cuts and great fills which make for </p><p>easy grades, and used the coal. The road </p><p>went up hill and down dale, and the great </p><p>engines toiled laboriously up, spouting a </p><p>cloud of black smoke from their stacks, or </p><p>rolled ponderously down, with a roar of </p><p>grinding brakes. </p><p> Dad Regan with his heavy string of sleep-</p><p>ers, and mail and express coaches, stopped </p><p>at the summit of Squirrel Ridge for orders. </p><p>Below him was a long stretch of straight </p><p>track. It led down into the valley and then </p><p>up another ridge to the Honeycomb Mine. </p><p>It was the custom for the engineers to “tear </p><p>out a strip” going down in order to get a </p><p>running start for the stiff grade ahead. </p><p>200 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “All clear!” shouted the operator above</p><p>the roar of the panting engine, as Dad </p><p>Regan and his conductor came into the </p><p>little office for their orders; and a few </p><p>moments after Regan started his train down </p><p>the hill. </p><p> This particular section of the division was</p><p>one of its worst places. There was no switch </p><p>in the valley between, and if a coal-car or an </p><p>empty string got away from the busy yards </p><p>of the Honeycomb, after a train had left </p><p>Squirrel' Ridge, they ran together at the </p><p>bottom and smashed things up. </p><p> So far nothing serious had happened.</p><p>Cars had run wild, and once the local had </p><p>to back up the ridge in a hurry, but up un- </p><p>til the day that Dad Regan started down </p><p>with the Overland, there had been no wreck </p><p>worth the name. Even the request of the </p><p>roadmaster for a derailing switch had gone </p><p>no further than permission for the prelimi- </p><p>nary grading. </p><p> As Dad Regan came roaring down, he</p><p>kept his eyes constantly on the summit </p><p>ahead. At the Ridge he had waited for a </p><p>long coal-train to creep up and go safely </p><p>into the clear. He knew that since the big </p><p>trains were routed over this division that </p><p>every precaution was being taken against </p><p>an accident, but still he watched. As he </p><p>reached the bottom, going fifty miles an </p><p>hour, he looked away for a moment and </p><p>hooked the big machine up another notch </p><p>for the stiff climb ahead. When he looked </p><p>out again the thing that he dreaded most </p><p>of all had happened. His fireman saw it at </p><p>the same time. </p><p> “Dad!” he shrieked. “Dad! Look at</p><p>what’s cornin’!” </p><p> Dad had already looked. He shut off his</p><p>power, opened the sand and jammed on the </p><p>brakes. The heavy train, already taking </p><p>the grade, slowed almost instantly. Seven </p><p>loaded coal “gons” had broken away and </p><p>were coming down the hill without a single </p><p>man to set a hand-brake, even if that would </p><p>have done any good. </p><p> “When she stops, jump, and uncouple the</p><p>engine,” ordered Dad.</p><p> The fireman looked at him questioningly.</p><p>Dad picked up a wrench. </p><p> “Quick!” he commanded again, and the</p><p>fireman hit the ground at the same time </p><p>that the train came to a jerky, rumbling </p><p>stop. </p><p> There were two other things that Dad</p><p>Regan could have done—try to back his </p><p>train out of danger up the hill behind him, </p><p>or jump and save himself, and try to get </p><p>the passengers out before the coal-train </p><p>struck. Either of these two ways was dan- </p><p>gerous to his passengers, and comparatively </p><p>safe for himself. </p><p> The runaway was coming at such speed</p><p>that Dad felt sure they could not get away </p><p>by the first plan, and as for clearing the </p><p>coaches of their human freight, it was out </p><p>of the question, unless there had been ten </p><p>minutes for every one that was available. </p><p>There were babies, and invalids, and skep- </p><p>tics who would not leave their baggage, and </p><p>Dad knew it. He took the only safe course </p><p>to save his train, and had weighed the </p><p>chances and made up his mind in the sec- </p><p>onds while his hands were busy stopping </p><p>his engine. </p><p> He shouted once more and brandished</p><p>the wench as his fireman hesitated over </p><p>the automatic coupling. A moment more </p><p>and the coaches commenced to roll gently </p><p>away behind him, and he was free. </p><p> With the step of a man of thirty he sprang</p><p>to his levers and started the big overland </p><p>engine up the hill to meet the onrushing </p><p>coal-cars. They were coming in a cloud of </p><p>dust and with the rumble of a landslide. </p><p>Dad’s plan was to meet them head-on as </p><p>far up the slope as he could, and let the </p><p>heavy engine derail and wreck them. He </p><p>must stand by too, for the engine must have </p><p>speed and the grade was steep. From a </p><p>standing start there was precious little time. </p><p>Only an old hand—a master hand—could </p><p>do it. </p><p> Five hundred yards up the grade the en-</p><p>gine and the runaway met with a noise like </p><p>the crash of a battery of turret-guns. The </p><p>big engine, with sand grinding under its </p><p>wheels, and the power necessary to haul its</p><p>load across a continent loosed for destruc- </p><p>tion, scooped under the first coal-car, snap- </p><p>ped the couplings and sent it spinning end </p><p>over end down the embankment. With </p><p>diminished speed it met the second, derailed </p><p>it and crashed through its middle into the </p><p>third. The following cars piled up on the </p><p>mess, and the day was saved. The long </p><p>string of passenger coaches lay safe in the </p><p>valley. </p><p> Some of the passengers did not come out</p><p>to see what had happened until the crash </p><p>came, but Stubby and Hundley saw it all. </p><p>They started with the train-crew in a run </p><p>toward the wreck. </p><p>The Woman of the Desert </p><p>201 </p><p>“What do you think of it now?” panted </p><p>Stubby. “A man like that couldn’t be the </p><p>father of a coward.” </p><p> Hundley didn’t answer.</p><p>Ten minutes later they dug Dad Regan </p><p>out of the freshly dug earth of the half- </p><p>made derailing switch, poured water on him, </p><p>and found him all right. He had jumped </p><p>just at the last minute, and keeping his wits </p><p>about him, had picked his place. </p><p> That night the two sailors stopped over</p><p>after all. It was Hundley who told the </p><p>story of Johnnie Regan to the eager ears of </p><p>Johnnie’s mother. </p><p>Th.e'Wcmian.Of Tlie De sert </p><p>CattollIL. </p><p>Miclijetie^ </p><p>HE man named Gilbertson, </p><p>whom the natives called in their </p><p>language “the honorable for - </p><p>eign-devil pill-doctor,” peered </p><p>into the deepening dusk at the swaying fig- </p><p>ures of three camels. He stood at the en- </p><p>trance of the Chinese innkeeper’s stable- </p><p>yard, leaning slightly forward to balance </p><p>himself against the blasts of a shrieking dust- </p><p>storm. </p><p> The approach of the caravan had been</p><p>the first incident worth speaking of through- </p><p>out the long Winter day; though, if it comes </p><p>to that, scarcely any day in Chinese Turkes- </p><p>tan is characterized by incidents at all worth </p><p>recording. </p><p> Gilbertson made out the figures of two</p><p>persons in the caravan. As he watched, the </p><p>howling desert wind of a sudden beat up </p><p>against him with greater fury. It filled his </p><p>eyes with dust and left him choking and </p><p>sputtering. He rebuked it, as the Chinese </p><p>stablemen always did, uttering strange Chi- </p><p>nese oaths. </p><p> When he had regained his breath, the</p><p>foremost camel had brushed past him into </p><p>the stableyard and the second, mournful</p><p>and reeking with the grime of the caravan- </p><p>route, towered over him. He recovered his </p><p>vision in time to register genuine surprise </p><p>at the discovery that the rider of this sec- </p><p>ond camel was a woman. Women do not </p><p>often travel in Central Asia, much less Chi- </p><p>nese women of the upper class, such as was </p><p>this one, judging from her dress and the </p><p>patrician character of her features. </p><p> A crowd of stablemen, camel-drivers and</p><p>loafers surrounded the party as the camels </p><p>knelt, groaning with relief to be rid of their </p><p>riders. </p><p> At the command of her Chinese escort,</p><p>the woman stumbled after the innkeeper </p><p>into the gloomy interior of the inn and, so </p><p>far as Gilbertson was concerned, interest in </p><p>the incident ceased. He went wearily to </p><p>the frosty interior of his own room, and </p><p>shouted against its bare, dirty walls for his </p><p>coolie. That individual, so much swarthier </p><p>202 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>than the yellow of the Chinese that he might </p><p>justly have been suspected of Mohammedan </p><p>forebears, slouched into view from nowhere </p><p>in particular, and made no comment as his </p><p>master railed at him for failure to have the </p><p>charcoal brazier burning. He had been with </p><p>Gilbertson so many months that he no long- </p><p>er gave a thought to the eccentric demands </p><p>of his master. </p><p> Fire enough to heat the room, indeed!</p><p>With the desert wind sweeping into the </p><p>place from a thousand crannies! Why </p><p>didn’t “the honorable foreign-devil doctor” </p><p>do as the Chinese did—wrap himself in </p><p>layer after layer of clothing to keep out the </p><p>cold? Why waste fuel when there was </p><p>warmth enough in the blood? These “for- </p><p>eign devils” were strangely prodigal and il- </p><p>logical people. Nevertheless the coolie </p><p>made a show of complying, and soon had </p><p>sufficient charcoal aglow to warm his mas- </p><p>ter’s blue hands. </p><p> Gilbertson sat and thought of the Chinese</p><p>woman. There was little else to think of. </p><p>He remembered suddenly that her feet were </p><p>natural—unbound. She must, then, be no </p><p>Chinese at all, but a Manchu. </p><p> Her face, as he had glimpsed it in the</p><p>dusk, was attractive even to his Western </p><p>eye. It had the high forehead and regular </p><p>contour of the Northern Chinese. The nose </p><p>was not the typical retrousse of the Orient, </p><p>but almost Caucasian in proportions. Her </p><p>color was a bleached olive, rather than a </p><p>yellow—scarcely darker than the color of a </p><p>sunburned brunette of the Western Hemi- </p><p>sphere. </p><p> Her clothes were richly embroidered.</p><p>They were of unusual character for a trav- </p><p>eler on these distant roads. </p><p> Vong, the interpreter, who had become</p><p>head caravan man since his master learned </p><p>to speak Chinese effectively, came in and </p><p>squatted on his heels beside the brazier. </p><p>Gilbertson offered him Russian cigarettes, </p><p>but Vong shook his head. </p><p> “What’s the matter with you, Vong-ski?”</p><p>Gilbertson asked in surprise. “Homesick </p><p>again?”</p><p> Vong smiled faintly but made no direct</p><p>reply. </p><p> “This is very far from home,” he said.</p><p>“My wife, you know, will have another </p><p>baby soon. It is very cold here.” And </p><p>Vong edged closer to the faint glow of the </p><p>charcoal. </p><p> Gilbertson looked at the Chinese with</p><p>mingled disgust and suspicion. </p><p> “See here, now,” he said severely.</p><p>“Don’t you work yourself up into a funk. </p><p>Why, Lord Buddha, man! If you desert </p><p>me now look where I’ll be at! You can’t </p><p>do it, that’s all. I won’t listen to it.” </p><p> Vong looked funereally sober but said</p><p>nothing. </p><p> “How long before we can start?” asked</p><p>Gilbertson bruskly, after a few thoughtful </p><p>puffs at his cigarette. </p><p> Vong shrugged his shoulders and mur-</p><p>mured— </p><p> “Ten days.”</p><p> “Ten days! You’re mad as the Hung-</p><p>hutzes. We must start in five at the most.” </p><p>“Not enough camels. We must send for </p><p>them to the next town.” </p><p> “Nonsense. I saw forty in the market</p><p>today.” </p><p> “There are plenty, but their owners will</p><p>not sell. They ask too much.” </p><p> “How many have you now?”</p><p> “Only four, master.”</p><p> “Four will do if we can’t get more.”</p><p>“Four for the. desert road to Khotan?” </p><p>And Vong held up his hands in reproachful </p><p>denial. “It is a journey of thirty days. We </p><p>could take only half enough water.” </p><p> “But there will be ice in the water-holes</p><p>at this season until we get well into the </p><p>desert, and even then we can dig for water </p><p>in many places. The yamen people all say </p><p>so, from the governor down to the runners.”</p><p>Vong shook his head. </p><p> “These people who came in tonight—</p><p>where are they going? To Khotan also, </p><p>aren’t they?” </p><p> Vong nodded.</p><p> “They are two, and they have three cam-</p><p>els. We are three and we have four cam- </p><p>els. Enough for us, Vong-ski, eh?” coaxed </p><p>Gilbertson. </p><p> But Vong continued to shake his head.</p><p>There had been a time when he resented </p><p>the entirely foreign and irrelevant “ski” on </p><p>the end of his surname, but now he was in- </p><p>different. Plainly he was homesick for the </p><p>flat green country of the central Chinese </p><p>plains, the land thickly populated with the </p><p>houses of the living and the mounds of the </p><p>dead. He was thinking, too, of the bright </p><p>lights of metropolitan Shanghai, and of the </p><p>little house on Sinza Road, where his young </p><p>wife was about to give birth to another </p><p>baby. Perhaps a boy! </p><p> And so Vong Tze-miao was in no mood</p><p>The Woman of the Desert </p><p>203 </p><p>for thirty days of the desert—thirty days </p><p>of hardship and imminent danger in the </p><p>great, trackless Talka-makan. Why did </p><p>this foreign pill-seller want to go to Khotan </p><p>anyhow? Incomprehensible to the practi- </p><p>cal Chinese mind. It was to see the desert, </p><p>to dig for old bits of pottery and wooden </p><p>tablets in sand-buried desert cities, said the </p><p>pill doctor. Impossible ever to comprehend </p><p>these queer foreigners, who wished to risk </p><p>their lives and those of their servants for </p><p>nothing. </p><p> “In five days the post will be here from</p><p>Lanchow. Perhaps we can have a couple </p><p>more camels by that time. At any rate we </p><p>start then. Do you hear me, Vong?” </p><p> Vong shook his head but made no fur-</p><p>ther protest. </p><p> “By the way, what have you found out</p><p>about these people who came tonight?” </p><p>asked Gilbertson. </p><p> “Nothing,” answered Vong as if to dis-</p><p>miss the subject. </p><p> “Vong-ski, that’s old stuff. Come, out</p><p>with it. Every man in the place except me </p><p>knew their whole history five minutes after </p><p>they arrived. I’ll bet on that. Is she his </p><p>wife?” </p><p> Vong nodded.</p><p> “Number one wife?”</p><p>“Number two,” replied Vong laconically. </p><p>“Oh, a concubine, eh? Did he buy her?” </p><p>Vong gave way to his natural Chinese in- </p><p>stinct for gossip, and began with interest to </p><p>tell what he knew. </p><p>“THERE is an old Kashgar tea- </p><p>merchant here who has just come </p><p>from Peking. One evening the old </p><p>merchant, Yolban Khan, strolled in the Im- </p><p>perial City, just outside the walls of the </p><p>Forbidden City. He became confused in a </p><p>certain district where the streets are small, </p><p>and found himself in a narrow alley beside </p><p>the wall of a magistrate’s garden. The place </p><p>must have been very beautiful within, judg- </p><p>ing from what he could see in the twilight</p><p>through a small lattice. But scarcely had </p><p>he put his eyes to the opening for a better </p><p>glimpse, than the face of a woman appeared </p><p>on the inner side. He looked long at her, </p><p>for she was handsome. </p><p> “ ‘Go away, old man,’ she said to Yol-</p><p>ban Khan. ‘It is not you I want.’ ” </p><p> Vong laid aside his water-pipe and took</p><p>one of Gilbertson’s Russian cigarettes. </p><p>“That is why,” he resumed, gesturing </p><p>significantly toward the part of the inn </p><p>where the newcomers were quartered, </p><p>“that is why Yolban Khan knows of this </p><p>woman.” </p><p> “Well, go on,” urged Gilbertson. “You</p><p>Chinese are maddening tale-tellers. It takes </p><p>you so long to get to the meat of the thing.” </p><p> “Yolban Khan,” continued Vong, smiling,</p><p>but not in the least hurrying, “went on a </p><p>few paces, but so great was the woman’s </p><p>beauty that his footsteps lagged. And Yol- </p><p>ban Khan is an old man! He had not gone </p><p>far when the narrow street seemed to be </p><p>filled of a sudden with a big sedan chair and </p><p>a knot of coolies. Out of the chair bound- </p><p>ed a young man who first looked in through </p><p>the lattice where the old man had gazed </p><p>and then ran to a gate that opened for him. </p><p> “Yolban Khan heard the voices of the</p><p>young man and the woman beyond the </p><p>wall, and rejoiced in the boldness of youth </p><p>that thus with a fiery spirit defied the Con- </p><p>fucian law of love-making. But at that </p><p>moment came still a greater knot of men, </p><p>who grappled with the coolies and silenced </p><p>them. Some went through the gate, and </p><p>there followed cries and shrieks from the </p><p>woman. These ended and the men came </p><p>out carrying the woman and leading the </p><p>young man. There was the look of death </p><p>on the woman’s face, but she had ceased to </p><p>cry out. They closed the gate in the wall </p><p>and carried the woman away swiftly. </p><p> “Long after she was gone the young man</p><p>stared after her, struggling with his captors. </p><p>Yolban Khan regretted his age, which pre- </p><p>vented him from striking and slaying in re- </p><p>sponse to the call for blood that gleamed in </p><p>the young man’s eyes. But they led him </p><p>away, too—the young man—who sank list- </p><p>lessly into the sedan chair. As the chair</p><p>passed Yolban Khan, crouching close </p><p>against the wall, the old man gave a start </p><p>and rubbed his eyes to make sure he was </p><p>not mistaken, for he saw that the young </p><p>man’s official cap-button was of the im- </p><p>perial yellow! </p><p> “Yolban Khan is not unaccustomed to the</p><p>life of the imperial capital. He knew the </p><p>captors of the young man to be eunuchs </p><p>from the imperial household, because of the </p><p>garments they wore. One of the eunuchs </p><p>spoke to the old man sharply, but Yolban </p><p>Khan was able to excuse his presence. The </p><p>eunuch, thinking no doubt to overcome the </p><p>old countryman with awe at his part in the </p><p>adventure, whispered to him: </p><p>204 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “ ‘You see—the one in the chair? He is</p><p>the young Emperor!’ </p><p> “Yolban Khan believed. For there have</p><p>been many tales of the young Emperor’s </p><p>escapades by night, away from the Forbid- </p><p>den City. He is the Emperor, yet he is the </p><p>plaything of the ‘Old Buddha’—the Em- </p><p>press Dowager. She does what she will </p><p>with him. He is her slave.” </p><p> “But why should she have interfered with</p><p>the young Emperor’s love-making?” </p><p> Vong shrugged his shoulders.</p><p> “Yolban Khan says the woman’s father</p><p>was banished by imperial decree on the day </p><p>following. Very likely the ‘Old Buddha’ </p><p>feared an intrigue with the young Em- </p><p>peror.” </p><p> “This is all you know of the story?”</p><p> “This is all, master. There is nothing</p><p>more.” </p><p> Gilbertson watched the little caravan get</p><p>under way in the dawn. He saw the sad- </p><p>eyed woman come from the cheerless inn </p><p>and mount the waiting camel. </p><p> By Gilbertson’s side in the throng of sta-</p><p>blemen and inn-loafers stood the man called </p><p>Yolban Khan, Kashgar tea-merchant, and </p><p>as the woman settled herself to the seat </p><p>her eyes rested upon him for a moment in </p><p>a glance that lengthened into a stare. </p><p>Speaking almost as if in a dream she mur- </p><p>mured: </p><p> “Go away, old man. It is not you I</p><p>'want.” </p><p>II </p><p>AT NIGHTFALL, on the twenty- </p><p>sixth day in the desert, Gilbertson </p><p>sat on the crest of a great hill of </p><p>sand and watched Vong, the coolie and the </p><p>camel-driver who were digging feverishly </p><p>at the foot of the dune. The three men took </p><p>turns at the digging, and the one who now </p><p>wielded the shovel stood waist-deep in the </p><p>hasty excavation.</p><p> “Any sign yet?” Gilbertson shouted.1</p><p> Vong, coming up to be relieved, scram-</p><p>bled to the top of the dune holding out a </p><p>handful of moist sand. Gilbertson felt of </p><p>it with satisfaction, but Vong looked hol- </p><p>low-eyed disappointment. </p><p> “We must dig very deep,” he said, shak-</p><p>ing his head. </p><p> Gilbertson surveyed the limitless reaches</p><p>of sand-crests stretching away to every </p><p>point on the horizon. They were almost </p><p>mountainous here—the highest that had </p><p>been encountered—gathering into great east </p><p>and west ridges, like mountain-chains, at </p><p>intervals of little over a mile. Sometimes, </p><p>as on thisjlast day, the steep slopes of these </p><p>ridges had made it almost impossible for </p><p>the camels to cross. Their progress had </p><p>been scarcely a dozen miles since sunrise. </p><p> Vong gazed, too, at the sand sea darken-</p><p>ing under the slow twilight, and then looked </p><p>at Gilbertson in a silent reproach. </p><p> “- it!” shouted Gilbertson when his</p><p>eyes rested once more on those of the Chi- </p><p>nese. “Don’t look at me that way! You </p><p>give me the willies.” </p><p> Vong slid down the sand-slope without a</p><p>word and stood eagerly over the edge of </p><p>the deepening hole. </p><p> As he watched the three below him Gil-</p><p>bertson felt that they were discussing him. </p><p>There was a manner of hostility in the cov- </p><p>ert glances they cast upward toward him </p><p>as they spoke. </p><p> A wind blew more coldly upon him there</p><p>at the crest of the dune, and he shivered at </p><p>the thought that tonight there would be no </p><p>fire in camp. They had passed the last out- </p><p>posts of the dead tamarisk trees that linger </p><p>far into the desert—age-old tombed senti- </p><p>nels of the period when the sand-waste was </p><p>watered and fertile. </p><p> The digger’s head was out of sight now,</p><p>and Gilbertson scrambled down to share in </p><p>the toil. Crumbling walls made it neces- </p><p>sary to widen the opening of the pit and the</p><p>digging went on with painful slowness. </p><p> The sand thrown up from the bottom still</p><p>was moist but seemed to grow no moister. </p><p>Last night they had been compelled to dig </p><p>eight feet before they reached water. Then </p><p>the mud stratum, that might have been the </p><p>bed of a buried stream, yielded only enough </p><p>to half fill the water-bags. For the almost </p><p>exhausted camels there was nothing. </p><p> When they had been at work nearly three</p><p>hours, and the pit had reached a depth of </p><p>fourteen feet, they gave up the quest and </p><p>threw themselves on the sand. There was </p><p>no hope that water could be reached here </p><p>by digging. The desert wind shrieked bit- </p><p>terly at them with its breath of frost, as </p><p>they lay panting from their disappointed </p><p>effort. </p><p> After a time they rose and with one ac-</p><p>cord went to the water-bags, still unslung </p><p>from the wearied camels. There was enough </p><p>for tonight but none for tomorrow. The ice- </p><p>bags, too, carried for days from the last </p><p>The Woman of the Desert </p><p>205 </p><p>outpost of fertility, were almost empty. </p><p>There was enough, perhaps, for another </p><p>day’s march. </p><p> One by one the men drew cupfuls of</p><p>muddy water from the pathetically limp </p><p>water-bags. There still was enough for tea </p><p>to be made over the alcohol burner. They </p><p>ate their evening meal in silence. </p><p> Gilbertson rolled himself in his sleeping-</p><p>sack and lay down on the sand floor be- </p><p>neath his tent, and for a time listened to </p><p>the low voices of his men, trying vainly to </p><p>make out the trend of their earnest collo- </p><p>quy. It was easy enough to guess, and the </p><p>realization of it made him pull his revolver </p><p>from its holster and look at its chambers. </p><p>He had anticipated some such crisis and </p><p>was prepared for it. </p><p> Vong came into the tent, without apology</p><p>for intruding upon his master’s privacy— </p><p>something he had never done before. Gil- </p><p>bertson slipped out of his sleeping-bag and </p><p>the two confronted each other, squatting on </p><p>their heels under the low canopy. </p><p> “Tomorrow we go back,” announced</p><p>Vong. </p><p> Gilbertson laughed, a very dry and mirth-</p><p>less laugh. </p><p> “Go back? You’re crazy! The only</p><p>thing we can do is to go on.” </p><p> “No water,” muttered Vong sullenly.</p><p> “There may be water tomorrow—we</p><p>must find it. We can’t be more than two </p><p>days from the Keriya River, and then </p><p>there’ll be plenty of it.” </p><p> But Vong only shook his head.</p><p> “The coolie and the camel-driver—they</p><p>will not go further. They will go back.” </p><p> Gilbertson pulled the revolver from its</p><p>holster and examined it meaningly. </p><p> “They will not go back, Vong,” he said</p><p>in a low voice. “Look here,” he continued, </p><p>putting away the gun when he saw how lit-</p><p>tle effect it had upon the demeanor of the </p><p>sullen Vong. “We haven’t enough food to </p><p>last until we get back. And the camels </p><p>couldn’t stand it. They’re nearly exhaust- </p><p>ed now. We’ve been out twenty-six days, </p><p>and every desert-traveler since Marco Polo </p><p>agrees that it’s only a thirty-day trip. We </p><p>can hold out for two or three days more </p><p>even without water. And we’re sure to find </p><p>plenty of it by digging when we’re nearer </p><p>the river. There’s nothing for it but to go </p><p>on, Vong.” </p><p> “Water—no water,” was all Vong would</p><p>say in reply. </p><p> And Gilbertson turned from him in dis-</p><p>gust. These Chinese were children when it </p><p>came to anything like a crisis demanding </p><p>hardship and fortitude against known dan- </p><p>ger. </p><p> When Vong had gone Gilbertson drew out</p><p>the worn volume of Marco Polo’s travels </p><p>that had been the inspiration of his venture </p><p>into the desert, if there had been anything </p><p>like inspiration for it. He turned to the </p><p>passage in the immortal work that tells of </p><p>the great “Desert of Lop.” </p><p> Even to handle the volume was a refresh-</p><p>ing assurance. True, the Ser Marco had </p><p>not crossed this part of the desert, but des- </p><p>erts were much alike. What was true of </p><p>Polo’s “Desert of Lop” would be sufficient- </p><p>ly true here. There were many who crossed </p><p>the Takla-makan. He would by no means </p><p>be the first, though the route was little </p><p>known and much feared. </p><p> One could not go wrong, knowing the di-</p><p>rection and possessing the strength, Gilbert- </p><p>son thought. In four days more, five at the </p><p>most, he should reach the southern edge of </p><p>the desert, the goal of his expedition. Kho- </p><p>tan was the city from which he hoped to </p><p>make his explorations into the sand-buried </p><p>habitations of dead centuries. </p><p> Gilbertson was an adventurer who looked</p><p>to adventure as its own reward and its only </p><p>aim. If he discovered a buried city it would </p><p>not be to enrich archeology or geography. </p><p>He was not greatly interested in filling the </p><p>Smithsonian Institution with new treasures. </p><p>He was interested only in finding diversion </p><p>for Yoland Gilbertson, who claimed no home </p><p>but the world at large, and who was bound</p><p>by no ties save those of the universal kin- </p><p>ship. </p><p> It was this vagueness of purpose and ut-</p><p>ter absence of serious intent that had </p><p>prompted him to leave Harvard in the midst </p><p>of his work for a master’s degree and sail </p><p>for Europe on a cattle-boat. </p><p> A personal interest, but no particular</p><p>purpose, had led him to spend weeks in the </p><p>slums and among the docks of Liverpool. </p><p>Stevenson’s “Adventures with a Donkey,” </p><p>strangely enough, had inspired him to a </p><p>mendicant jaunt through Germany and </p><p>France, living, as he put it, “on the staff of </p><p>the universal brotherhood.” What impulse </p><p>had led him to Mexico he never was able </p><p>to say definitely, but the spy duty he un- </p><p>dertook for a certain revolutionist general </p><p>had its climax in front of a gray adobe wall </p><p>206 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>at daybreak in the Mexican capital, with </p><p>an attache of the American embassy dash- </p><p>ing up to the executioners’ squad just in </p><p>time to halt an unnecessarily violent flight </p><p>of Mauser bullets. </p><p> Various parts of South America had</p><p>claimed him briefly and to no particular </p><p>purpose, save once, to assist United States </p><p>army officers in cleaning up a fever dis- </p><p>trict. For this he was nearly rewarded with </p><p>death from the disease he fought. In Al- </p><p>aska he had found gold, but resigned it to </p><p>a woman whose crippled father held a bar- </p><p>ren claim next to it. The woman had wanted </p><p>to marry him, but he had no such notion </p><p>—never had such an idea at any time in his </p><p>life—so he went to a place as near as pos- </p><p>sible the antipodes. </p><p> It was not surprising that, finding him-</p><p>self in Shanghai and without funds, he </p><p>should have offered to sell pills for an Amer- </p><p>ican patent-medicine company. The man- </p><p>ager of the concern sent him forth in the </p><p>middle of the cholera and dysentery season </p><p>to canvass the villages of tie flat, reeking </p><p>Yangtze basin. </p><p> Gilbertson came back in a few weeks with</p><p>a creditable knowledge of Chinese, an un- </p><p>impaired constitution and tremendous prof- </p><p>its from the pills. Under the influence of </p><p>his oratory on street corners and in temple </p><p>yards the natives had bought his wares for </p><p>all ills. These marvelous pellets would cure </p><p>anything! Strangely, they did seem to work </p><p>miracles. The lame and the halt and the </p><p>disease - stricken had seemed to become </p><p>whole under the “foreign magic-pills.” </p><p> On his next excursion Gilbertson was sent</p><p>further afield. He tired of the r61e of heal- </p><p>er, and finding himself in the remote west- </p><p>ern provinces of China determined to desert </p><p>his employers and march away over the </p><p>deserts and mountains of Central Asia, along </p><p>the route of the great Marco Polo and on </p><p>to the almost obliterated threshold of the </p><p>back door of Europe. </p><p> Gilbertson put away the volume of Mar-</p><p>co Polo, blew out the candle, and, fingering </p><p>the holster of his revolver to give himself a </p><p>greater feeling of security, composed him-</p><p>self for sleep. </p><p>HIS hands were pinioned as in vises </p><p>when he came to a sudden, startled </p><p>awakening. His three companions </p><p>stood over him threateningly, and Vong was </p><p>unstrapping the holster of the revolver. </p><p> Gilbertson struggled vainly, then ceased.</p><p> They let him up and all four scrambled from</p><p> the tent. Outside they stood silently, de-</p><p> fiantly, under the cold desert stars, with the</p><p> sand-murmuring blasts of the great waste</p><p> shrieking through them.</p><p> “We go now—back to the last water-</p><p>hole,” announced Vong triumphantly. </p><p>“Then one man goes on with the strongest </p><p>camel for more food—more camels.” </p><p> “You can go and be- to you,” Gil-</p><p>bertson snarled at them. “I’ll stay. I’ll </p><p>keep going the other way—south. You </p><p>yellow vermin! A thousand curses on all </p><p>your ancestors!” </p><p> Gilbertson’sl rage and impotence gave</p><p>him a sort of giddy feeling. The air seemed </p><p>full of lights and noises. He wondered if </p><p>he were becoming suddenly ill. Then he </p><p>thought of the evil spirits with which su- </p><p>perstitious natives people the desert, and </p><p>laughed until his voice stirred disturbing </p><p>,echoes. </p><p> A passage from the book of Marco Polo</p><p>seemed to stand out before his eyes: </p><p>“Sometimes stray travelers will hear as it </p><p>were the tramp and hum of a great caval- </p><p>cade of people away from the real line of </p><p>road, and taking this to be their own com- </p><p>pany they will follow the sound; and when </p><p>day breaks they find that a cheat has been </p><p>put on them and that they are in an ill </p><p>plight. Even in the daytime one hears </p><p>those spirits talking. And sometimes you </p><p>shall hear the sound of a variety of musical </p><p>instruments, and still more commonly the </p><p>sound of drums. Hence in making this </p><p>journey ’tis customary for all travelers to </p><p>keep close together-” </p><p> Gilbertson laughed again in a voice that</p><p> caused his companions to glance at one an-</p><p> other with a curious significance. Then he</p><p> went into the tent, wrapped himself into</p><p> his sleeping-bag and tossed in a feverish</p><p> slumber until daybreak.</p><p> His companions were gone, he found, as</p><p> he left the tent. So were all but one of the</p><p> camels—the poorest of the lot—and this</p><p> one gazing with a patient yearning in the</p><p> direction his fellows had taken. Food</p><p> enough to last three or four days had been</p><p> left for him, and a small cake of ice. He</p><p> marveled at this human justice of the sand-</p><p> sea mutineers.</p><p> For an hour Gilbertson hesitated over</p><p>which course to take. Should he acknowl- </p><p>edge himself beaten and set out to follow </p><p>The Woman of the Desert </p><p>207 </p><p> his companions, or should he push on into</p><p> the unknown?</p><p> The devil spirits of the desert, of course,</p><p>were about him, whispering to be off—to </p><p>follow them into the waste. In the end he </p><p>yielded and went their way southward, </p><p>climbing laboriously up the slopes of the </p><p>great sand ranges, and at every crest strug- </p><p>gling against new disappointment at the </p><p>unchanging character of the landscape. He </p><p>must walk now, leading the camel, for the </p><p>poor beast, weakened by his long fast, was </p><p>sufficiently burdened with the meager camp </p><p>equipment. </p><p> Through the long day Gilbertson stag-</p><p>gered, and when night came he found him- </p><p>self too weary for digging. Half the pre- </p><p>cious ice went for his tea, and when he had </p><p>eaten he slept in a stupor of exhaustion. </p><p> Before dawn he was awake and had se-</p><p>lected a low gully between two towering </p><p>dunes for his digging. He found then that </p><p>his companions had taken the only spade, </p><p>so he was compelled to sacrifice the alcohol- </p><p>burner for conversion into a rude scoop. He </p><p>began an agony of labor that lasted for </p><p>hours, with only bitterness and exhaustion </p><p>for reward. The sand at six feet showed </p><p>but a slight trace of moisture. </p><p> A sort of calm resignation succeeded the</p><p>first panic of disappointment. Gilbertson </p><p>was able to whistle a few bars of the latest </p><p>popular song that had been going the rounds </p><p>of the Shanghai music-halls before he left </p><p>on this trip; but the whistling only aggra- </p><p>vated his thirst. He approached the silent, </p><p>wistful camel and looked into the beast’s </p><p>hopeless eyes. </p><p> “Not much longer for this world, are you,</p><p>old boy?” Gilbertson could not help saying </p><p>aloud. </p><p> The sound of his voice, so many hours si-</p><p>lent, startled him. A faint echo came from </p><p>the sand-dunes, and he looked up, half ex- </p><p>pecting to glimpse somewhere another hu- </p><p>man. The mute sand-crests, stretching in </p><p>endless confusion, rebuked his thought. </p><p> It was with difficulty that he got the</p><p>camel to his feet. The beast seemed to have </p><p>given up the fight. His vitality was gone. </p><p>He soon would be a part of the inanimate </p><p>void about him. </p><p> Gilbertson pitied the animal and would</p><p>have given him the brotherly caress a man </p><p>gives his horse had not a leering curl of the </p><p>lips warned him the camel probably would </p><p>maintain his attitude of vicious repugnance </p><p>toward humans even in the shadow of </p><p>death. Those foul teeth must still keep the </p><p>two from the intimate companionship of </p><p>common danger. </p><p> They swayed slowly through the track-</p><p>less sand, animate derelicts mutually repug- </p><p>nant but mutually dependent for life itself. </p><p>The gray sky seemed to creep down upon </p><p>them, and the wind seemed to mock </p><p>them with its spiteful buffetings of drifted </p><p>sand. </p><p> Gilbertson had let his watch nm down,</p><p>but he had little need of it. His eyes were </p><p>for the needle of his compass, and for a sign </p><p>of relief in the still unchanging southern </p><p>horizon. Time was of no consequence. For </p><p>him space was the only dimension, water </p><p>the only element that mattered. </p><p> Toward the middle of the afternoon the</p><p>camel faltered near the top of a dune steep- </p><p>er than any they had encountered before, </p><p>and slid feebly backward into the gully. </p><p>With a moan of infinite melancholy he </p><p>stretched his gaunt neck along the sand and </p><p>lay still. Though Gilbertson beat and kick- </p><p>ed at him, then spoke to him softly in the </p><p>words of Turkoman camel-drivers, the beast </p><p>would not respond. </p><p> Gilbertson lay down in the sand, his face</p><p>on his arms, and tried to think. It had al- </p><p>ways been his theory that the mind is </p><p>stronger than the body. The mind must </p><p>find a way where the body could not. </p><p> He reviewed the course of the whole ex-</p><p>pedition, counted over the number of days </p><p>they had been on the march, the estimated </p><p>number of miles traveled; he went over in </p><p>mind all the road lore of the desert that he </p><p>had picked up in the city at the edge of the </p><p>sand-sea, and reasoned that the sum of it </p><p>could not have led him astray. Truly, un- </p><p>less the compass was wrong, or the earth</p><p>altered, or the sun and stars changed in </p><p>their courses, he must, if he kept on, come </p><p>to the southern edge of the desert. To go </p><p>back—well, that was impossible now. He </p><p>must go on, as long as his strength held </p><p>out. That was the only solution. He must </p><p>go on. </p><p> Strength seemed to fill him—the strength</p><p>of desperation. He sprang up, fumbled </p><p>feverishly among the camp equipment on </p><p>the fallen camel for the small quantity of </p><p>food he must take, and the remainder of the </p><p>ice. It required tremendous force of will to </p><p>keep from consuming the whole of the piti- </p><p>fully small lump of frozen treasure in a </p><p>208 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>single orgy of gratification. But he crunched </p><p>only a little. </p><p> Gilbertson did not look back at the dying</p><p>camel as he reached the crest of the dune </p><p>and slid down into the opposite gully. His </p><p>haste was too great. He was devoid of sen- </p><p>timent. He had neither pity, nor remem- </p><p>brance, nor any emotion. There was noth- </p><p>ing in his mind save the compelling desire </p><p>to consume the one dimension that was of </p><p>any consequence. There was but one goal, </p><p>one aim in life, one thing of value—water. </p><p> He was not conscious of sand-hills or of</p><p>suns. Presently the stars were out but he </p><p>did not seem aware of it. He kept on, </p><p>toiling, panting, reeling through the night. </p><p> This could not continue endlessly. He</p><p>faltered at last near the top of a steep dune, </p><p>as the camel had done, and fell back, sliding </p><p>helplessly to the bottom. He tried again, </p><p>but exhaustion overcame him in the at- </p><p>tempt and he did not rise from the gully </p><p>this time, but remained, sprawling, face up- </p><p>ward to the stars. Then he slept. </p><p> The sun and his thirst awoke him. He</p><p>did not seem to feel the cold, though in it </p><p>was the chill of frost. Dazedly he felt for </p><p>the ice, and in a delirium of haste crunched </p><p>the last of his small treasure. When he saw </p><p>that it was gone a sober fear overcame him. </p><p>He reviled himself for having eaten it, and </p><p>threw himself down with his face in the </p><p>sand. There was almost childishness in the </p><p>petulance of his grief. </p><p> But the precious liquid had given new</p><p>life to his blood, and restored some of his </p><p>strength. He ate something and began to </p><p>stumble on, ever southward. </p><p> At nightfall his thirst was agonizing. His</p><p>lips were parched and his tongue swollen. </p><p>He was hungry, but he could not eat. Food </p><p>choked him; he could not swallow. </p><p> He began digging at the bottom of a gully.</p><p>In the intervals of utter exhaustion and </p><p>sleep that overcame him at times he con- </p><p>tinued digging through the night. At dawn </p><p>he had made a hole six feet deep. The </p><p>sand was moist but he knew that to find</p><p>water it would be necessary to go many </p><p>feet deeper. </p><p> Sitting on the edge of his dry water-hole</p><p>a thought came to him suddenly and made </p><p>him rage hoarsely at the sky. Why had he </p><p>not drunk the blood of the dying camel? </p><p> Then he ceased his shrieking at the sky</p><p>and wondered if he were going mad. </p><p> He decided to die, peacefully, respectably,</p><p>and looked about him for a sand-crest that </p><p>would be a fitting monument. When he </p><p>had chosen one he climbed to the top of it </p><p>and disinterestedly surveyed the sand-sea. </p><p> Afterward it seemed to him that he had</p><p>gazed for some time at an object below him </p><p>on the southern slope of the dune before he </p><p>realized in the least what it was. He was </p><p>aware that it was a dead camel long before </p><p>he perceived the significance of it. Then, </p><p>dully, the thought came to him that it was </p><p>his own camel, and that he had made his </p><p>way back to it through some sickening error </p><p>in the compass or in his reading of the stars. </p><p> But when he had rolled nearer to the ob-</p><p>ject he saw that it was not his camel. The </p><p>wind had driven the stench of it away from </p><p>him during the night but could not protect </p><p>him now. He was nauseated and his illness </p><p>for a time robbed him of the strength to </p><p>crawl away. </p><p> The sun shone full in his eyes, yet there</p><p>seemed to him to be a great grayness over </p><p>everything. Through this grayness he </p><p>gazed at a bit of curious silver inlay in the </p><p>saddle of the fallen camel, and managed to </p><p>crawl close to it in a childish fit of curiosity. </p><p> His reward was the ghastly discovery that</p><p>behind the camel’s body was that of a man </p><p>—unmistakably the Chinese official of Kho- </p><p>tan who had gone into the desert with his </p><p>Peking concubine. In the dead hands was </p><p>clutched a carbine, the muzzle of which now </p><p>was poked impotently into the sand. Across </p><p>the man’s face was dried a streak of blood. </p><p> In Gilbertson’s eyes the grayness in -</p><p>creased and then became utter darkness. </p><p>Ill </p><p>IN THE outlaw village nestling </p><p>along fertile banks of an out-crop- </p><p>ping of the desert-buried river, there </p><p>had been tremendous excitement all morn- </p><p>ing. The foreign man the wild-camel hunt- </p><p>ers had brought in yesterday was “ajive” </p><p>again, and the Chinese woman, whose hus- </p><p>band they had shot and afterward robbed, </p><p>sat by the man’s side talking in a strange </p><p>language. She had ceased to cry out for </p><p>death when she saw him, and now wept </p><p>gently as she talked. </p><p> The language Gilbertson and the Chinese</p><p>woman spoke was German. She had ad- </p><p>dressed him in German because he was a </p><p>foreigner and that was the language she had </p><p>learned when her father was on foreign </p><p>The Woman of the Desert </p><p>209 </p><p>service for the old Empress. He was able </p><p>to reply in German with what knowledge he </p><p>had gained of it in his vagabondage, though </p><p>each would have understood the other bet- </p><p>ter in mandarin. </p><p> “What is this place?” asked Gilbertson</p><p>weakly, when she had somewhat dried her </p><p>tears. </p><p> “It has no name,” answered the woman.</p><p>“The people are outlaws—they dare not </p><p>leave the desert.” </p><p> “How did they happen to find me—by</p><p>the way, what happened to you two, out </p><p>there?” pointing to the desert. </p><p> “They shot him,” she shuddered. “My</p><p>camel ran away with me, but they caught </p><p>him, and brought me here. The A mb an was </p><p>not killed, but fired at them from behind his </p><p>camel until they left. They are great cow- </p><p>ards. The chief, when he heard of it, made </p><p>them return. The Amban was dead, then, </p><p>and they found you there, almost dead too.” </p><p>“What will they do with us?” </p><p> “The old chief is sick. He fears death.</p><p>Perhaps if you give him medicine he will let </p><p>you go.” </p><p> “What will become of you?”</p><p> “The foreign gentleman knows what will</p><p>become of me—he knows well.” </p><p> Her look of graven resignation disturbed</p><p>him. </p><p> “You mean you will become a slave to</p><p>one of them?” </p><p> The woman nodded and fixed her eyes on</p><p>the dirt floor of the hut. </p><p> A group of villagers who had stood open-</p><p>mouthed about the pile of matting upon </p><p>which Gilbertson lay, were thrust aside by </p><p>a man who appeared to be one in author- </p><p>ity. He was a tall, powerful Mongol, with </p><p>keen, intelligent eyes. Clearly he was not </p><p>of the inferior breed of Turkoman camel- </p><p>hunters about him. </p><p> “Zahid Beg, the chief,” he said to Gil-</p><p>bertson in the Kansu dialect, “desires your </p><p>attendance. Can you walk, or must you be </p><p>carried?” </p><p> “I think I had better be carried into his</p><p>royal presence,” replied Gilbertson, though </p><p>there was no such levity in his tone as in </p><p>his words. </p><p> They picked him up and in a few paces</p><p>set him down in a hut larger than the others, </p><p>before the emaciated form of an old man. </p><p> “Medicine!” demanded the sick man in a</p><p>dialect that had to be translated. “Give </p><p>me medicine.” </p><p>14 </p><p> Gilbertson well knew that to the heathen</p><p>all white men are doctors. He had no </p><p>medicine save half a dozen capsules of qui- </p><p>nine and a handful of the despised pills he </p><p>had sold consciencelessly for all known ills </p><p>and all unknown. Still, he thought, it </p><p>might be well to experiment with the old </p><p>man. Gratitude, perhaps, would give him </p><p>his freedom from what otherwise might be </p><p>perpetual servitude. </p><p> “What is the reward if I make you well?”</p><p>he asked of the old chief. </p><p> The Mongol muttered hoarsely and drew</p><p>the edge of his hand across his throat. </p><p> “If you do not—” he threatened savagely.</p><p> But the old chief looked more kindly upon</p><p>the captive. </p><p> “Cure me,” he said, “and you shall have</p><p>what you ask: a garden, a house, a wife— </p><p>though of women there are few. You shall </p><p>choose from among them.” </p><p> The promise did not give Gilbertson great</p><p>satisfaction, but he thought he saw in it </p><p>some advantage. With all the impressive- </p><p>ness he could muster he took the old man’s </p><p>pulse, looked into his eyes, examined his </p><p>tongue, moved his arms up and down as if </p><p>in first aid for the drowning—and then drew </p><p>forth the pills. Rolling one into his palm, </p><p>he muttered over it solemnly the opening </p><p>lines of Virgil’s /Eneid, and_ then popped it </p><p>into the old man’s mouth.</p><p> With greater assurance even than the</p><p>haughty Mongol, Chang Ssu-yeh, Gilbert- </p><p>son disdained the carriers who had brought </p><p>him into the hut and strode forth to his own. </p><p> For three days the village paid homage</p><p>to him, though Chang scowled over it. He </p><p>ate of the fat of the oasis. Each day he </p><p>went with pomp and circumstance to the </p><p>chief’s hut and administered a pill. On the </p><p>third day the chief arose, walked from the </p><p>hut, and announced himself not only cured </p><p>but refilled with the fires of youth. </p><p> What a testimonial, thought Gilbertson,</p><p>this would be for the pill company if he </p><p>could but work it up into ad copy! </p><p> The Zahid Beg’s first official act was to</p><p>proclaim a public banquet in honor of the </p><p>great medicine man. At this banquet Gil- </p><p>bertson was plied with so much honor it </p><p>wearied him. The climax came when the </p><p>old chief announced Gilbertson’s reward for </p><p>raising him from a sick bed. </p><p> “The honorable pill-doctor,” said the</p><p>Beg, “shall have one of the finest melon </p><p>gardens. He shall dwell among us forever </p><p>210 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>as our brother, and he shall be a headman </p><p>of the village. For his wife he shall take </p><p>the woman from the desert, who comes also </p><p>from distant peoples, and knows his man- </p><p>ner of speech. I have said—so must it be.” </p><p> There were only two at the banquet-</p><p>board who did not join in the uproar of ap- </p><p>plause. They were Gilbertson and Chang </p><p>Ssu-yeh. Gilbertson did not notice Chang’s </p><p>glowering silence, for he was too busy with </p><p>anxious solicitude over himself. Neverthe- </p><p>less, with Chang for interpreter, he made </p><p>dignified response and accepted the chief’s </p><p>generosity. It was impossible to do less. </p><p> In three days, the old chief announced</p><p>further, would the nuptials take place. On </p><p>the morrow a house would be built to shel- </p><p>ter the bride. In the meantime, to respect </p><p>the proprieties, the woman from the desert </p><p>would be housed with the chief’s own fam- </p><p>ily. Let there be great rejoicing and a gen- </p><p>eral holiday. </p><p> Gilbertson strode away from the ruins of</p><p>the feast to refresh himself with air and with </p><p>contemplation. He still was too much of a </p><p>curiosity to go unaccompanied by a trail of </p><p>urchins and dogs, but he had lived in the </p><p>East long enough to become accustomed to </p><p>finding his needed solitude in entire indiffer- </p><p>ence to encompassing crowds of the curious. </p><p> He strolled through the straggling village</p><p>farther than he had gone before, and was </p><p>surprised to see the extent of ruined struc- </p><p>tures, half covered with sand, that spoke </p><p>eloquently of buried generations. From his </p><p>knowledge of the sand-smothered cities of </p><p>the desert, and the fabulous stories told of </p><p>the romance and the richness of them, Gil- </p><p>bertson recognized in this extensive reach </p><p>of ruin what probably was a city of many </p><p>thousand inhabitants. The treacherous and </p><p>inconstant river probably had shifted its </p><p>stream to another bed and left the city to </p><p>the fate of parching winds and drifting sands. </p><p>Now it was back again and feeding this col- </p><p>ony of outlaws into renewed semblance of </p><p>the city it once destroyed. </p><p> Desiccated timbers, impossible to say how</p><p>old, protruded from the sand—the gaunt </p><p>skeletons of houses. There were excavations</p><p>among many of the ruins, showing how the </p><p>present inhabitants had made effort to learn </p><p>the secret and reap the abandoned spoil of </p><p>the dead city. </p><p> There were two persons loitering among</p><p>the buried houses, Gilbertson discovered, </p><p>other than the collection of children and </p><p>himself. Following him at some distance </p><p>was Chang Ssu-yeh, and in advance of him, </p><p>unaware yet of his presence, was the Chi- </p><p>nese woman of the desert. He caught up </p><p>with her, and when she had overcome the </p><p>cultivated shyness of all Chinese women in </p><p>the presence of men he told her the old </p><p>chief’s decree. </p><p> At first she looked at him incredulously,</p><p>with black eyes round and wide in surprise. </p><p>Then a pink flush spread under the delicate </p><p>olive of her skin and her eyes dropped with </p><p>her averted face. </p><p> “Pretty tough for you, isn’t it?” he said,</p><p>speaking in the classical language with </p><p>words that expressed as nearly as possible </p><p>the terseness of the Anglo-Saxon. </p><p> She looked up quickly with an apprehen-</p><p>sive expression. Her features, more mobile </p><p>by far than those of any other Chinese </p><p>woman he had known, registered plainly a </p><p>growing alarm. With a start he understood, </p><p>and returned rather evasively, her gaze that </p><p>was filled now with more than doubt—a </p><p>gaze full of the tragic resignation that </p><p>marks the life and entombs the hopes of the </p><p>Orient’s women. </p><p> She thought:</p><p> “The white man does not wish to marry</p><p>me. But I wish to marry him. He is bet- </p><p>ter than these camel-drivers. I must kill </p><p>myself if he does not.” </p><p> He thought:</p><p> “By all the gods, Buddha, the woman</p><p>wouldn’t mind marrying me! She doesn’t </p><p>like the idea of tying up with one of these </p><p>dirty camel thieves for life. But I can’t </p><p>marry her. It would be something of an </p><p>adventure, but I couldn’t have a flock of </p><p>little half-breeds trailing around at my </p><p>heels.” </p><p> As they continued to gaze into each</p><p>other’s eyes she was thinking with a bitter- </p><p>ness of heart: </p><p> “He will not marry me. I am a yellow</p><p>woman to him. He does not know that I </p><p>am proud, too, like all Chinese women. </p><p>And I am better than Chinese—I am Man- </p><p>chu. My people would say it is a disgrace </p><p>for me to marry a white man. Besides, I </p><p>am not beautiful like the foreign women. </p><p>He could not love me.” </p><p> But this is what he was thinking:</p><p> “She is a beautiful woman. I have been</p><p>too long away from women. She makes my </p><p>heart beat faster. Why not? If I knew </p><p>whether we could escape-” </p><p>The Woman of the Desert </p><p>211 </p><p> The woman heard the sound of footsteps</p><p>in the yielding sand and turned her head so </p><p>that the jade pendants from her ears swung </p><p>sharply against her cheeks. She saw Chang </p><p>Ssu-yeh standing near them in the group of </p><p>staring urchins. Gilbertson looked toward </p><p>him without welcome. </p><p> Chang scattered the urchins out of hear-</p><p>ing distance and came nearer. </p><p> “We can escape,” he confided to them.</p><p>“How?” asked Gilbertson, troubled by </p><p>the expression of the woman’s eyes. </p><p> “There must be gifts and silks for the</p><p>wedding, and we have nothing here. I go </p><p>for it. The wedding must wait. The old </p><p>chief has said. It is only six days to the </p><p>great caravan route.” </p><p> “Are you going alone?”</p><p> “Two men go with me. The camels will</p><p>halt beyond the first great ridge of dunes </p><p>and wait until midnight. You must come </p><p>to us there—you and the woman.” </p><p> “But they will follow us. Are you well</p><p>armed?” </p><p> “There are guns here, but only a little</p><p>ammunition. The chief has it and guards </p><p>it as his life. He will give me enough for </p><p>safety, but the woman must bring the rest. </p><p>She must find it. Besides, we shall take </p><p>the best of the camels. Chang Ssu-yeh will </p><p>see to that.” </p><p> The three stood expectantly silent.</p><p> “Tomorrow?” asked Gilbertson.</p><p> “Tomorrow.”</p><p> Gilbertson found it easier to decide if he</p><p>looked away from the fear in the woman’s </p><p>face. </p><p> “It would be best to take a chance,” he</p><p>thought. “She will be safe in any event.” </p><p>The woman, with clearer penetration of </p><p>motive than the man, was thinking: </p><p> “I am lost. The Mongol desires me and</p><p>will take me. Yet I must go since the white </p><p>man wills it. Perhaps if I yield the Mon-</p><p>gol will not kill-” </p><p> And Chang, behind the yellowed-bronze</p><p>mask of his immobile features, thought sim- </p><p>ply this: </p><p> “It will be easy to cut the fool of a white</p><p>man’s throat as he sleeps.” </p><p>IV </p><p>GILBERTSON and the woman </p><p>stumbled through the frozen gravel- </p><p>paths leading to the first rows of </p><p>sand-dunes, pausing at intervals to look </p><p>back, breathlessly, to see if they were pur- </p><p>sued. It had seemed a forlorn hope, this </p><p>escape, so closely were they under the sur- </p><p>veillance of the curious villagers with whom </p><p>they lodged. Gilbertson had not found it </p><p>easy to slip away until long after midnight, </p><p>and then he could take with him little that </p><p>would be of service on a long trip through </p><p>the Winter desert. </p><p> For the woman it was still less easy, and</p><p>she came pitifully unprepared for the jour- </p><p>ney, yet clutching fearfully in her wide </p><p>sleeves a collection of cartridge-boxes that </p><p>it had been her assigned task to find. She </p><p>would not let him relieve her of the burden, </p><p>so Gilbertson put his arm about her slen- </p><p>der shoulders as the best means of assisting </p><p>her. She looked up at him, startled, when </p><p>she felt the pressure of the arm, then lost </p><p>her shyness in a breathless laugh. She </p><p>seemed to be developing new characteristics </p><p>— becoming a new creature — here in the </p><p>wild freedom of the desert wastes. </p><p> They had reached the dunes and were</p><p>picking their way carefully eastward. From </p><p>the top of each sand-eminence Gilbertson </p><p>looked for the light that should guide them </p><p>to the waiting caravan. </p><p> For an hour they toiled on, the woman’s</p><p>weary feet lagging and demanding frequent </p><p>rest. She seemed to lean with more confi- </p><p>dence now upon his arm, and with a great- </p><p>er abandon. He was keenly conscious of it, </p><p>too, and it gave him a sense of proprietor- </p><p>ship commingled with a certain aggressive, </p><p>protective feeling less easy to name. He </p><p>looked down upon the knob of smooth, </p><p>black hair that came just to his shoulder </p><p>and now and then rested wearily but ca-</p><p>ressingly against it. </p><p> Perhaps he was a fool to be leaving the</p><p>desert oasis. For leaving there meant leav- </p><p>ing her, of course, though she was going with </p><p>him. In the desert village it would not </p><p>have been impossible—the old chief’s vision </p><p>of a house, a garden and in the midst of it </p><p>the woman of mystery from the desert. But </p><p>out in the wide world—well, one must al- </p><p>ways be thinking of going home some time </p><p>for the remainder of one’s days, and one </p><p>can not go home with a Chinese wife. And </p><p>if he have a conscience he can not leave the </p><p>Chinese wife—and the children. </p><p> There had been many women in Gilbert-</p><p>son’s life, but they had been as ships that </p><p>pass in the night. He had boasted of his </p><p>lack of susceptibility. So there was little </p><p>212 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>excuse for him when, as they saw the cara- </p><p>van light at last from the top of a sand- </p><p>dune, he kissed the Chinese woman on the </p><p>lips and held her in an embrace to which </p><p>she yielded wonderingly. </p><p> Gilbertson discovered that a kiss elimi-</p><p>nates a woman’s creed, race and color, and </p><p>leaves only sex. The spontaneity of his ac- </p><p>tion and the warmth of her response dis- </p><p>turbed him, and he stood away from her </p><p>almost coldly. A dozen paces away he saw </p><p>Chang, who had come out impatiently to </p><p>meet them. Chang had watched them there </p><p>on the summit of the dune, outlined against </p><p>a cold moon, and his lips framed unuttered </p><p>Mongol oaths. </p><p> The camels went swaying into the night</p><p>and far into the day. There was no pur- </p><p>suit. Apparently the villagers, robbed of </p><p>their only successful means of combating </p><p>the fugitives, had been content to swallow </p><p>their rage. The pill-doctor was lost to </p><p>them, with his magic pellets, lack of which </p><p>might permit an early grave to enfold the </p><p>superstitious old chief. </p><p> At midday the camels were halted for a</p><p>brief rest and then urged onward wearily </p><p>till night. The men found water by dig- </p><p>ging, and Gilbertson saw that his old course </p><p>would have brought him to safety if he </p><p>could have held out. </p><p> The woman came to him as Chang made</p><p>camp, and in a voice that had fear and elo- </p><p>quence, gave him warning. </p><p> “You will be careful, my master,” she</p><p>said. “He will kill you.” </p><p> “Nonsense — Chang?” laughed Gilbert-</p><p>son. </p><p> But she put a finger on her lips and looked</p><p>a sorrowful rebuke. </p><p> “Why should he kill me?” asked Gilbert-</p><p>son more soberly. “All he wants is Zahid </p><p>Beg’s wedding-money and the camels, and </p><p>an undisputed trail into Mongolia.” </p><p> The woman looked at him pityingly, tem-</p><p>pering her impatience with fear.</p><p> Chang interrupted them, and though Gil-</p><p>bertson would not admit the thought of </p><p>treachery on the part of the Mongol, it was </p><p>easy to imagine the existence of a sinister </p><p>regard in the man’s eyes. </p><p> Chang said something to the woman in a</p><p>dialect Gilbertson did not understand, and </p><p>she walked away with him. To Gilbertson </p><p>there was something in her attitude that </p><p>suggested the cowering of a frightened child </p><p>under a blow. </p><p> He turned away and strode a few paces</p><p>into the desert. A cold wind blew across </p><p>the tops of the dunes and eddied into the </p><p>gullies with mournful soughing. There was </p><p>a thick haze over the horizon, and only a </p><p>few stars near the zenith were visible. The </p><p>blackness of the night was oppressive. The </p><p>sound of the wind gave creepy suggestion </p><p>of those evil spirits of old Ser Marco, calling </p><p>the unwary to destruction in the great </p><p>waste. </p><p> Of a sudden Gilbertson recalled that he</p><p>was totally unarmed. He had not even a </p><p>knife. He would not permit himself to fear </p><p>attack by the Mongol, yet he knew it was </p><p>folly for him to remain without means of </p><p>defense. Some weapon was necessary, if </p><p>not for his own security, at least for that </p><p>of the woman. Among the camp utensils </p><p>he had seen a beautiful sharp-pointed knife, </p><p>one that might have been used for the flay- </p><p>ing of wild camels. Of this knife he resolved </p><p>to possess himself. </p><p> Gilbertson made his appearance some-</p><p>what tardily at the meager evening meal. </p><p>He gulped his tea and munched dried melon- </p><p>rinds with a sort of nervous self-conscious- </p><p>ness that grew out of his furtive alertness </p><p>for a chance to purloin the coveted knife. </p><p>It was there, among the camp utensils, </p><p>gleaming dully in the light of the fire. The </p><p>intensity of his desire for it had grown until </p><p>the knife seemed to him now the most de- </p><p>sired object in the world. </p><p> When Chang, at the close of the meal,</p><p>picked up the knife and casually slipped it </p><p>into his belt, Gilbertson could have shouted </p><p>with rage. Then a feeling of the utmost </p><p>chagrin was succeeded by a sense of grow- </p><p>ing indifference that bordered upon reck- </p><p>lessness. He startled his companions by</p><p>laughing harshly, as he had done on that </p><p>previous occasion in the desert when he </p><p>found himself in the hands of a similarly </p><p>callous fate. </p><p> He went to a sheltered gully to windward</p><p>of camp, where the drifted sand was soft </p><p>and deep, and wrapped himself in his sleep- </p><p>ing-bag. What was the use of battling with </p><p>fate? If the Mongol meant to kill him he </p><p>would do it, no doubt. What chance had </p><p>he against a man armed with a gun and a </p><p>knife? Perhaps he might wrest one or the </p><p>other from him in personal encounter, but </p><p>could he, single-handed, hope to disarm the </p><p>man completely? </p><p> His mind hesitated a moment over the</p><p>The Woman of the Desert </p><p>213 </p><p>possibility of stealing upon the Mongol as </p><p>he slept, then dismissed the thought. </p><p>Chang had boasted of the fact that he slept </p><p>with his eyes half-open. </p><p> Strangely enough, Gilbertson slept as a</p><p>child sleeps. </p><p>CHANG lay in the lee of a camel </p><p>for warmth, the vileness of camel- </p><p>odor being in no sense a deterrent </p><p>to his hardened sensibilities. He fingered </p><p>the knife at his belt, and opening the cham- </p><p>ber of the revolver saw that it was filled </p><p>with cartridges. He placed no great reli- </p><p>ance in such affairs as this upon the gun. </p><p>In fact he had always looked with a good </p><p>deal of suspicion upon this invention of the </p><p>foreign devil. </p><p> The knife—that was the thing.</p><p> Tucking the revolver into the folds of his</p><p>outer garment he felt once more the keen </p><p>edge of the blade, then slipped it again into </p><p>his belt, lying back into the sand, waiting. </p><p>The woman was becoming too fond of the </p><p>foreigner. He could see that in her eyes. </p><p>It was better that it should end at once. </p><p>There would be one less mouth to feed, and </p><p>there was not too much food to last until </p><p>they could get more. </p><p> The woman, under her tiny tent of skins,</p><p>lay in an icy trembling. She had resolved </p><p>to sacrifice herself for the man—no uncom- </p><p>mon thing in a land whose literature and </p><p>tradition are most richly adorned by the </p><p>heroic sacrifices of women, but one never- </p><p>theless to cause this one to tremble. It was </p><p>the sort of sacrifice hundreds of thousands </p><p>of women have made in the East to the call </p><p>of filial piety. </p><p> The woman’s trembling ceased when she</p><p>rose and stole softly from the tent. A sil- </p><p>ver crescent of moon etched dim outlines </p><p>into the desolate landscape. She made out </p><p>the forms of the camels and went toward </p><p>them, very slowly, fearful even of the wraith </p><p>of shadow that followed her. </p><p> In the lee of the first camel lay the man</p><p>to whom she must give herself in an effort </p><p>to disarm him of that weapon which other-</p><p>wise would slay the foreigner. The white </p><p>man—this was all that caused her to hesi- </p><p>tate, for she had no fear for herself—might </p><p>not understand. He might abandon her, </p><p>even kill her, for what she was about to do. </p><p> These foreigners, she knew, had strange</p><p>ideas concerning the value of a woman’s </p><p>bodily purity. Thus, success might mean </p><p>disaster equally as great as failure; yet she </p><p>was determined to possess herself of that </p><p>weapon about which all life now seemed to </p><p>revolve. </p><p> The woman knelt swiftly at the side of</p><p>the sleeping Mongol. Shudderingly she pre- </p><p>pared to waken him with a caress of aban- </p><p>donment. She saw the gleam of his eyes </p><p>through thin slits between his eyelids, and </p><p>wondered if he were awake. But his breath- </p><p>ing was regular; he was asleep—asleep with </p><p>his eyes open, as he had so often boasted. </p><p> Her hesitation gave time for a discovery</p><p>that startled her heart into a wild crescendo. </p><p>From an opening in his cotton-padded outer </p><p>garment protruded the butt of the revolver. </p><p> With the movement of a cat poised for</p><p>recoil she touched it, closed her fingers </p><p>about it, and, keeping her eyes upon his </p><p>face, slowly pulled it forth. Primitive in- </p><p>stinct almost overpowered her. Rage welled </p><p>up within her breast as if in compensation </p><p>for her previous fear. Consciousness of </p><p>power made her exult in a desire to kill, to </p><p>be revenged. </p><p> She knew nothing of guns, but undoubt-</p><p>edly could shoot him as he lay. Yet she </p><p>stole away, triumphantly, lightly, her soul </p><p>in a transport of exultation. It was a tri- </p><p>umph no less keen than if she had made </p><p>her sacrifice. Having desired and dared the </p><p>sacrifice, hers must still be the credit in her </p><p>own soul. </p><p> “It is the man’s place to kill,” she mut-</p><p>tered to herself as she stumbled through the </p><p>sand, carrying the weapon to Gilbertson. </p><p> But her knees suddenly became unsteady,</p><p>the beating of her heart oppressive. She </p><p>must rest awhile. Under the rude tent of </p><p>skins she held the gun to her cheek and </p><p>trembled once more with weakness and fear. </p><p> Chang, dreaming of his native Mongol</p><p>village, with wild flowers blooming in the </p><p>wide pastures and the Chinese woman of </p><p>the desert by his side in the doorway of an </p><p>adobe hut, awoke suddenly and cursed him- </p><p>self for having slept. It seemed to him in </p><p>his dream that the Chinese woman had </p><p>drawn a knife from his belt and thrust it </p><p>feebly against his breast. He reached for </p><p>the knife, now that he was awake, and was </p><p>reassured by the touch of the cold blade. </p><p> He had not intended to sleep. There</p><p>must be no sleep for him until the white </p><p>man was out of the way. Perhaps this </p><p>would be the best time. Why wait any </p><p>longer? </p><p>214 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Chang rose from the foul warmth of the</p><p>camel’s bed and looked toward the gully </p><p>where Gilbertson lay. He had no thought </p><p>of the distrusted revolver, but kept his hand </p><p>caressingly upon the handle of the knife. </p><p> Gilbertson awoke with a premonition so</p><p>clear and ghastly it left no doubt in his </p><p>mind as to the intent of the dark figure </p><p>that bent menacingly over him. With a </p><p>stifled cry he sprang as the Mongol’s knife </p><p>fell, and spoiled the aim of the blow. </p><p> All the strength he could command was</p><p>centered in a convulsive lurch toward </p><p>Chang’s feet. He grappled them, and tug- </p><p>ged with such a tempestuous fury that the </p><p>Mongol reeled and fell heavily backward. </p><p>The sleeping-blanket hampered the white </p><p>man’s efforts to get to his feet and the </p><p>Mongol was up before him. </p><p> The great weight of the man’s body,</p><p>lunging fiercely at Gilbertson, carried him </p><p>helplessly into the sand, but he grasped the </p><p>hand that held the knife, and, holding it to </p><p>his mouth, tore savagely at the tendons of </p><p>the wrist with his teeth. No sound of agony </p><p>came from the Mongol, but taking the knife </p><p>into his left hand he plunged it swiftly, sure- </p><p>ly, into the white man’s side. </p><p> The woman, in her tent, heard nothing</p><p>save the wind that shrieked like an endless </p><p>troupe of demons over the crests of sand. </p><p>When she had regained her strength she </p><p>went out toward the gully where Gilbert- </p><p>son lay. She was in time to see the pitiful </p><p>struggle that ended in a moan from the </p><p>white man and a quivering into helpless re- </p><p>laxation. </p><p> As Chang stood up over his victim, a</p><p>leer of barbaric satisfaction curling his Ups, </p><p>the woman confronted him. She could not </p><p>have told how she managed it, but in her </p><p>hands the gun spoke, shaking the solitude </p><p>of the desert. Before the Mongol fell she </p><p>shot again, and then, standing over his </p><p>quiet form she made the gun blaze vivid </p><p>paths of flame into his body until its cham- </p><p>ber was empty and only successive empty </p><p>clicks answered the movement of her fin- </p><p>ger on the trigger. </p><p>V </p><p>VONG found them there in the early </p><p>forenoon, the woman in a ghastly </p><p>hysteria, the camel-drivers helpless </p><p>with terror, and Gilbertson moaning in his </p><p>blood beside the body of the Mongol. </p><p> The great caravan of which Vong was a</p><p>member halted there all day, and camped </p><p>there at night, though it was far from a </p><p>water-hole. There were Chinese officials </p><p>wearing insignia of the court at Peking in </p><p>the caravan, and a guard of soldiers from </p><p>Hami. The officials looked upon it as a </p><p>miracle that the woman of whom they had </p><p>come in search should have been found </p><p>thus. They weighed secretly, in anticipa- </p><p>tion, the gold of their reward. The sur- </p><p>prise had been accented by the discovery </p><p>three days before of a dead camel and be- </p><p>side it the Ambon's rotting corpse. </p><p> To Vong the discovery of Gilbertson was</p><p>no less a surprise after encountering, five </p><p>days previously, Gilbertson’s dead “ship of </p><p>the desert” and his camp outfit, half buried </p><p>in drifted sand! </p><p> Delirium came to Gilbertson before he</p><p>understood the cause of his deliverance, and </p><p>the delirium continued over the slow desert </p><p>marches that brought him on an improvised </p><p>stretcher, carried by camel-drivers, into the </p><p>city of Khotan. The mission-doctor treated </p><p>him there and the verdict was slow recovery. </p><p> To the house of the missionary, when Gil-</p><p>bertson regained consciousness, came the </p><p>woman of the desert. They looked into </p><p>each other’s eyes in silence for a long time </p><p>before speaking. Even when they spoke it </p><p>was not to make clearer their understand- </p><p>ing. </p><p> “This is a wonderful woman,” thought</p><p>Gilbertson. “Beautiful, courageous, a wo- </p><p>man to whom life would be the least of all </p><p>sacrifices for the man she loved. If she </p><p>were only white I would marry her.” </p><p> “I thought I loved the young emperor,”</p><p>was what ran through the woman’s mind. </p><p>“But this white man is the one who is mas- </p><p>ter of my soul. I would willingly give up </p><p>the life of luxury to which I am recalled in </p><p>the emperor’s household for this wandering </p><p>foreigner. He will not marry me, but I</p><p>would be content as his slave, his plaything. </p><p>Yet he is too honorable, according to the </p><p>foolish standards they call morals in his </p><p>country, to have me for a mistress—or per- </p><p>haps too wise, since it would be dishonor </p><p>to him.” </p><p> Her soul was very full of a great sickness,</p><p>but the smile that played upon her face was </p><p>the studied smile of the stoic East that so </p><p>skilfully conceals the ills of the soul. When </p><p>she spoke it was only to say: </p><p> “Tomorrow, O honorable one, the caravan</p><p>The Camp-Fire </p><p>215 </p><p>returns across the desert. I am going </p><p>back to Peking, to become the young em- </p><p>peror’s third wife. I do not wish to go.” </p><p>“Stay here then,” was what impulse urged </p><p>him to say, but his spoken rejoinder was: </p><p>“Has your father regained the confidence </p><p>of the Old Buddha, then?” </p><p> She nodded.</p><p> “He has become a viceroy.”</p><p> There seemed to be nothing more to say,</p><p>yet she sat there a long time, silent, before </p><p>she went away. </p><p> When she was gone Gilbertson projected</p><p>himself into a new delirium by leaping from </p><p>the bed to go in search of the woman—to </p><p>hold her, to keep her, to beg her to stay. </p><p>The half-healed wound opened anew and </p><p>the mission doctor looked upon him with a </p><p>somber countenance. </p><p> The delirium went away and Gilbertson’s</p><p>mind became clear again. Vong came and </p><p>bent over him. Gilbertson remembered the </p><p>perdition to which he had consigned Vong </p><p>on the desert march, and marveled at the </p><p>man’s fidelity. Vong could have taken Gil- </p><p>bertson’s silver, but he had not. Instead, </p><p>he had brought it from the pack on the </p><p>dead camel. It was all there, every ounce. </p><p> “Have you had any word from the little</p><p> wife?” asked Gilbertson kindly.</p><p> “She has another son,” smiled the inter-</p><p> preter.</p><p> After an interval, closing his eyes, Gil-</p><p> bertson asked in a faint voice—</p><p>“The woman, Vong—where is she?” </p><p>“Gone.” </p><p>“How long, Vong?” </p><p> “Five days.”</p><p> Gilbertson turned his face to the wall</p><p> and cursed his conventional Western soul.</p><p>THE CAMP-FIRE </p><p>AMEETING-PLACE FOR, </p><p>READERS, WRITERS AND </p><p>ADVENTURERS </p><p>/^ARROLL K. MICHENER, with his </p><p>first story in our magazine, follows our </p><p>custom and stands up to introduce himself: </p><p> There is nothing more stimulating to the imagina-</p><p>tion than to stand at the great gates of Peking, and </p><p>watch the camel caravans filing in with their silent, </p><p>shuffling tread, ending a journey that may have </p><p>brought them from the very center of the continent. </p><p>What endless stretches of desert sands they have </p><p>traversed, what solitudes, what cities, what moun- </p><p>tains and valleysl They stir up untold images of </p><p>the people and places, beyond the Great Wall </p><p>through which they have passed not long since in </p><p>their descent from the Mongol mountains to the </p><p>fertile plains of China. </p><p>TT WAS such a caravan as one of these, dust- </p><p>grimed, wearied, shuffling in through the great </p><p>south gate of the Tartar city of Peking, that was the </p><p>inspiration of my story, “The Woman of the Des- </p><p>ert.” And into the story I put a bit of the per- </p><p>sonality of a real man, a friend, .one of the truest </p><p>adventurers living, and a bit of the life he has lived. </p><p>It is not his story, the story of the man and the </p><p>woman in the desert, but the web of it is spun from </p><p>yam raveled for me from his adventures, sitting </p><p>through long, hot nights in a newspaper office in </p><p>Shanghai. </p><p> I have never crossed a desert, but desert lore has</p><p>always had a fascination for me. I shall cross a </p><p>desert before I die, or the Fates are unkind. They </p><p>were unkind once, when they laid me low with a </p><p>Far Eastern fever while I contemplated a fleeting </p><p>opportunity to cross Asia by unbeaten paths from </p><p>the Pacific to the Mediterranean, but I do not cher- </p><p>ish it against the Fates, with whom it is well for an </p><p>adventurer to be on good terms. </p><p>jDUT though I have not crossed a desert in fact, </p><p>I have passed through all the waste places in </p><p>the Eastern hemisphere with the greatest of the ex- </p><p>plorers. Of these, my favorite companion of the </p><p>travel-books has been the incomparable Sven Hedin, </p><p>the greater part of whose lifetime has been spent in </p><p>trekking through the unknown or little-known re- </p><p>gions of Asia. From him and from my friend the </p><p>adventurer—who really is a pill-seller in darkest </p><p>Asia!—I have borrowed whatever there is of desert </p><p>lore in “The Woman of the Desert.” The custom </p><p>of carrying ice in a blanket through the deserts will</p><p>not seem strange to those who are familiar with </p><p>Sven Hedin—nor will a thousand strange things con- </p><p>cerning the peoples and places of remote Asia that </p><p>might have been borrowed into the tale. </p><p>T’M A little shy of speaking about myself, so </p><p>even though the Camp-Fire offers an incom- </p><p>parable opportunity, I’m going to be brief. I’m a </p><p>216	Adventure</p><p>newspaper man who has haunted the newspaper </p><p>offices of many cities in the United States. My only </p><p>real claim to capital adventure, however, is having </p><p>worked my way around the world as a newspaper </p><p>writer, picking up a job wherever I landed “broke,” </p><p>and staying until I had enough to move on. I went </p><p>leisurely, stopping when it pleased me to stop long, </p><p>and the journey took three and a half years. Ha- </p><p>waii claimed me for many months, then Japan; but </p><p>China held me longest. I loathed the country when </p><p>I first set foot in it, but learned to love it—and </p><p>stayed a year! _ </p><p>/~\LD-TIME members of the Camp-Fire </p><p>will be glad to know that at this writ- </p><p>ing the last report (from Montevideo, Uru- </p><p>guay) on our old friend Captain Fritz Du- </p><p>quesne states that he was merely severely </p><p>wounded in his expedition’s fight with hos- </p><p>tile Indians near the Bolivian border of the </p><p>Argentine, not killed as was first cabled </p><p>from Buenos Aires to the newspapers here. </p><p> After several years of silence during his</p><p>former expedition up the Amazon I and </p><p>others got brief word from him that after a </p><p>bad time with fever he was again all right </p><p>and was soon to sail for this country. But </p><p>on the eve of departure came the chance to </p><p>command the Bolivian expedition and he </p><p>couldn’t resist. The last report says he was </p><p>found by troops somewhere along the Pilco- </p><p>mayo River, which divides Paraguay from </p><p>the Argentine, after a fight in which his </p><p>party were victorious. </p><p>SO MANY new readers of Adventure </p><p>have joined our ranks of late that it </p><p>would seem the part of good-fellowship for </p><p>all of us old members of the Camp-Fire to </p><p>stand up in our places and welcome them </p><p>with a friendly greeting.

M. Muhlig, County</p><p>^ Superintendent of Schools for Will </p><p>County, Illinois, wrote to me suggesting </p><p>that it would make excellent reading if the </p><p>magazine could get the full story of the </p><p>“Gang from Pincher’s Creek.” I wrote </p><p>Mr. Muhlig, hoping he himself could give us </p><p>the tale, but he had not the time for this. </p><p>He did, however hastily jot down the story </p><p>in brief for me, to pass on to the Camp- </p><p>Fire. How many of you know about it? It </p><p>would seem, as Mr. Muhlig says, too worthy </p><p>for oblivion. </p><p> Received your reply to my inquiry as to the story</p><p>of the “Gang from Pincher’s Creek.” Hope you </p><p>can get it from some one posted. I can not tell it, </p><p>but the “Gang” consisted of three men who en- </p><p>listed from “Pincher’s Creek,” which is in Alberta. </p><p>They came from Montana to Canada. They pro- </p><p>claimed frankly to the world and the British </p><p>army in particular that they were from Pincher’s </p><p>Creek. </p><p> Their abilities as horsemen and their plains’ ex-</p><p>perience made them invaluable as scouts. As they </p><p>were inseparable they scouted together. </p><p>U PON one of their scouts they discovered the </p><p>approach of a large body of Boers who were </p><p>heading for a pass which, if occupied, would have </p><p>formed a fatal ciU de sac for a hundred or more Brit- </p><p>ish who had been detached from the main force. </p><p>There was no lime to rush for reinforcements or to </p><p>warn the endangered British. There was but one </p><p>thing to do—delay the Boers until the British had </p><p>passed through the neck of the trap. </p><p> Without hesitation they did this. The British</p><p>came through without molestation, but a search </p><p>party found the “Gang from Pincher’s Creek” lying </p><p>dead among the rocks where their heroic stand was </p><p>made. The ground was dotted with empty shells. </p><p>The three cartridge-belts were found by the side of </p><p>one man who was evidently the last one alive. </p><p>Every cartridge had been fired. The bodies were </p><p>riddled with rifle balls. It was ascertained that at </p><p>least thirty Boers died there. </p><p>'T'HE account of this was read in genera! orders </p><p>to the men of the British army and I have </p><p>heard that a monument was erected where they fell. </p><p>Some old “scout” who served with Baden-Powell </p><p>will remember the reading of the orders. The inci- </p><p>dent is too worthy for oblivion.—F. M. Muhlig. </p><p>DY WAY of introduction from M. F. </p><p> Brooks, concerning his story in this</p><p>issue: </p><p> Old Wade and Measles are real characters, with</p><p>whom I have for years been associated in trips in </p><p>the mountains and valleys of California. I have put </p><p>in years in Death Valley and the Mojave Desert </p><p>and I try to introduce into each story locations </p><p>and details that are real and descriptive of this </p><p>remarkable territory so little known to the people </p><p>generally.	_</p><p>TO THE Red-Heads, the Gray-Heads, </p><p>American Foreign Legion, Highland </p><p>Brigade, and the other similar regiments </p><p>has been added the suggestion of a Musi- </p><p>cians’ Regiment, by R. S. Edmiston of the </p><p>The Camp-Fire	217</p><p>Second Ind. Band, Miss. N. G., Quitman, </p><p>Miss. Also a regiment of Tropical Tramps, </p><p>by G. G. Lansing, 172 Ridgewood Ave., </p><p>Ridgewood, N. J., who will act as temporary </p><p>organizer. </p><p> As stated previously, the important point</p><p>back of all these suggestions is the plan of </p><p>naming and recruiting regiments according </p><p>to their members’ common ancestry, tra- </p><p>ditions, physical characteristics, etc., thus </p><p>getting value, at no expense, from that very </p><p>practical thing, esprit de corps. Our present </p><p>system of designating regiments merely by </p><p>dry, almost meaningless and undistinguish- </p><p>ing numbers is stupid. </p><p> I know quite well that most of these regi-</p><p>ments will not materialize. Unless this </p><p>country should be plunged into war. (The </p><p>Civil and the Spanish wars developed simi- </p><p>lar organizations.) Or unless, as in the case </p><p>of a few of them, some one or more of you </p><p>take hold of the actual work of organizing </p><p>and push it through. But all of them help a </p><p>little in the work for Defense, and back of </p><p>all of them is this idea of added esprit de </p><p>corps, which only those unfamiliar with </p><p>military affairs will dismiss as not being ex- </p><p>tremely practical and important. </p><p>THIS thing of truth’s being stranger than </p><p>fiction makes an editor a lot of trouble. </p><p>Frequently we reject a story because it is </p><p>“unconvincing” or “sounds improbable.” </p><p>Sometimes the author writes back in wrath </p><p>or glee and tells us the story is strictly based </p><p>on fact. He feels he “has it on” us. He </p><p>hasn’t. He has simply forgotten that a </p><p>story that is pure fiction may be so well and </p><p>so naturally told that it sounds entirely </p><p>possible, while the truth may be so poorly </p><p>told that it sounds untrue. Or the truth </p><p>may be so unusual or amazing that no skill </p><p>in telling can make it sound true. </p><p> Now what would be the good of giving</p><p>our readers true stories that sounded like </p><p>lies? If a story seems utterly absurd to a </p><p>reader, it does, and that’s all there is about </p><p>it, even if it is actually true. A reader sel- </p><p>dom has time, chance or wish to start a </p><p>serious investigation of the magazine stories </p><p>he reads. He reads, passes judgment and </p><p>that’s generally an end of the matter. </p><p>"VTOW consider a story in this very issue—</p><p>“Yahoya.” As the manuscript came </p><p>to us it stated that one of the Hopi Indians </p><p>ran 800 miles in 10 days—80 miles a day. </p><p>It might be true but we knew most of our </p><p>readers would think it a wild exaggeration. </p><p>So, with Mr. Gregory’s consent, we changed </p><p>it to twenty days, 40 miles a day—cut it </p><p>square in two. Yet even so some of you </p><p>may have written it down as a bad break </p><p>and wholly impossible. We made similar </p><p>changes elsewhere in the tale. Mr. </p><p>Gregory’s letter follows: </p><p> I agree with you in the matter of toning down the</p><p>startling matter in the endurance racing. I put the </p><p>stuff in because it’s the truth; because I believe it; </p><p>because when you speak of Hopi you speak of an </p><p>animal that is as different from the Bahana as is a </p><p>wolf from a French poodle. Those le;in-bodied devils </p><p>can do the thing I have told of them; they were </p><p>builded for it by the desert. But, when all is said </p><p>and done, I have given you a story and the less it </p><p>strains credulity upon non-essential points, the better </p><p>it is going to pan out. Will you cut down the num- </p><p>ber of miles yourself? Or do you want me to do it? </p><p> And here are two notes that accompanied</p><p>the original manuscript: </p><p> In connection with the endurance and swiftness</p><p>of the Southwestern Indian the following fact, well </p><p>known to thousands of white men who know these </p><p>strange people, may be cited: The men of Oraibi </p><p>will run out across the hot desert sands a distance of </p><p>40 miles, do a day’s work there in their corn-fields, </p><p>and run back the same day to Oraibi! </p><p> See also George Wharton James’s, “The Indians</p><p>of the Painted Desert,” p. 91: “One Oraibi, Ku-wa- </p><p>wen-ti-wa, ran from Oraibi to Moenkopi, thence to </p><p>Walpi and back to Oraibi, a distance of over 90 </p><p>miles, in one day.” _ </p><p>HERE is a pungent little acrostic for </p><p>National Defense, sent in by Clarence </p><p>W. Hamilton of Franklin, Ohio. It’s the </p><p>surest way to spell Peace: Prepare! Else </p><p>America Can’t Exist. </p><p>WHO knows whether any concessions </p><p>have been granted in respect to </p><p>these two South American lakes reported </p><p>to contain a vast treasure? </p><p>Daytona, Fla. </p><p> As a mining engineer, and more or less an adven-</p><p>turer, I read with special interest the stories of “Lost </p><p>Treasures of the World.” I was particularly struck </p><p>with the physical conditions described in the case </p><p>of the treasure of I’ozo de Donto, and also the Sa- </p><p>cred Lake of the Chibchas. </p><p>J HAVE had occasion more than once, in an- </p><p>other part of the world, to desire to lift the </p><p>“wash,” containing tin and gold, from the bottom of </p><p>a swamp or small lake, such as is described in the </p><p>cases above. I could not afford much money for </p><p>lant, and few men were available and wages very </p><p>igh. I thought the matter out, and tried many </p><p>experiments, and at last arrived at a solution of the </p><p>218 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>difficulty. I got out the tin all right, and it cost </p><p>me very little more than mining under more favor- </p><p>able conditions. The method was novel,'and neither </p><p>before or since have I seen it adopted. It would be </p><p>the ideal method to employ in the case of these </p><p>treasure lakes, and is thoroughly applicable to them, </p><p>if the rough description given is even approximately </p><p>correct. </p><p>(~]AN you tell me if any concession is held over </p><p>either or both these lakes at the present time? </p><p>And if so, how can I get in touch with the owners? </p><p>I would iike to suggest to those interested (for a </p><p>consideration of course, if my methods were adopt- </p><p>ed) a certain and cheap method of solving the dif- </p><p>ficulty. </p><p> If they are not so held I should like to know, for</p><p>in that case I should go and look over the ground, </p><p>and if they are as described, then form an adven- </p><p>ture party, adopt my dodge, and—prove if those </p><p>$600,000,000 are really awaiting the adventurer.— </p><p>R. Purdue. _ </p><p>T&gt;Y CAMP-FIRE custom Roy P. Church- </p><p>ill rises and introduces himself on the </p><p>occasion of the first story he gives us: </p><p> A lot of the people in the United States have no</p><p>idea at all, or at least a very limited one, of the </p><p>Navy. They know we have one, but what the ships </p><p>do and how the men live is a closed book to them. </p><p>My excuse for pestering the editors with Navy </p><p>stories is to tell about the Navy and let some of the </p><p>people on the “Outside” know how the boys on the </p><p>“Inside” live and love and play and fight. </p><p>T ENLISTED from an inland town, in Kentucky </p><p> to be exact, as a landsman for training and was</p><p>paid off with a “big ticket” as a boatswain’s mate. </p><p>The experiences I had and the yarns I heard form </p><p>the basis for the stories. Some of my shipmates in </p><p>the South Atlantic may recognize themselves or </p><p>their friends and I wonder if somebody will pick up </p><p>this copy of Adventure and remember the forty-day </p><p>trip the windjammer Alliance made from Hampton </p><p>Roads to Plymouth. </p><p> The idea for “Hereditary Evidence” came from</p><p>an experience while on furlough, and a train wreck in </p><p>California, where I now live. I thought it would </p><p>be unusual and interesting thus to combine the land </p><p>and sea.	_</p><p>PUBLISHING a story laid 3,300 years </p><p>ago is something new for this magazine. </p><p>Personally I like stories of the past, but I </p><p>realized many of you do not and when Mr. </p><p>Bishop, then a stranger to me, came in to </p><p>talk over in advance “In the Grip of the </p><p>Minotaur,” laid about 1400 B. c., I sort of </p><p>shied away from it. Also I feared he and </p><p>Dr. Brodeur knew too much about arche- </p><p>ology and ancient history to write a fiction </p><p>tale without spoiling its story with too much </p><p>lugged-in information. </p><p> But I took a chance and I’m glad I did.</p><p>I don’t think any one can accuse the authors </p><p>of parading the knowledge they undoubt- </p><p>edly have or of failing to say their say sim- </p><p>ply and clearly. It’s a man’s story, told by </p><p>men. And, to me at least, it’s a very real </p><p>world its characters move in. </p><p>AS TO Crete’s wonderfully developed </p><p>civilization in that distant day I think </p><p>you will find the story’s local color true and </p><p>in accord with the latest findings of scien- </p><p>tific investigation and theory. Any of </p><p>you who can visit the famous Cretan col- </p><p>lection in the Metropolitan Museum of </p><p>Art in this city can verify quite a good </p><p>deal of it. </p><p> In accordance with Camp-Fire custom,</p><p>here is a word of introduction from Mr. </p><p>Bishop, speaking for both authors. (Inci- </p><p>dentally it was written when Mr. Bishop </p><p>was enlisting in the First Armored Motor </p><p>Battery, N. G. N. Y., a pioneer in that </p><p>branch of national preparedness.) </p><p> In reply to your letter asking for the titles of the</p><p>“scientific books” Dr. Brodeur and myself have </p><p>written, I would beg to state that there ain’t no sich </p><p>animiles. To be sure, Dr. Brodeur has translated </p><p>the Younger Edda into English for the Scandi- </p><p>navian-American Society. I have written “Panama </p><p>Past and Present,” “The Story of the Submarine,” </p><p>and several magazine articles on the Panama Canal. </p><p>Both of us have had a long training in historical re- </p><p>search, and a perverted taste for digging up queer </p><p>things out of the past. </p><p>pAST and present, like East and West, have the </p><p>same fascinating resemblances and differences, </p><p>whatever times and places you visit. There is a </p><p>certain village in England where men have been </p><p>chipping flints since the old Stone Age; first for </p><p>spear-heads, then for striking fire, then for flint-</p><p>locks, enough of which were traded into Africa to </p><p>keep half a dozen aged “flint-nappers” busy down </p><p>to the outbreak of the Great War. Then the whole </p><p>village went back to the old trade, for many soldiers </p><p>in the trenches are lighting their cigarettes with </p><p>flint and steel (Grant lit his cigars that way in the </p><p>Civil War), instead of matches. Compared to that, </p><p>what is a little thing like sanitary plumbing in </p><p>1400 b. c.? </p><p>'T'HE story of Atlantis was first set down by He- </p><p>rodotus, the Father of History, whom the </p><p>Egyptian priests told of the vanished glories of a </p><p>great island in the midst of the sea, from which </p><p>ships traded with Egypt till the island disappeared </p><p>beneath the waves. To the Greeks of Herodotus’s </p><p>time (about 430 b. c.), the sea meant the great ocean </p><p>beyond the Pillars of Hercules; so they placed the </p><p>lost island there. But to the Egyptians of a thou- </p><p>sand years before, the sea meant the Mediterranean. </p><p>We know that there existed on the island of Crete, </p><p>in the midst of the eastern end of that sea, a great </p><p>maritime civilization, which traded with Egypt for </p><p>many centuries, and came to an abrupt and catastro- </p><p>phic end about 1400 or 1350 b. c. What is more </p><p>natural than the growth of a legend, during the next </p><p>The Camp-Fire	219</p><p>thousand years, in which the cessation of all news </p><p>from the island was explained by its disappearance </p><p>beneath the sea? </p><p> This theory was first advanced in an unsigned</p><p>letter to a London newspaper in 1906, and is now </p><p>accepted by many scholars, though we must wait </p><p>for more evidence before we can say that it is either </p><p>proved or disproved. It is the simplest and most </p><p>plausible solution of the Atlantis mystery, and calls </p><p>for no such tremendous convulsion of Nature as the </p><p>submergence of a large island or small continent. </p><p>Trying to account for the disappearance of Atlantis </p><p>is, in the present state of our knowledge, exactly </p><p>like trying to account for the disappearance of the </p><p>crew of the Marie Cilesle. </p><p>TN ASCRIBING the fall of Knossos to raiders </p><p> from the North, Dr. Brodeur and I were simply</p><p>“plot-building.” My partner knows his Norsemen </p><p>—he reads sagas in the original Icelandic and could </p><p>work his passage on a viking ship—and he was </p><p>searching for some spot untouched by Rider Hag- </p><p>gard for his heroes to raid, when I mentioned </p><p>Minoan Crete. That was too early for vikings, but </p><p>not for the peaceful but by no means pacifist traders </p><p>who preceded them. </p><p> As for our own adventures; we haven’t had any.</p><p>Both of us have led mild and peaceful middle-class </p><p>lives. We roomed together at Harvard. </p><p>HERE is an interesting chapter from an </p><p>adventurer’s life—a look-in for stay- </p><p>at-homes at the kind of things that are </p><p>happening away from the dull lines of rou- </p><p>tine in settled communities. </p><p> I am not a writer by all means, but a reader of</p><p>your magazine ever since I came to the States. Will </p><p>quote briefly: Bom in the Highlands of Bavaria, </p><p>Germany, southern part, in 1887. Went to sea at </p><p>the age of 12 years, and you can take it from me I </p><p>had experiences and adventures of all sorts. Will </p><p>recount some of'them possibly to you later. Saw </p><p>in your Camp-Fire an article asking about informa- </p><p>tion concerning how your magazine was obtained </p><p>in out-of-the-way places. If interesting to you, will </p><p>recount it. By the way, tell you this only to keep </p><p>my mind busy and away from my present plight, </p><p>as I am down to my last dollar again. Well, here </p><p>she goes: </p><p>TT MUST have been in 1907 or ’08 that, while </p><p>wandering down South Street, I chanced upon </p><p>an old shipmate of mine. Same was mate, or</p><p>rather second mate and acting bos’un, on a handy </p><p>little three-sticker (a fore-and-after). Decided to </p><p>join him on the trip. We were bound to West In- </p><p>dies and Central American ports with a general </p><p>cargo. Outward bound, nothing happened. The </p><p>vessel had very good qualities, a fast sailer, and the </p><p>skipper an exceptionally hard driver. There were </p><p>only three men in the forecastle, myself included. </p><p>MOW, owing to harsh and unjust treatment, re- </p><p>ceived from the hands of German sailors dur- </p><p>ing three years of apprenticeship, I simply never </p><p>can take to any of them kindly. But one of these </p><p>seemed to be excepted. He came from the north- </p><p>ern part of Germany, somewhere up in Pomerania. </p><p>He was of good family and seemed to be an alto- </p><p>gether different fellow from the rest that I had to </p><p>deal with before. To make my yam shorter, we be- </p><p>came good mates, always recounting stories and </p><p>happenings from the old country. </p><p> He was pretty green as far as seamanship was</p><p>concerned, never having been on any sailing vessel, </p><p>but I helped him out whenever possible and he soon </p><p>was doing very well indeed. In fact, too well, as </p><p>all of a sudden he fell victim to that terrible sick- </p><p>ness called swelled-head, and became quite a person- </p><p>age. But he never said boo when it came to reef- </p><p>ing or making fast topsails in a squall. After his </p><p>first attack I left him all to himself, and even re- </p><p>pulsed his later advances, as I now classed him with </p><p>the rest of the roundheads. </p><p>AA/Ti CAME to Puerto Cortez (Spanish Hondu- </p><p>ras) Christmas evening. The old man ad- </p><p>vanced us a couple of dollars. We rowed ashore to </p><p>celebrate in a dive run by a Frenchman. We got </p><p>hilarious and you know how it is when you have a </p><p>grudge against some one. Sooner or later it will out, </p><p>and wine in a tropical country sets you simply boil- </p><p>ing. Don’t know if it was a girl of that dive started </p><p>us off or what. Come to think now, it was some </p><p>brown Venus. He claimed that she favored him </p><p>better than me and we fools spent our $10 a mile a </p><p>minute, just to please her, and got thrown out </p><p>when we were broke. </p><p> Outside, we renewed the argument. He being a</p><p>strong young man and I much smaller in propor- </p><p>tion, he thought to do away quickly with me. But </p><p>he found out different. I found I had to finish him </p><p>quickly and accordingly put all my strength and </p><p>energy in the assault and attacked him with a feroc- </p><p>ity that he had not expected. His style was that </p><p>of the wrestler, mine both wrestling and boxing. </p><p>T\TOW mind, at the time, the country down there</p><p>was in a revolutionary state and martial law </p><p>was pronounced in Puerto Cortez. When I laid him </p><p>out with a right-arm-swing to the jaw, my senses </p><p>cleared and I thought I had killed the man. I did </p><p>not have much time to find out, either, as a bunch </p><p>of native soldiers laid hold of me and we went in </p><p>the direction of the main part of the town. Then </p><p>realization came quick, and all the remorseful </p><p>thoughts of my action with it. I decided to escape </p><p>if possible. </p><p> How I got away, and how I got back to the ves-</p><p>sel and away again, and how I had to hide from the </p><p>soldiers, in the swamps never before penetrated by </p><p>white men, alone would take a book to tell. I real- </p><p>ly don’t know today how long I hid, but found my- </p><p>self fever-crazed one morning on the beach, about </p><p>thirty miles from port. I was literally cut to pieces, </p><p>my whole body was swollen, as mosquitoes there </p><p>abound in real clouds. What a blessing that salt- </p><p>water bath was to me when I dragged myself on all </p><p>fours down to the water’s edge! You can not </p><p>imagine unless you have experienced something like it </p><p>yourself. </p><p>T-TOW I got along and acquainted myself with </p><p>some of the natives would make interesting </p><p>reading. To come back to my subject: Way out in </p><p>the swamps I lived unknown to any, outside of a </p><p>Chinaman and one black fellow. He was a deform- </p><p>ed Hercules, the most hideous being you could </p><p>imagine. He supplied me every month with food </p><p>from the town. We both were partners in the </p><p>220 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>swamps where we gained a precarious existence by </p><p>burning blue mango wood and making charcoal (al- </p><p>most any woman in that country uses same). Also </p><p>gathering palm-kernels, stealing and marauding </p><p>upon plantations (only fruits), which the negro then </p><p>sold in Puerto Cortez to traders and in the public </p><p>market. Never did get much more out of it than </p><p>my grub, as he usually came home drunk, half of </p><p>the goods lost or stolen, and in a very bad frame of </p><p>mind. On those occasions had to defend myself for </p><p>life at times. </p><p> Went almost crazy with the heat, then the rainy</p><p>weather arrived, and I got spells of fever again. The </p><p>only medicine I had was a grass which grows there, </p><p>of a sour taste, has very long leaves, and is used to </p><p>make tea for those stricken with fever. </p><p>QME day, during Grant’s absence (he called </p><p>himself Grant), I decided to do something— </p><p>get some books, at least, as I could endure it no long- </p><p>er to lay in our Mannaka shack day and night— </p><p>think and think. Got out to the beach (we were </p><p>camped some miles away, in the forest swamp), and </p><p>made my way along the same slowly. Came across </p><p>some natives (same are mostly mixed breeds, In- </p><p>dians, blacks, Spanish and Chinese), who gave me </p><p>a willing ride in their canoe for the day. They </p><p>camped at night somewhere along the beach, and </p><p>next morning I left them to make my way by boat, </p><p>as they told me there was a ranch run by an Amer- </p><p>ican not far distant. When I got there, I asked for </p><p>reading matter, and especially for my old friend, Ad- </p><p>venture. Imagine my chagrin when I could not get </p><p>a single copy of the same. </p><p>NTOWI have told you my yam. I don’t know if you </p><p>like same. It’s somewhat arduous and incom- </p><p>plete, and not what you asked for, only the reverse. </p><p>I went out for magazines, in my mind especially </p><p>the Adventure in the foreground, and got very much </p><p>disappointed. How I fared after I left the ranch </p><p>is still another story, too long to recount at present. </p><p>If you care to hear some more at another time, and </p><p>are able to read my bad English, I am always at </p><p>your disposition. For the present I am yours,— </p><p>Sam Tuer. </p><p>MOST of you will see at once that “The </p><p>Receipt” by S. B. H. Hurst in this </p><p>issue is a sequel to “The Marrow-Bone” </p><p>published early in this year. </p><p>I’M GLAD to republish here the follow- </p><p>ing from “Privates’ Manual,” by Cap-</p><p>tain Jas.

Co., Menasha, Wis.), </p><p>which includes “Field Service,” “Officers’ </p><p>Manual,” “Non-Commissioned Officers’ </p><p>Manual,” “Manual of Military Training,” </p><p>“Applied Minor Tactics,” “Militia Field </p><p>Manual,” “Field Sanitation,” “A Working </p><p>Knowledge of Spanish” and “Elements of </p><p>Modern Field Artillery.” “Self-Helps for </p><p>the Citizen-Soldier” has already been men- </p><p>tioned in Camp-Fire. </p><p>THE PATRIOT’S MILITARY CREED </p><p>T BELIEVE in Peace, but in Peace with Honor and </p><p> Self-Respect.</p><p>T BELIEVE that War is a terrible thing that </p><p>should be avoided, if possible, but I also believe </p><p>that there are things in this world worse than War, </p><p>and Peace without Honor and Self-Respect is one of </p><p>them. </p><p>J BELIEVE in what the Flag of my Country </p><p>stands for—Honor, Justice, Truth, Civilization, </p><p>Democracy, Liberty, Humanity. </p><p>T BELIEVE it the duty of every American to up- </p><p>hold the Flag and what it stands for, and I be- </p><p>lieve it the duty of every able-bodied American </p><p>to prepare himself in a Military way for this Re- </p><p>sponsibility. </p><p>T BELIEVE in Personal Preparedness, by which </p><p>I mean if I am ever needed to defend my Sis- </p><p>ter, my Mother, my Home, and my Country, I will </p><p>be Prepared to do so. </p><p>T BELIEVE in National Preparedness, by whicfi </p><p>I mean my Country being Prepared to up- </p><p>hold what the Flag stands for and to defend itself if </p><p>attacked. </p><p>T BELIEVE that Citizenship carries with it Ob- </p><p>ligations as well as Privileges, and I believe </p><p>that Military Service is one of the most important </p><p>of these Obligations. </p><p>T BELIEVE in the benefits of Military Train- </p><p>ing; I believe that it strengthens the body, </p><p>benefits the health, improves the mind and teaches </p><p>obedience, respect for law and order, patriotism, </p><p>courtesy, honor, loyalty, manliness, cleanliness, </p><p>thoroughness, system, organization and team-work. </p><p>In short, I believe in Military Training because it </p><p>makes for Efficiency and better Citizenship. </p><p>HERE’S an old friend we haven’t heard </p><p>from for two years, and he reports </p><p>something that will be of particular inter- </p><p>est to those of you who knew the old West. </p><p>The omitted part of his letter was devoted </p><p>to “roasting” one of our recent novelettes, </p><p>but knocks, like boosts, we try to keep out of </p><p>“Camp - Fire.” The Indian words Mr. </p><p>Huston speaks of, were referred, as he sug- </p><p>gested, to Mr. C. L. Gilman, but the latter </p><p>claims little knowledge of the Ojibway lan- </p><p>guage. </p><p>Camp in the Mountains back of St. Helena, Calif. </p><p> Jan. is, 1916.</p><p> Still here (just knocked wood) but getting older</p><p>and weaker. A ten-mile line of twenty traps is </p><p>hard for me now, but the spirit is yet strong. </p><p> Itjis snowing like-where there is no snow. My</p><p>stove smokes, as does my lantern, and the green </p><p>pelts stink like, well, there is no comparison, they </p><p>simply stink. However, my colt comes up, unlooses </p><p>the tent-flap and tries to come in a dozen times in </p><p>the twenty-four hours; then my dog preempts my </p><p>bed and I squat on my heels like a gugu. </p><p>The Camp-Fire </p><p>221 </p><p>CINCE I wrote you two years ago I have lost </p><p>the sight of one eye and have to shoot wholly </p><p>right-handed now. ... (is that spelt O. K.) </p><p>and by the way O.' K. is ar an or am, two </p><p>Indian words meaning “quite so,” “precisely,” </p><p>“sure,” “all right.” Get Gilman to look this up </p><p>among the ’Jibways near him, but I think it’s Osage </p><p>or Pawnee. </p><p> I hope the author does not make a mess of Bill</p><p>Hickock [“Wild Bill”]or Hikox as some spell it. I </p><p>knew him before his death, he was with Berdan’s </p><p>Sharpshooters with my cousin California Joe (Joe </p><p>Huston), both “Damyanks,” but Hikox was the </p><p>younger man. </p><p>NJOW here is a tip for you. A few years ago I </p><p>walked a beat for the ——and one of the offi- </p><p>cers of the same was a man I had seen and known </p><p>slightly in “Missouroh” years ago. I recognized </p><p>him and he me, but neither said anything then. </p><p>When I quit, he gave me the high sign and promised </p><p>me rapid advancement, etc., if I would stay, but I </p><p>did not like the yaps and squareheads he had on his </p><p>rolls. </p><p>A YEAR or so later his wife shot him (killed him) </p><p>1 and told who he was, but very few believed </p><p>that what she charged was the truth, yet it was </p><p>God’s own solemn truth. I do not know the story, </p><p>but have an inkling. After Crittenden pardoned </p><p>him for shooting Jesse James and he was shot and </p><p>reported killed, he recovered and, knowing he was a </p><p>marked man, he came to California and, as a reward </p><p>for guarding Otis, was started in business. Yes, </p><p>Bob Ford and no other. Sure? Of course I’m sure. </p><p>I know. And Evans or Sontag or any of the Daltons </p><p>yet alive could verify it if they would. </p><p> Only one mail every three months.</p><p> Good luck to you.

Of course the Adven- </p><p>turers’ Club, with its various chapters, is al- </p><p>ready in the field, but perhaps there is need </p><p>and place for a more general order. If such </p><p>a society were started it should not, I think, </p><p>use the word “Camp-Fire,” not only be- </p><p>cause our Camp-Fire already exists, but be- </p><p>cause if it were definitely organized with</p><p>badges bearing the name, the proposed </p><p>brotherhood would by many be considered </p><p>merely a circulation scheme for this mag- </p><p>azine. Also, there is a local organization </p><p>in New York City called the Camp-Fire </p><p>222 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Club, having no connection with this mag- </p><p>azine. </p><p> If the idea appeals to you, write to Mr.</p><p>Garvey and talk it over. It looks to me like </p><p>a splendid idea. </p><p> The other night whilst sitting in my room, pon-</p><p>dering over an old number of Adventure, I began </p><p>to wonder how many more lonely souls there were </p><p>that night whose thoughts ran like mine, on what </p><p>might have been, and what had been. Of men who </p><p>write in the Camp-Fire and men who are more or </p><p>less eaten up by the Wanderlust and who have seen </p><p>both sides of life. The more I studied over this </p><p>thought, the more I became convinced that, many </p><p>such men who are now unknown to each other </p><p>could, by some symbol, be made aware of the </p><p>kindred nature of the other and probably find enjoy- </p><p>ment and solace in each other’s company. </p><p>'T'HEN arose the thought: Why not a Brother- </p><p>hood of some description? Possibly an “Order </p><p>of the Camp-Fire,” with a specified emblem, and </p><p>members that pledge themselves to obey the rules, </p><p>which should be such that any man (and I mean a </p><p>puin), could live up to. </p><p>• I sincerely believe that some such order might </p><p>prove beneficial in many ways to some of the boys </p><p>who must forever search new ways and trails, and I </p><p>believe, if such a thing should be born, that its </p><p>emblems would be seen in all phases of life in all </p><p>countries before very long. </p><p> That’s only my idea. If you think it’s at all</p><p>feasible, put it up to the bunch and find out what </p><p>they think about it. </p><p> I believe we could soon have a very strong order</p><p>of men who would find it possible to help each other </p><p>in many, many ways.—Jno. J. Garvey, The Cross- </p><p>ing Rooms, 3 Main St., Akron, 0. </p><p>A ND here, from another man, then in </p><p> Mexico, comes the same suggestion:</p><p> It has been over a year since I have bothered you</p><p>with a letter, so I believe I am entitled to another </p><p>chance. </p><p> I must tell you of an incident which happened in</p><p>Mexico some time ago. I was riding pretty fast for </p><p>the nearest town I could find, as I had been out of </p><p>grub for a day and a half, and I was a hungry hombre.</p><p>My horse stepped into a dog-hole, breaking his leg. </p><p>I shot the poor devil, and started to foot it. Still </p><p>toward town, as my stomach was about ready to </p><p>sue me for non-support. Before I started, I had </p><p>cached my saddle and pack the best I could. </p><p>T HAD been walking about two hours when I </p><p>saw the smoke of an engine. I headed that </p><p>way and found it was a freight. I flagged it down, </p><p>walked to the caboose, and took a good American </p><p>sassing for being a good-for-nothing cow-puncher </p><p>bumming a ride. Anyway, this said hombre invited </p><p>me into the caboose, cooked me up one meal, and </p><p>then another one. He and two Mexicans were the </p><p>crew. After he had seen me putting that grub away, </p><p>he said he would take that back about me being </p><p>good for nothing, as I sure could eat. </p><p> We both rolled a cigarette, when I saw a copy</p><p>of Adventure under the bench. I asked him who it </p><p>belonged to. He said he had been reading it ever </p><p>since it first came out. I showed him my identifica- </p><p>tion-card. Then we shook hands; we were brothers </p><p>of the Camp-Fire. I told him about my saddle and </p><p>pack. He stopped the train while the Greasers got </p><p>it for me. </p><p>HTHERE is where the idea hit me. Why not </p><p>organize the Camp-Fire? Make it a body of </p><p>its own. Can you imagine what the two of us meet- </p><p>ing in such a strange manner had to talk about? </p><p>Why the Camp-Fire, of course. Think it over, old </p><p>timer. </p><p> He and I stayed together for one week in Arizona.</p><p>I had two letters from him, but, the last time I </p><p>wrote, the letter was returned unopened. I am try- </p><p>ing to find out his whereabouts. </p><p>J STAYED around the State of Arizona for a </p><p>while, then went over into New Mexico. Was </p><p>in Columbus three days before the Villa raid. I </p><p>tried to get back in time to see the Willard-Moran </p><p>fight but couldn’t make it. I’m back home now, </p><p>taking in the big sights. I ran across Adventure in </p><p>many strange places. I will tell you maybe some </p><p>time again. As this is enough for another year. </p><p> Hoping you will think over what I said regarding</p><p>Camp-Fire.—Id.1927. </p><p>INFORMATION DIRECTORY </p><p> IMPORTANT: Only items like those below can be</p><p>printed—standing sources of Information.
