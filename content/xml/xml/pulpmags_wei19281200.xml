            <seg type="columnLine">down an innumerable number of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">direction; then, suddenly, twisted off</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">into another. He soon lost all sense</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of direction, and followed blindly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">after his hurrying guide. Once he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stumbled over something that lay</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in his path, and only his tight clutch</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on the other's girdle kept him from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">falling. He lost his hold on his bag,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and heard a dull splash, as if it had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fallen into water. He tried to stoop</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to recover it, but his silent guide did</seg>
