Seeing Sheriff Barton Keller</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing between the law office and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the store, and the Noren boys and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick Foster on the saloon veranda,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ed Spooner beside his horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he'd stepped down at the res-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taurant hitchrack, you would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done a double-take on them, for you</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't have believed that so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">people could be there without any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them making any kind of a sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I said what do you think of that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The liveryman muttered grudging-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, "I don't think nothing of it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, maybe you'll think some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of it when I fort up in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinking stable and shoot it out with</seg><seg type="columnLine">all them big, tough Rangers. Because</seg><seg type="columnLine">right now that's what I'm thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">of doing, old man. And then not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">my horse but all your horses too</seg><seg type="columnLine">would get my attention, because like</seg><seg type="columnLine">as not I'd fort right up behind them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because them big, tough Rangers</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't want to mow down all them</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty ponies to get at me, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way I could be mowing the Ranger</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys down instead while they made</seg><seg type="columnLine">up their minds."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Charlie Landry put his pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes on the group on the saloon</seg><seg type="columnLine">porch. He might have been a good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking kid except for those color-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less eyes, though it was hard to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">any more whether their cold, dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">look was a result of a lack of pig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentation or lack of any shred of</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmth behind them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was difficult, in fact, to note</seg><seg type="columnLine">much less remember any other detail</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Charlie Landry's face than his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. They were him; they and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning-fast gunhand. They seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get bigger if you could stand to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look straight into them, until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascinated you, hypnotized you. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">Landry's flashy attire, even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jewel-studded black flat-crowned</seg><seg type="columnLine">stetson, and the purple silk shirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fancy white embroidery on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the two breast pockets, did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the impression on you that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are the quiet little boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">lined up on the veranda there?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charlie Landry said. Then one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his .45's was suddenly glinting in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right hand and he was blistering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon with bullets, so that the Noren</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys and Dick Foster had all they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do to dive onto the planking</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time to escape the fusillade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're yellow little boys, I see,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charlie Landry said, deliberately</seg><seg type="columnLine">reloading his gun. "Which is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff?" he said a moment later.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You, fella?" he addressed Barton</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keller.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lawman stood as though fro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zen, his eyes wide on Landry, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands flat on his belly, moving un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortably, as though he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what to do with them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey, here come them Rangers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man," said amiably then to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hostler, for the gentle thud of hoofs</seg><seg type="columnLine">had begun to sound on the still night</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. "Dry night like tonight, sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't carryin' far, so they'll be cornin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">in right quick, right, old man?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE HOSTLER, having been</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing stiff, suddenly grabbed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shotgun from behind a doorpost and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was squeezing the triggers before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the weapon lined. This was why</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had little success, but it was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time the only reason he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">any success at all. Charlie Landry</seg><seg type="columnLine">had expected such a move, but Char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie Landry didn't blow the top of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man's head off in a hurried man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner. There were times you needed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be fast; putting it on an old man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not one of them. That was how-come</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charlie Landry's left arm got</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushed by the shotgun blast. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">timed his draw for a split-second</seg><seg type="columnLine">later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damn you!" he snarled, feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slugs rip his arm, the first taste</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charlie Landry had ever had of hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead, and in unleashed fury he emp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied his gun into the already dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, from which life had been torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his first bullet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sheriff Barton Keller went for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun then, stepping out onto the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boardwalk, but the Rangers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweeping into town in this same</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, and Charlie Landry had</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WILD TIME</seg><seg type="columnLine">11</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheeled his horses viciously and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung off and into the cover of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">livery. He ripped off his left sleeve</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when he saw all the bleeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">holes he swore violently again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slammed his empty gun at the crum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pled form of the hostler.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Charlie Landry's bloodshot</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale eyes flicked wildly in the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the Rangers, who were step-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping down in front of the livery with</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn guns amid the yelling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing of townsmen, and Charlie</seg><seg type="columnLine">Landry palmed his left-side gun and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as promised, started yanking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses out of their stalls so that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">became a multi-layered barricade</seg><seg type="columnLine">between him and the Rangers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The horses remained an adjunct to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charlie Landry's stand but briefly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, Landry's near-hysteria evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently spread to the animals, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the excitement outside rose as well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they started moving. One, in fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly reared, and one of its paw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hooves caught Landry's already</seg><seg type="columnLine">tortured left shoulder. Charlie Lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry's profanity was purple at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he wasted another bullet by</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashing it at the horse's head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Which only served to compound</seg><seg type="columnLine">his difficulties, because the animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed before it died, and the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses really started getting out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bullets, indeed, that the light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning-fast young gunman used on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old liveryman and the horses became,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ironically, the only effective ones he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got in during this his greatest show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. For the stampeding horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused him to have to abandon shoot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the Rangers in the street, sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">him desperately to the rear door o£</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And by the time he got the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">yanked open, four Rangers had sped</seg><seg type="columnLine">back there between the livery and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next building, and were waiting with</seg><seg type="columnLine">lined and levered sixguns and .30-30s'.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So that Charlie Landry was literally</seg><seg type="columnLine">blown to hell before his fabulous</seg><seg type="columnLine">trigger-finger could react even in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinctively. ...</seg><seg type="columnLine">SOMETIMES Ed Spooner not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">put his head on one side when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured his coffee from his cup into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his saucer, but also arched the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger of his pouring hand. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">this on very special occasions. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">it this morning at breakfast with Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Foster and Dick.

It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">year now since he'd seen Rodri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guez. ..</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he swung down in the yard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorn found the Mexican waiting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">greet him. Rodriguez has aged, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">preacher thought when they shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands; his round face, though smil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, looked tired and careworn. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dig no longer for the silver," the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man said presently, as they sat remi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">niscing. "Maybe soon I go back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sonora.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And leave the mine?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rodriguez nodded, "It is sad, Se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor."

"It is not money I need, Senor,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked down at his gnarled brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, raised them painfully, "A man</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot dig with his hands full of mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery.

"Dry,'' he muttered, wondering-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. In all his years meandering up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the Territory, he couldn't re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">call when mountain water hadn't kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Rio Gato full and running. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thing he'd taken for granted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorft wheeled his horse and jogged</seg><seg type="columnLine">up-river, reflecting on the will of</seg><seg type="columnLine">God. Rodriguez giving up his mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">because it flooded with water--while</seg><seg type="columnLine">here the Rio Gato ran dry and ranch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers in the valley faced ruin. Which-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever way a man rode, there was trou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He prodded the mare to a faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace along the trail. This trouble was</seg><seg type="columnLine">man-made, it occurred to him now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes scanned the burned river</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom; there'd been enough rain in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hills, according to Rodriguez.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, coming to a clearing, he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall of rough-hewn timbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretching soVidly from bank to bank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and beyond, the flash of sun-lit wat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er. So the Rio Gato had been damned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he suspected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went on past the clearing. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">backwater from the dam had risen</seg><seg type="columnLine">flooding the trail; he took to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush, and rode around it. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short time later as the mare rounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bend in the river, that Dorn, peer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ahead, saw the woman standing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In her hands she held a rifle, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he came close, she put it down. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">preacher tufned into the yard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reining up, said softly, "You won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">need that Winchester, Ma'am. Surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">you remember the riding minister."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Dorn." The woman was young</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she smiled. "It's been quite a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while since you came this way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Preacher."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorn looked down at her. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight-backed and slender in a ging-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham dress, her chestnut hair drawn to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nape of her neck, glinting golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sunlight. But it was the fine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide set of her face, the preacher re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flected, that would make any man re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member. .. "Sorry to hear about your</seg><seg type="columnLine">husband," he said presently. "Johan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son was a good man, and God-loving."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman's glance swept the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished cabin, the bare yard with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of broken fencing. "John did</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he could to build a homestead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It'd take a gunslick to hold out</seg><seg type="columnLine">against Miles Gruber, once he start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed land-grabbing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorn eyed the Winchester. "Is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">why you're holding the rifle?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This place stands in the way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miles' plans for his diversion dam,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the widow said bitterly.

He peered</seg><seg type="columnLine">yonder at the hollow slope of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills, and remembering the backwater</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the trail, said, "Now he wants your</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, to flood with backwater."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The widow nodded. "My husband</seg><seg type="columnLine">died in the brush with a bullet in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, over a year ago.

Gruber doesn't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what love is," she said, coloring. Late-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, he's started threatening me--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hoof-tromp sounded in the yard, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she added, morosely, "Here he is</seg><seg type="columnLine">now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorn looked up to see Gruber rid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing toward them; he turned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">widow. "If you don't mind, Ma'am,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll give the mare some water." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung from saddle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">GRUBER REINED up beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">widow and swept off his hat with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flourish. "Fine day."

"What are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorn said, softly, "It's time you</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped bothering Mrs. Johanson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gruber."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gruber sat the saddle, a big man</seg><seg type="columnLine">and florid, his face grown suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">livid with anger. He glanced at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">widow, then back at the man beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. "Why, you damned tramp par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son," he roared, "I'll have you run out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the country!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wheeled his horse dangerously</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the widow Johanson. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't expect you'd have company,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ma'am," he said angrily. "I'll be back</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow. One of these days you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">think better of my offer." Spurring</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gelding, he galloped from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The widow stood looking after him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Despair in her eyes, she turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">face the preacher. "Gruber means I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">sell, or be flooded out," she said. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">backwater from his dam is rising. .."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorn let his horse drink from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pail.

"You</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't rightly belong here, Preachfy."</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said respectfully. "I ain't marryin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beth--my place is wiped out." His</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice shook with emotion, "Leave us</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, we'll settle with Gruber."</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a rumble of agreement</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ranchers and the meeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered, men pushing past the</seg><seg type="columnLine">preacher toward the doorway. "Meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of the hotel before daylight,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red-haired man called, "We'll ride</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Box-G and give Gruber a surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">party."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE WAS nothing he could do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorn thought grimly, as later, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat staring from .the window of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">room at the hotel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Main Street was still ablaze with</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamplight. A crowd of people stood in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of the hotel, talking in low tones</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the morning raid on Box-G. Gruber</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be ready; they're waiting, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">preacher thought, waiting for the kill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to begin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He'd placed the lamp on the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mode near his chair, and for a time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to read from the Bible.

Preacher, Johnny Hackett had</seg><seg type="columnLine">16</seg><seg type="columnLine">2-GUN WESTERN</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him; maybe Johnny was right. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning, he'd ride from town.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Down-valley he'd take the medicine to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rodriguez, and go back over the pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Yuma. His fingers moved to close</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Bible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A page had come loose and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked down, meaning to put it back</seg><seg type="columnLine">in place.

The Rio Gato wound</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the hills above Rodriguez's</seg><seg type="columnLine">place--and Rodriguez's mine was</seg><seg type="columnLine">flooding with water. Dorn read the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next verse, his heart pounding;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Behold.. .thou shalt smite the rock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there shall come water out of it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the people may drink. ..</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was all there, in the Bible!</seg><seg type="columnLine">MINUTES later, Dorn came hurry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out of the Mercantile, a paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">bundle in his arms, and called to John-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ny Hackett, who'd just swung down</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of the Empire Saloon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny led his gelding across Main</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street.

His crew was</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread out behind him, except for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few who stood guard on the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank of the narrow river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Box-G's owner smiled. "I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">scare easy," he said to the ranchers</seg><seg type="columnLine">who sat their horses before him. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand hovered above his holster. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to be the first to move, Hanni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The red-head swore. He turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men beside him. "Keep listening</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the preacher here, and you'll all</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn yellow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He couldn't delay any longer, Dorn</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thinking. Maybe he had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the explosion, riding down-valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the ranchers--but he couldn't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure. He'd been too worried about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny's ever reaching Rodriguez,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard-riding with his saddle bsgs</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuffed with dynamite. .. Dorn swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">from saddle and walked toward Gru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop where you are, Preacher,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gruber barked. He'd drawn his gun;</seg><seg type="columnLine">his glance flicked over the ranchers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his will commanding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorn unbuckled his gun-belt and let</seg><seg type="columnLine">it drop to the ground. "I don't think</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll pull the trigger now, Gruber--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that'd be murder." He went forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, until he could see the grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">hairs in Gruber's stubble of beard, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny beads of perspiration that stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his forehead, "Besides, there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">something I want to show you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorn went to the edge of the dam,</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up a stick, and thrust it in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. With his knife he notched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick where it reached the surface. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to Gruber. "The Mexicans call</seg><seg type="columnLine">it Cat River. You know, Gruber, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">never can tell which way a cat'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">jump..." He swung to face the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranchers. "Give me five more minutes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before you start shooting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Out of the way, Preacher," Hanni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan warned. "We're not waitin'--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Time, Dorn thought, minutes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might avert a range war. He turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">again to Gruber, an answer forming as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he spoke. "You thought you had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">river--maybe a whole valley," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed. "It's going to be tough Grub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er, watching your dam go empty."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gruber's solid face worked with</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicion. "You lie, Preacher. But if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've done anything to that river,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you damned, sneaking--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You wouldn't talk like that with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a gun in your hand," Dorn</seg><seg type="columnLine">taunted. Gruber out-weighed him by</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty pounds of solid brawn, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking; Dorn straightened as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rancher dropped his gun-belt to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. Then Gruber was coming to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward him, charging like a maddened</seg><seg type="columnLine">bull, his fists swinging.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorn raised his arms, warding off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the 6avage fury of those first sledge-</seg><seg type="columnLine">"THOU SHALT NOT KILL..."</seg><seg type="columnLine">17</seg><seg type="columnLine">like blows while he waited for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening. When it came he swung a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard right to the side of Gruber's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head; the blow spun Gruber around,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a look of astoniskment on his beefy</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. A growl came from the ranchers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hit him, Preacher," one of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelled lustily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dorn's glance flicked over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horseman; Hannigan sat unmoving.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They'll watch while it lasts, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">preacher thought grimly. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gruber rushed him, and this time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rancher's driven fist struck with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">impact that resounded in his skull</seg><seg type="columnLine">like thunder. Dorn fell sprawling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gruber was upon him in a second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his huge fists pounding, battering him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with blows to the head and shoulders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorn struck back, realizing he fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">a losing battle. But he fought for</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. The sky wheeled crazily be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In desperation, he grasped Gruber</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the arms and, planting a knee in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his belly, heaved upward. Gruber fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">sideways and they grappled, rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ground near the dam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They broke apart and Dorn came up</seg><seg type="columnLine">on one knee, and remained there, try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to clear his vision, when he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gruber coming toward him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rancher kicked viciously at his face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorn grabbed the boot and twisted;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gruber toppled, swearing as he fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tired, Dorn took the moment to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stagger to his feet. Some of his blows</seg><seg type="columnLine">had told on Gruber, he thought with</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction, as the rancher rose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came toward him. There was blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Gruber's cheeks, and his eyes had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the look of murder. "I'm going to kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Preacher," he muttered thickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorn stood still, waiting now for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chance he knew would come--for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gruber in his rage had become reck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less. Even as the rancher swung, Dorn</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped inside the wide arching blow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brought up his fist against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of Gruber's head, with a crack</seg><seg type="columnLine">that resounded in the clearing. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow knocked the heavy man off-bal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance and Gruber was that way, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head back, his jaw out-thrust--when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the preacher's last blow hit him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorn stood for a moment looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at Gruber, hearing only dimly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clamor of voices around him. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he walked to the edge of the dam</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he's left the notched stick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he swung to face the ranchers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a slow smile spreading on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the preacher's face. "You've no reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fight now," he said. "Get Gruber</seg><seg type="columnLine">over here and I'll prove it. .." It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">then that he heard the beat of hoofs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turning, saw Johnny Hackett</seg><seg type="columnLine">come pounding into the clearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Johnny swung down from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lathered gelding and walked ovef to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky-pilot. "You should have seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, Preacher," he said, panting. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">strung that dynamite in the minehead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like you said. When she blew, me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Rodriguez had to run like jack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rabbits to keep from getting drown-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ded.

If he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived to be a hundred, he'd never for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the dumfounded expression on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gruber's face, while water fell away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the notched stick--or the look</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Widow Johanson's eyes as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in her yard, and saw the back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">water from Gruber's dam receding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A fair trip, what with Beth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny Hackett's wedding, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way the Widow Johanson had smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him afterwards, when she'd said</seg><seg type="columnLine">goodbye... "Get along, girl," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">preacher said gruffly.

Long Sam asked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yankee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The kind what I killed me a mess</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rebs with--musket and pistols and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a couple blades forged out of scythes;</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard tell the buffalo grass was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tough and made 'em 'specially to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whack grass."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's they at?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Down in the wagon body."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Haul 'em out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The old woman moaned. "I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to see no Injun fighting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"We don't neither," Pappy said</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly. "But that ain't fixing to help</seg><seg type="columnLine">none if hit comes on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They watched what they had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden in the willows and it was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">AS FAST AS THEY CAME</seg><seg type="columnLine">21</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment or two before Long Sam's</seg><seg type="columnLine">report was verified. The boat shoved</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its covert and headed into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast water. It came swiftly, handled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by two rowers, one an Indian in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern, stripped to his waist and noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing else but a loin cloth; the other in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bow, wearing buckskin and hick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ory. He also wore a hat. At this dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance he seemed more like a white</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a redman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whut's that they got in the boat?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Looks like a mess of wilier</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so it did--long limber willow</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs with the leaves still fresh, cover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a mysterious cargo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's a bullboat, all right, shore as</seg><seg type="columnLine">sour apples," Pappy admitted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A bullboat was a type of canoe not</seg><seg type="columnLine">too often used by Indians. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made by bending a very tough kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wood, hickory, yew if it could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtained, or splint oak, for ribs; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then by running a light tough keel</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the bottom, and the same kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wood around the tops of the ribs</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a gunwale. Over this serviceable</seg><seg type="columnLine">skeleton buffalo hides would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched. When the hides cured over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cedar resin calking, the bullboat</seg><seg type="columnLine">was light, water-tight and swift.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time the canoe had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">within hail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cody," drifted over the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cody hell!" Pappy said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cody friend."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's that half-breed," Long Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "His pappy was a Mormon mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sionary, or something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wouldn't trust the likes of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the life of a dead mule," Pappy</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "You ones come down off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">load."</seg><seg type="columnLine">LONG SAM helped Betty down, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took his time, liking the chore. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">old woman got so flustered her foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped and her fat leg got hung up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sow's crate. She began to yell like</seg><seg type="columnLine">something possessed. "It's chawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">off my leg!" Then she realized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word was indelicate and changed it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Limb."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pappy was calling back to the half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">breed. "Come no nigher, Cody. What's</seg><seg type="columnLine">your business?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cody trade."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cody trade what?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cody trade buffalo meat." He ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured toward the cargo concealed un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the Willow boughs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you trust him, Pappy," Long</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam said. "They's Injuns under them</seg><seg type="columnLine">wilier branches."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whar you get buffalo meat?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hadn't been a buffalo sighted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cody made a gesture toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">headwaters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell your mammy to stop her</seg><seg type="columnLine">squalling, a body can't hear himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuss," Long Sam said to Betty. Mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he was busy. The Yankee had</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid out his rifle, his pistols, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scythe blades.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now hand down that thar front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bedstead," Long Sam said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Yank put that off the load. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman kept yelling. The tread mule</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood the racket as a signal to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause. The boat now was drifting</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the current. Cody and his cargo</seg><seg type="columnLine">were coming nigher. Pappy kept up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">parley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lay down on your belly," Long</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam told Betty. "Know what to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a shootin' arn?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You shoot it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take one yur pappy's pistols. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't waste no lead till we know for</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had got the bedstead between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wagon and the side of the ferry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat. It made a good barricade. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">horseflies and the old woman's squalls</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the hitched mules nervous, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lead team was tugging at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">halters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long Sam took Pappy's rifle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellied alongside Betty until he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight upon Cody and the bullboat un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the bedstead. It wasn't much of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambush, but it was better than none.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't shoot till I give the word."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pappy said. low. "We don't want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">start nothin'.'' After all, the half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">breed might be friendly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was just this element of doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that always made it so dangerous.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Long Sam could have killed either the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian or Cody, but if those willows</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered a half dozen warriors and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their guns, that would only start the</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes lifted and he searched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoreline from whence had come the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullboat. This time there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doul/t It was a typical Indian canoe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">22</seg><seg type="columnLine">2-GUN WESTERN</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it had as many as ten braves in it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ain't no use waiting, Pappy."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I say hain't no use loitering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They's another boat load of 'em wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up the river."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The divil ye say."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long Sam did not wait for the order</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fire. Seconds now were too pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious to waste. He let fly with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting iron that toted a slug the</seg><seg type="columnLine">size of a buckeye, that Pappy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done notable carnage with. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">loaded with a round ball, not like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mine ball, and wadded it with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">double charge of powder. Pappy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked out the logistics of it him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. At the instant of explosion the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft ball mushroomed and filled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrel. When it issued it was twirl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at great speed, and when it hit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it did considerable damage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Pappy emitted a blood-curdling</seg><seg type="columnLine">groan. "You missed him, bub!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Which Long Sam had. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yank, all his battle blood roiled by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfinished fight he'd had with an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy, now had something he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">take out his hate on. His shot knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Indian in the stern into the river.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then up out of the willow wood rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hidden braves. They poured a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly fire into the ferryboat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long Sam saw the bullets splinter</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the bedstead over his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The redskins hadn't had too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to take aim. But they laid out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rear mule and crippled one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead mules, and the beasts plunged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The treadmill brute reared, tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">jump out of his stall, got his leg hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the planks, and plunged about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whinnying piteously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gimme that thar weepin!" Pappy</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He snatched it from his son's hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He reloaded with the skill of an an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient warrior. He knew how to use a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagon for cover. The Yankee knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he was doing, too. He muttered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Been laying all my time to kill me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mess of Injuns."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long Sam was engaged in grabbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bridles of the snorting, plunging</seg><seg type="columnLine">mules and keeping them from drag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging wagon, cargo, old woman and</seg><seg type="columnLine">squealing sow and pigs into the river.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a man's-sized chore. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the bullboat, and the warrior</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe a quarter mile up the river.</seg><seg type="columnLine">HE BULLBOAT was sinking. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians became aware of their di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lemma as the Yank knocked Cody's</seg><seg type="columnLine">brains out. There now were six of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Nothing was left but to swim.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some clung to the boat which, as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they got out of it, still floated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pappy took one neatly through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. The Yank took another neatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same way. You could count 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">off--four now, and they were agitated</seg><seg type="columnLine">like wasps when you stick a flame into</seg><seg type="columnLine">their nest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They hadn't quite figured on this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To them it looked like two old men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an old woman, a young squirt of a boy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a scared girl. Now they were try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to save their guns, unable to shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">now they were in the river, and at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time save their hides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But reinforcements were moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly to their relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Thar they come, Pappy!" Long</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam yelled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A rifle ball whizzed past his ears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Too close to ease his headache. "Lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">low," he told Betty. With ten fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones on hand the redskins might man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age to board the ferryboat. Likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">they figured the junk on the wagon</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth the risk. Some of the trashiest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these emigrants carried gold. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt they had also sighted the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl. Such booty always stirred the</seg><seg type="columnLine">braves to their greatest efforts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No use shooting at the canoe. Long</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam realized. It was a log hollowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out with fire and hatchets. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't sink the thing. Here they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came. Knowing what they were going</seg><seg type="columnLine">up against, the Indians moved des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perately into the task confronting</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Pappy knocked one down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Yank knocked one down. I~ ipv</seg><seg type="columnLine">reloaded and the Yank reloaded and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they let fly and now there were seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">braves capable of fighting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the canoe was only a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">lengths away. The mules were raising</seg><seg type="columnLine">cain. Long Sam reached for the scythe</seg><seg type="columnLine">blade. The redskins were shooting but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it took them time to reload also. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were lying low in the canoe, doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">their chores with apt fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here they come!" Long Sam yelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and the Indians shot their war</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe right up against the ferryboat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strangely enough, the old woman on</seg><seg type="columnLine">AS FAST AS THEY CAME</seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of the feather mattress made no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound. "Dead," Long Sam figured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An Indian grabbed the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat to pull himself aboard, his knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his teeth. Long Sam laid a nice</seg><seg type="columnLine">swish with the scythe blade and cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">off his hand. Betty was shooting</seg><seg type="columnLine">point-blank with the pistols. Pappy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Yankee had reloaded and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Long Sam did then what he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned all along, if it came to that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He laid the flat side of the blade on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rump of the mule that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">bucking the worst, cut the leather</seg><seg type="columnLine">trace, and the beast jumped off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the boat into the water. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Long Sam belted the other mule and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it snatched the wagon and tumbled it</seg><seg type="columnLine">onto the Indian canoe, long Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">whacking rapidly at traces and tie</seg><seg type="columnLine">ropes to free this animal and the led</seg><seg type="columnLine">mules and the cow and calf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Such a milling around Long Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">never dreamed of. Four mules and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cattle churning the river. Redskins</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to get out from under the wag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. Wagon, swimming cows and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mules, canoe, and ferryboat by this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time had drifted down the river far</seg><seg type="columnLine">past the landing. An Indian who</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't died, given up, or swum away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and who still had his gun, shot at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pappy. Long Sam saw Pappy grow</seg><seg type="columnLine">limp. The Yank killed the Indian.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Betty was still lying on her belly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol in hand. Long Sam discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood running out of him over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes, and stared at it in wonder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He decided he would stay alive long</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to get the treadmill mule's leg</seg><seg type="columnLine">undone and see if it would be possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble to navigate the ferryboat back up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river, by warping and poling. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yank examined Pappy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I seen 'em hit worse'n that and</seg><seg type="columnLine">live to fight another day, bub," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said to Long Sam. "I'm one of 'em.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he's sorter bunged up, at that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood and looked in all direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. "By Judas, where's my old</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's gone, Paw," Betty said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gone where?"	^</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long Sam pulled off his shirt. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw something that looked like a rib</seg><seg type="columnLine">sticking out. Betty pushed it back in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound him in bandages. She didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">bawl. She helped Long John and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">father warp the boat back to the land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, tie it up. Strangely, the sun was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still shining. All this had happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">not in a lifetime but in moments--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">not too many even of them. Fifteen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty, at the outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Yank said, "I'm going after,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my cows and my mules and my wag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. I can't go West without them."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Betty helped Long John up the rise</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the shack. The Yank toted Pappy</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and put him in the bed, saying,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll be back soon's I get my animals."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ma was gone. So were the hogs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chickens. Betty said to her father</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a weary kind of finality, "Pa,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm not going West no farther. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to stay right here. This is far</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough toward the setting sun for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A snort of rum raised Long Sam's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes of his life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't miss that half-breed Cody,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Betty," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You didn't?

The idea wasn't new,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he was the first to have the skill</seg><seg type="columnLine">to put the various pieces together</seg><seg type="columnLine">and make them work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first single-shot pistol was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made in Pistola, Italy, in 1540. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hand-held pipe with a large hole at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one end and a smaller one at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. The measured gunpowder was</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured through the large hole and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the lead bullet was seated c*n</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of it. A flame applied to the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole ignited the powder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The flame could be supplied by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of rope soaked in saltpeter</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was ignited, or by a wheel lock</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was wound</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and released to</seg><seg type="columnLine">24</seg><seg type="columnLine">SAM COLT'S KILLER</seg><seg type="columnLine">25</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were applicable to the hand-held</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gunsmiths before Colt's time had</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to perfect a revolving cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would give a soldier multiple</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots, but each design was far too</seg><seg type="columnLine">complicated, using the ignition meth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ods just mentioned. Many of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">did work, at least in principle, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">weren't reliable enough to become</seg><seg type="columnLine">popular, especially when a man's life</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at stake. The same was true of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pepperbox, the term applied to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">multi-barreled pistol which had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of barrels made to revolve in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of the hammer. The advent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">percussion ignition gave Colt his im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The percussion cap was a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal cup with a primer chemical in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its base. It was fitted over a nipple</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the rear of the breech. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammer was snapped on the cap, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">primer flashed through a hole drilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the nipple and leading to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder chamber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Colt saw its possibilites immediate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly and based his revolving-breech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">block rifles and pistols on its use, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had a fight for recognition on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. His only customer at the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be the United States military,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they never accepted the percus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion cap ignition even on muskets</seg><seg type="columnLine">until after the war with Mexico in</seg><seg type="columnLine">1848--almost 32 years after the cap</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been perfected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one knows exactly how Colt be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came interested in firearms. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a combination of his inventive</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit (he also made an underwater</seg><seg type="columnLine">bomb--which didn't go off--and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, a submarine mine--which did)</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the fact that he was forced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave Amherst Academy when he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">15 for shooting off a firearm, an act</seg><seg type="columnLine">strictly forbidden by the school.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sam Colt had gotten his charter</seg><seg type="columnLine">from New Jersey in 1836, and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own factory in Paterson. He called</seg><seg type="columnLine">it the Patent Arms Company. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">first step was to whittle wooden</seg><seg type="columnLine">models showing his pistol's mechan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ism, and on the basis of these he</seg><seg type="columnLine">received a few orders from Major</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam Hall of Texas, then still an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dependent republic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In 1837 he took some of his first</seg><seg type="columnLine">real guns to the Washington Arsenal</seg><seg type="columnLine">which rejected them, considering</seg><seg type="columnLine">them too heavy, expensive to make,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too delicate for rough use in battle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and--too much of a tempation for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldier to fire more than once and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus waste ammunition. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American Institute of New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">awarded a gold medal to his ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber revolving-breech rifle which</seg><seg type="columnLine">operated similarly to the pistol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a demonstration with it he fired</seg><seg type="columnLine">50 ball bullets in less than nine min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes, hand-loading from a powder</seg><seg type="columnLine">flask and using percussion caps. For-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty of the bullets were shot at a 40-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard target 12 by 30 by 3% inches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twenty-three hit it and all of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">went through it. But they wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to do with his pistol, saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was strictly a military weapon. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time Colt was only 23 years old.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> War had broken out in Florida in</seg><seg type="columnLine">1838. This territory, not a State until</seg><seg type="columnLine">1845, was having trouble with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seminole Indians under the leader-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship of Chief Osceola. Colt packed</seg><seg type="columnLine">100 rifles and pistols and set out for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fort Jupiter on East Florida's In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dian River. He sold them quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">since they were badly needed against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hard-fighting redmen, but he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perienced infinite trouble in getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">payment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In 1839, Colt patented a waterproof</seg><seg type="columnLine">cartridge made of tin foil with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet sealed to it with wax. In this</seg><seg type="columnLine">year his rifles began to become pop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ular, especially among the militia of</seg><seg type="columnLine">New Jersey and Michigan. New Jer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sey had asked Washington for per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission to use Colt's weapons as</seg><seg type="columnLine">standard equipment, but it was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused. Sam Colt was discouraged, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Texas came to his rescue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Texas had won her independence</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Mexico in 1836 soon after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle of the Alamo. The Texas Rang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers, organized in 1835, were using</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of Colt's guns, but they weren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">working too well, especially against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Comanche Indians who became</seg><seg type="columnLine">Texas' big problem after the Mex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">icans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These redmen were cruel and ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complished warriors. Mounted on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast horse, each could shoot 100 ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows so fast that one would be in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air constantly, and each could pierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man easily. In addition to his ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows, each Comanche carried a shield</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a 14-foot spear. They would dash</seg><seg type="columnLine">26</seg><seg type="columnLine">2-GUN WESTERN</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Rangers, fire 20 arrows, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreat, all in the space of a minute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Rangers would dismount for</seg><seg type="columnLine">defense and fight back from afoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one or two single-shot pistols</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a single-shot rifle, each of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to be slowly reloaded by hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The first pistols Colt provided for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them--although they contained as</seg><seg type="columnLine">many as five shots--didn't give the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rangers all the help they needed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pistols had to be taken apart in</seg><seg type="columnLine">three pieces (barrel, cylinder with</seg><seg type="columnLine">five chambers, and frame), the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of powder had to be poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">into each chamber, followed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wad that held the powder in place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed by the ball on top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wad, whereupon the pistol was reas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembled. All this took time, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly could not be carried out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a prancing or galloping horse, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant that in spite of greater fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">power the men were still at a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">disadvantage: they still had to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mount in order to fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Colt's new five-shot one-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece pistol, patented in 1839, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned the tide for Texas. Thanks to</seg><seg type="columnLine">its built-in rammer, this weapon no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer needed to be taken apart, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the reloading operation re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained basically the same it could</seg><seg type="columnLine">now be carried out on horseback, thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing the Rangers' maneuverabili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty up to par with the Indians'.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A number of years later the Rang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers were under the command of Capt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Coffee Hays of Tennessee. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">and 14 of his men were returning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">San Antonio after a scouting trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they were attacked by 80 Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anches who raced at them in the usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion, expecting the men to fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">their weapons and then, before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could reload, the Indians would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">15 scalps on their belts. But they</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know the Rangers were armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the new Colts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A short while later they fled, leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing 40 redmen on the field. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">white men were injured. Now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Comanches soon sued for peace. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief said that it was impossible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight a white man who had a shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">for every finger of his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was just the beginning. Or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders came from the Texian Fleet (not</seg><seg type="columnLine">called Texan until it was annexed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a state) for 180 carbines at $55 each</seg><seg type="columnLine">and 180 belt pistols at $35 each. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Texas Rangers wanted 120 carbines</seg><seg type="columnLine">and 160 pistols. In 1840 Florida</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered rifles, pistols and 100,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">waterproof cartridges for use in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamps. A resolution was introduced</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the U. S. Senate to provide the</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed forces with Colts and Sam was</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy when it looked as though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might at last be on the verge of suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess--but this happiness was short-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The turbulent politics of 1841 saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">three presidents--Van Buren, Har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rison and Tyler--and Colt's resolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was lost in the shuffle. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">government finally bought 100 car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bines. In this year its Harper's Ferry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arsenal finally turned out a military</seg><seg type="columnLine">percussion rifle, but full conversion</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't come until seven years later.</seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR A few years Sam Colt was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">real trouble. His company went</seg><seg type="columnLine">bankrupt; he was arrested for a $400</seg><seg type="columnLine">debt; his brother was convicted of</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder and killed himself in his cell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving his destitute family on Sam's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. Then, in 1846, Texas saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colt, as Colt had previously saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">Texas in her war with the Indians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Texas acquired statehood in Feb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruary, 1846, and in April, United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States soldiers fought against Mex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">icans; the Mexican War had begun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Sam Walker came to New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York to get Colt firearms--lots of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. But Colt had no money, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even machinery. It had all been sold</seg><seg type="columnLine">when his Patent Arms Company went</seg><seg type="columnLine">bankrupt, but Sam refused to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">licked. He made a contract with Eli</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitney for the manufacture of 1,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">six-shot pistols in his plant. Colt</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't even have one of his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistols as a sample to begin produc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Finally he obtained one from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend. Holsters were made from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooden model Capt. Walker submit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted to the manufacturer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the contract was completed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in 1847, Colt took the machinery and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tools, as per his agreement with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitney, and moved to New Haven.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the Ordnance Department, hin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered by red tape, was very slow to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spect and approve the first 1,000 pis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tols in spite of pressure by Walker</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Colt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally the weapons arrived in</seg><seg type="columnLine">SAM COLT'S KILLER</seg><seg type="columnLine">27</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vera Cruz five days after Walker</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been killed, a "smoking Colt in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand," at Huamantla, Mexico,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when two companies of Rangers held</seg><seg type="columnLine">off 2,500 Mexicans. Walker was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first to refer to the pistol as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peacemaker, and wrote a glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">testimonial for it before he died.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Colt had arrived. Government</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders increased, and orders for sam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ples came in from England, Turkey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Germany, France and Russia, all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them curious to see the weapon made</seg><seg type="columnLine">famous by the Mexican War. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">the war the Mexicans demanded them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in great quantities; they had had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">first-hand demonstration of the ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rific gun and needed no selling. Busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness increased by leaps and bounds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pistols were improved by fluted</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders and pins between the per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussion nipples. The Colt factory</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved to bigger quarters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was a period of expansion to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the West. The frontier was pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the Pacific by men armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with plows and Colts, axes and Colts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifles and Colts, and bibles and Colts</seg><seg type="columnLine">(such as Brigham Young of Utah, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom Sam gave an engraved pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his guns). The pistol embodied both</seg><seg type="columnLine">the law of the marshal and the law-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessoess of the rustler and bandit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In 1851 Sam went to London with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams of creating a great gun em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pire there, too. At the Great Ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hibition in Hyde Park he had a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">play which eclipsed anything yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen in the trade. He matched his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol in a contest against the British</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adam's revolver, and won hands-</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. About 400 were purchased by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the British Colonial Office for use</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the Kaffir tribes in the Cape</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Good Hope. In 1853 he opened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge branch factory (later closed be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause the British would no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">tolerate this competition) at Pimlico</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Thames, and the English</seg><seg type="columnLine">marveled at the speed with which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could produce production-line re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volvers which could compete with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their custom-made models.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back in the United States the Colt</seg><seg type="columnLine">works were going full blast. Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">modore Perry wanted 100 for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Navy, which was the first sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest from that branch of the serv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice. But business was so good that</seg><seg type="columnLine">competitors were trying to get into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the act and soon became guilty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">direct infringement of his patents.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colt sued the one who appeared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the most dangerous threat to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">empire, the Massachusetts Arms Co.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and won. Then a new episode oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curred which bore testimony to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In 1853 Colonel John C. Fremont,</seg><seg type="columnLine">governor of California, made an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploratory trip across the Rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mountains together with 19 men to</seg><seg type="columnLine">determine railroad sites. One day at</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp they were attacked by 60 Ute</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians who told them they wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplies and gunpowder. If they</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't have these, they would kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white men. Fremont gave in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structions to one of his men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">went outside, put a piece of paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a tree, and shot it with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Navy Colt. The Indians laughed;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could do the same with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own rifles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the gunman fired a second and</seg><seg type="columnLine">third time. Then the chief shot the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colt, as did two of his braves. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were amazed and decided they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">gladly pay for their supplies with</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses. They couldn't fight men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had guns which never needed re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loading.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In 1855 Colt completed a vast new</seg><seg type="columnLine">armory on the banks of the Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">necticut River in Hartford. Its Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sian dome can still be seen from afar</seg><seg type="columnLine">by tourists traveling the main route</seg><seg type="columnLine">through Hartford between New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Boston. In that year he incorpor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated his business into the Colt's Pat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent Fire-Arms Manufacturing Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany. Now there was no more to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">done, and although only 41, Colt was</seg><seg type="columnLine">old before his time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had succeeded in making his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream come true, but he was a sick</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. He had contracted inflammatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">rheumatism, was getting worse. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Civil War was imminent. The State</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Virginia asked Colt to investigate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the possibility of building an armory</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Richmond, and he sent one of hfs</seg><seg type="columnLine">men to investigate but his heart wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it. Georgia, Alabama, Carolina--all</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleaded with him for arms. In 1861</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Confederate States of America</seg><seg type="columnLine">were formed and Colt offered his serv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ices to Lincoln, advising him to arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">1,000,000 men immediately.</seg><seg type="columnLine">(please turn to page 75)</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mojave Jack was a paid killer.

His face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all hard angles and planes, giving an</seg><seg type="columnLine">overall impression of flatness, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were blue.

The marks of his trade were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the single gun he wore, low, tied</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, its black butt shiny with wear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the thin leather gloves that</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered his hands even on this hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">day.

Bill Osborn asked hotly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nothing," Jim said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean, nothing?"

I'll try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">protect you, bist I can't guarantee it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim strode through them and out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office, leaving an uneasy silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A S HE WALKED slowly down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Palace, Jim was thinking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were right, of course. Mojave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack was a killer and he was here on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mission, but he was within his rights</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be here. Jim had seen the gunman</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill a man two years before in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cheyenne and he didn't like the idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of going against him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still, this was his town and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to enforce the law and protect the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. If that meant going against</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mojave Jack, he would have to do it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he was busy trying to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">who it could be that the killer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">after. It was impossible to tell, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone could have hired him to shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">any man in town. Jim shook his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and entered the saloon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Monty Ferris, the owner, was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the bar and he raised his eye-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brows in mute warning when Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked in. Jim merely nodded to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swept his eyes around the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he found the still figure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mojave Jack sitting at one of the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">tables, his chair backed against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. The gunman was watching Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a strict attention, his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless on the table. Jim crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room and stood beside the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Welcome to Bent Fork, Jack," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "I'm Jim Forbes, marshal here."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Glad to meet you, Marshal," Mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jave Jack said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've got people here all in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat," Jim said. "They're takin' it</seg><seg type="columnLine">out on me. How long were you plan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nin' to stay?" Jim pushed his words</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the gunman slow and easy, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanting to anger him. Jim knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mojave Jack could probably beat him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a fight and therefore, he wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">no fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't see that it's any of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">business," the gunman replied coolly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was insolence in his tone and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that puzzled Jim. The gunman acted</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a man looking for trouble. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">from what Jim knew of Jack's type,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they only fought when they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid to kill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just the same, I think you'd bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter tell me. You're welcome here</seg><seg type="columnLine">overnight. After that, you're not wel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come. I thought we'd better have an</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding about that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mojave Jack smiled tightly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're a brave man, Marshal. I ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mire a brave man, as long as he isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fool. It would be foolish to try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">send me out of town before I'm ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go." The gunman's eyes were wide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprung and Jim smelled trouble on</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The man was cocked, ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight, and Jim didn't understand it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm just hopin' you'll go without</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. Noon tomorrow should be time</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough. Don't stay beyond that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned on his heel and walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the saloon, catching the fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened look on Monty Ferris' face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">30</seg><seg type="columnLine">2-GUN WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Going back to the office, Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">pondered his conversation with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunman. He was puzzled by Mojave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack's edginess. It was almost as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the man had wanted a fight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that couldn't be. If he was here</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kill a man, he would want to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of trouble until the job was done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps he thought that everyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">was afraid of him and consequently</seg><seg type="columnLine">was insolent with everyone. But if</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were true, he was doing some</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong thinking. Jim wasn't afraid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mojave Jack. He had a respect for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack's ability with a gun, but better</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunmen had gone down. If it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a fight, it wouldn't be the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time Jim had looked through gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He intended to keep a sharp watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Jack while he was in town and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended to enforce his order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave. He had governed Bent Fork</seg><seg type="columnLine">for better than a year and no man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to change that just by riding in</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a big reputation and scaring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">JIM KEPT A sharp watch on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street all afternoon and it amused</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to see Fred Keaton slip out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back door of the bank, saddle a horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">and line out of town. Something was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Keaton's conscience and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking no chances. At three Ed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holmes also rode out. By five o'clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">six respected businessmen had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted hurriedly. The town was quiet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though peopled by dead men. No-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one moved abroad and tension hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the street like summer heat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">close and binding. At six o'clock Mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jave Jack came from the Palace and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strode unhurriedly to Nell Peterson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cafe. Jeff left the office and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down there at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim sat four stools down from Mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jave Jack and ordered his supper. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunman had given him one cool ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">praising glance when he came in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was all. After that the two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignored each other and ate in a strict</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence. Nell Peterson was nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made an unaccustomed racket as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she served the three other customers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She dropped a cup and the sound was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a shot. Men along the counter</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped at the noise and then grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolishly. Everyone ate in frantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">haste and departed. Mojave jack took</seg><seg type="columnLine">his time, drinking a second cup of</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffee when he had finished his meal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He and Jim were the only two diners</seg><seg type="columnLine">left in the cafe. Nell Peterson came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take Jack's dollar and the gunman</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled at her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You ain't too particular who you</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve, are you, ma'am?" he asked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to look full on at Jim. Nell's</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue eyes darkened with fear and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand shook as she picked up the dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar. She couldn't answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you on the prod, Jack?" Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked softly. "If you are, just make</seg><seg type="columnLine">it plain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, no, Marshal, not at all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What ever gave you that idea?" Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">got up in one quick movement and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to the door. He stopped there</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned about and asked, "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was noon tomorrow, wasn't it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So-long, Marshal," Jack said and</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the cafe. Jim sat still, more puz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zled than before, trying to make sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the gunman's words. Nell came</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the counter and put her hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Jim, don't cross him. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill a man just for the fun'of it. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can see it in his eyes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was a tall girl, strong and well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">built, a girl who had always had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work hard for what she got. She and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim had gone together off and on for</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the time he had been here. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could never quite face the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of settling down and being married,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so he had never asked her. Her pride</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too strong to let her push him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But she loved him and she couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceal it at this moment. Looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her, Jim thought she was lovely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He squeezed her hand and smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't worry, honey, he's just edgy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His kind don't shoot men for fun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's been hired to kill someone here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as soon as he's done his job, he'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride out. I stepped on his toes when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I told him to be out of town by</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow noon and he wants to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">me he isn't scared any. But he'll get</seg><seg type="columnLine">his job done before noon and be out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But won't you have to arrest him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for murder?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's too smart for that. He'll make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other man draw first and claim</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-defense. I won't have anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold him for."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But he was mad at you, Jim. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">NOON TOMORROW</seg><seg type="columnLine">31</seg><seg type="columnLine">way he looked at you, I thought he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going to draw on you right in</seg><seg type="columnLine">here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It almost seemed that way," Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed, "but it couldn't be. He'd have</seg><seg type="columnLine">no reason for hunting me. No-one</seg><seg type="columnLine">would pay good money to have me</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed. No, he's just a killer and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">all go off the deep end in time. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves are probably about shot." Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood up and smiled again. "Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry about him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope you're right," she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtfully. He started for the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she said, "Jim," and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">around th*e counter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">HE STOPPED and she walked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him and kissed him on the lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stepped back, her face very grave.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It surprised him so that he stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless for a moment and then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped forward, took her in his arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kissed her fully. When he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leased her and stepped back, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaken by the intensity of the kiss</seg><seg type="columnLine">and by the warm crush of her soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">body against him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I guess," he said, "it is time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">either fish or cut bait, is that it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nell?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's for you to know, Jim."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Why, I suppose that's right. I'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">around to see you sometime after</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon tomorrow." He stepped forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kissed her quickly and wheeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to walk from the cafe. The blonde</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl stood with her hands pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over her heart and her face heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">with worry for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A boy on the street told Jim that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mojave Jack was again in the Palace</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he wondered about that. The gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was apparently in no hurry to</seg><seg type="columnLine">seek out his victim. With only a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours remaining to him, it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange that Jack would not get to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. Jim couldn't believe that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunman would wait past noon. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">would mean another fight and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man who knew how to use a gun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack's kind didn't take unnecessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maybe Jack thought his victim</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come to the saloon tonight, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that ordinarily wouldn't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">too far off, since the Palace was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town's best saloon. But everyone knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gunman was in town and if a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had any reason to think that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked for death, he would not go</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the place. Several men.had rid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den out already. It had Jim baffled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made his usual night rounds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitting all the saloons, including the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palace, and everything was running</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoothly. In most of the places a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sizeable crowd was on hand and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all eager to talk to Jim about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mojave Jack. Jim didn't stop to talk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew no more about it than they</seg><seg type="columnLine">did. The word was out that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given the killer until tomorrow noon</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave and they were speculating</seg><seg type="columnLine">about that, but he let them speculate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he came to the Palace, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it deserted except for Mojave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack, old Doc Barnes and Monty</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ferris. The gunman only glanced at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim incuriously and went back to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">game of cards. Ferris shrugged ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressively and Jim shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went out and down the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">and met Nell as she closed the cafe</seg><seg type="columnLine">at ten. He walked her home and nei-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther of them mentioned Mojave Jack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew she was worried, but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew men and she sensed that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't want to talk about it. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">would do her worrying in private.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His respect for her increased with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knowledge that she refused to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make his job tougher by saddling him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her worries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After he left Nell, Jim continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">his patrol of the streets until mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nite, but the town was quiet. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time of year when there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty of work on the ranches and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only big night was Saturday. Mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jave Jack sat quietly in the Palace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing no interest in the town or</seg><seg type="columnLine">its people, a deadly enigma. Shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head in wonder, Jim went to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">room at the hotel, undressed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned in. He laid awake a long time</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking, but got nowhere and final-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly dropped into an uneasy sleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THE MORNING, Jim was down</seg><seg type="columnLine">early and had breakfast at Nell's.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were dark circles under her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, telling of a sleepless night, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had a smile for him and she didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">mention Mojave Jack. After break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast, he went to the Palace and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monty Ferris in his office in the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the saloon. There was no-one else</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the place, except Ernie Shields,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the swamper, who was lazily sweep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up. Jim sat down and pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hat back and smiled at Monty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">32</seg><seg type="columnLine">2-GUN WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, what happened?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing happened," the saloon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper said tersely. "Except he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruined my business. He just sat there</seg><seg type="columnLine">dealin' cards and watchin' the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He drank one beer between eight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one and got up and left. I can't fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure it out. Somethin's up, but I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the drift of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't either. I was certain he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came here to kill someone and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">acts like he did, but nothin's hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened and he doesn't go lookin' for</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone." Jim got up and settled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat on his head. "If he starts any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in here this morning, let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">know and I'll come runnin'. He didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride clear up here from Cheyenne for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exercise."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If he's still here at noon, what're</seg><seg type="columnLine">you going to do?" Monty asked flat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell him to leave town."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And if he don't go?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll have to put him out. He's done</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing I can arrest him for, but he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbin' the peace just the same. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him time enough; at noon, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">goes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't envy you the job. He's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean one. You look into his eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's nothing there. They're as cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a dead mackerel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So-long, Monty," Jim said and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked through the saloon and out</seg><seg type="columnLine">onto the board walk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was just up the street from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel now and Mojave Jack came out</seg><seg type="columnLine">onto the porch. He looked up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Jim and a cold smile touched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corners of his mouth. It was less a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile than a smirk and Jim felt a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold tingle along his spine, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a warning. There was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">evil about Mojave Jack, something</seg><seg type="columnLine">missing that was found in decent men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it shook everyone when they saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim returned the stare and Mojave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack nodded and turned off the porch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He went up the street and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">in at the cafe. Jim angled across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street to his office. He dropped into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chair and prepared to wait. Until</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mojave Jack showed his hand, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was little he could do. He took out</seg><seg type="columnLine">his .45, checked the brass butts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loads, slid the gun back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">holster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he was pushed by a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst of energy and got to his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and punched the shells out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun. For the next fifteen minutes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he practiced drawing and firing. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew and snapped the hammer at</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictures and reward dodgers on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. Satisfied at last, he replaced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shells in the gun and settled again in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The morning dragged slowly by.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By ten o'clock Jim felt as if he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting on a keg of dynamite. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole town was waiting with a dread</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was faintly mixed with anticipa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Life in Bent Fork was usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty dull and Mojave Jack had</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiped out that dullness. The people</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared him, yet his presence fascin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated them and they had passed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories about him from mouth to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth until now he was reputed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have killed a hundred men and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed to be faster than Wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill. In his office, Jim watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands of the clock crawl towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon and began to think for the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time that Mojave Jack was not going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave. It didn't make sense, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's how it looked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">AT TEN-THIRTY, Jim heard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse come down Main at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallop and went to the window to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see who it was. Johnny Benton, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode for Pete Hanson's Lazy 3, rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the street and pulled into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitchrack at the Palace. Johnny was</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty, slim and reckless and a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild, but a good kid. He was wearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gun, but Mojave Jack wouldn't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">after him. Jim returned to his chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and settled down. He had barely got-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten settled when boots thudded along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walk and Ernie Shields burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the office. The old swamper was</seg><seg type="columnLine">white and shaking with excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Monty says to come quick, Jim.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That killer's got Johnny Benton</seg><seg type="columnLine">cornered and's givin' him a rough</seg><seg type="columnLine">time of it. It looks like Johnny was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one he was after."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim was out of his chair and run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning before the words were out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ernie's mouth. He aimed for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door of the Palace and ran hard, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopping to think about this. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of his mind it seemed strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a high-priced killer like Mojave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack should ride five hundred miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take on Johnny Benton. Johnny</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no gunman. Anyone who half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way knew how to use a gun could</seg><seg type="columnLine">NOON TOMORROW</seg><seg type="columnLine">33</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done a job on Johnny. But in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">haste, Jim didn't take time to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">it out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim piled through the door of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palace and found Johnny Benton</seg><seg type="columnLine">still-posted in the center of the floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mojave Jack leaned back negligently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his elbows resting on the bar. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">right hand was dropped down near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the butt of his gun and that wicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile curled the corners of his lips.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny was white-faced with shock</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fear, but he held his ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What you pickin' on me for?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny asked as Jim came in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I ain't pickin' on you, boy. I just</seg><seg type="columnLine">said you looked like a yellow sheep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">herder. It ain't my fault the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">you look."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim moved up on Johnny's right</seg><seg type="columnLine">side and Mojave Jack straightened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A queer light came into his eyes, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glitter, and suddenly it hit Jim with</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the force of a sledge-hammer blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the belly. It wasn't Johnny Benton</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the killer wanted. That was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruse. His real victim was Jim Forbes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a moment the knowledge para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lyzed Jim and then his mind began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to function coldly and surely. If he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to survive, he had to think clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, surely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get out of here, Johnny," Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "There'll be no fightin' in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">town." Johnny wanted to go, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't want to appear a coward, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hung back for a moment. "Get</seg><seg type="columnLine">movin', Johnny," Jim said again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time the young puncher left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monty Ferris stirred behind the bar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though released from the weight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some mighty load. He sighed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jim laughed then and he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise momentarily break the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of Mojave Jack's eyes. "You can</seg><seg type="columnLine">quit actin', Jack. It took me long</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, but I finally know who you</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to kill. Why didn't you just</seg><seg type="columnLine">say so yesterday afternoon instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparrin' around all this time? You</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to kill me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim heard Monty Ferris gasp and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then Mojave Jack's harsh voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">rasped through the stillness. "That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, Marshal, I came to get you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">no-one hired me to do it. I wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">an excuse to get you to draw on me</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that young puncher was it. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wouldn't quite take the bait. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">got here too fast."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim was placed twenty paces from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mojave Jack and he wasn't going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">let the man get any closer. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty paces a man could easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">miss, especially if he hurried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot. Jim didn't fool himself that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could outdraw the killer, so he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make the man miss that first shot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What did I ever do to you?" Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You killed my brother in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street here last fall. He didn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jim remembered the man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking back he could see now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a strong family resemblance</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the two.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I remember," he said. "He was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">here drinking and causing trouble. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned him to cut it out and left. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed me out and called to me as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I walked across the street. He drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fired when I turned on him. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">first shot missed and mine didn't."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You killed him and I'm here to</seg><seg type="columnLine">square accounts. That's all that mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That would be all that mattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you," Jim said, a sneer in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. "Sure, I shot him down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd do it again. He was a worthless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gutless punk, Jack, just like you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw the words hit the gunman</seg><seg type="columnLine">like physical blows, saw the hate that</seg><seg type="columnLine">flared in his eyes. Mojave Jack's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth twitched spasmodically and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like a crazy man. Jim felt cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">and alone, his senses acutely tuned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to every move the deadly one in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mojave Jack said, "I'm going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot you in the belly and watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">you claw the floor while you die."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stopped talking and Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed at him. Jim saw the gunman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes flicker wildly once, then nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row, saw his shoulder dip, and Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew. Mojave Jack's draw was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash that beat Jim a full tenth of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second. The killer's' gun roared and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bucked back in his hand, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slug missed Jim's hip a split hair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim's gun was out and he fired, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">aiming. He lowered the gun to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, knowing he would have no time</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a second shot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mojave Jack was jerked back</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the bar as though some</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty fist had smashed him in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest. His gun fell from his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bounced once on the floor.

He had, in fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">graced the boards of Washington</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hall and Sacramento's Eagle Theater</seg><seg type="columnLine">in drama both legitimate and lusty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His present exile was purely the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sult of an unprecedented emotional</seg><seg type="columnLine">collision with Miss Ellen O'Faye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had fallen in love, which was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of outrageous interest super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">imposed upon no principal. If he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in love, he also was chronically penni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less and with scant prospects for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future. He'd fled like a coward from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss O'Faye; placed many miles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brawling gold camps between them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe she would go away, back East,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and become famous and leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">West and Caleb Halloway alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inside his patchwork shanty of can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vas and board, Caleb donned a ruffled</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt and a cravat, a waistcoat of calf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin and a frock coat cut high in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and with fine buttons and wide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">silk lapels. The coat alone had cost</seg><seg type="columnLine">him $50 during a brief, golden period</seg><seg type="columnLine">along San Francisco's Ambrosial Path.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On his head he cocked a silk hat with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a broad, graceful roll, which added a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine dignity to his appearance.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded to many around and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting, silent.

"The court," he said, "is in order."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked to the tree and gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">solemnly at Joe Salem. Joe was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">young, fiery-eyed man of bullish</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength and a reputation for sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">violence. He spat contemptuously at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ruffled shirt front, but Caleb</seg><seg type="columnLine">craftily side-stepped without losing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his composure.

If there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a stiffer man in the Mother Lode,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was not sober to suffer as Caleb</seg><seg type="columnLine">did. His legs and arms ached sorely</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his head seemed split and held</seg><seg type="columnLine">together only by the bandage bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly over his brow. One eye was</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple, puffed and closed and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower lip felt like some frog sat there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His nose was broken fearsomely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he groaned as the chill air buffed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the first ray of sun topped a</seg><seg type="columnLine">craggy peak, Caleb stopped beside a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream to bathe his face. He sat awhile</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rest and cast a suspicious eye on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his companion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe Salem knelt down like a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man to cup his hands and drink at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stream. When he stood up, Caleb</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see the pain in the deeply drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines around his mouth. Caleb could</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine the striated back shorn of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh and stiffening in the cold. Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like some thick trunk of tree bit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten cruelly by the axe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You should have stole a horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">'stead of tanglin' with John Duncan."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe said to Caleb.

"John's in poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape this morning, too," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe Salem nodded. "You was doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine till the two of you went 20 feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">down that coyote shaft."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Caleb winced at the recollection of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that plunge; the rock sides of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft burning his hide raw and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slag-heap landing that came near to</seg><seg type="columnLine">unhinge-ing him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You've busted me up for fair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe," Caleb said accusingly. "I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a respected man in the community</seg><seg type="columnLine">till you stole a horse and I got mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">at John Duncan and refused to hang</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'd have been elected alcalde in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time."

"They don't want</seg><seg type="columnLine">an alcalde that won't hang a horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">thief. That's why I was told to git</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they dragged me from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thing is, I ain't a real horse thief,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">PINAL CURTAIN</seg><seg type="columnLine">37</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Joe.

You're a man of justice. . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You would have done until a real</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse thief came along," said Caleb.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He got to his feet, rolled a little with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dizziness, and then started north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From Mt. Bullion, to Bear Valley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Bagby, to Coulterville and on north</seg><seg type="columnLine">he marched in the coming days. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a painful journey to a man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride. Caleb felt the deep pity for</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself--an actor with both his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spirit mauled; an odd figure in</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough pants and jacket cast off by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some camp along the way; a filthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">flop-brimmed hat partially obscuring</seg><seg type="columnLine">a battered face thick-matted with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tawny beard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was the night the "hewgag"</seg><seg type="columnLine">brayed in a lonely Sierra camn where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caleb and Joe found refuge. The An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient and Honorable Order of E</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clampus Vitus assaulted the black si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lences with hilarious revelry and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">salubrious parade beneath a mammoth</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoopskirt emblazoned "This Is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Banner We Fight Under!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Argonauts fought the ravages of</seg><seg type="columnLine">toil and boredom heroically that night</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even Joe Salem marched and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">duly initiated into bacchic and bliss-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful unconsciousness.

"You're a man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">justice, Caleb." he'd said. But Caleb</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that this was not so.

And Reno</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned immensely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">FINAL CURTAIN</seg><seg type="columnLine">39</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's the only answer," one man</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared. "Marry 'em up, Temescal!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Uncle Windmill crossed the space</seg><seg type="columnLine">in three short jumps. His nose col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lided agonizingly with Reno's sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly doubled fist. He shuddered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">groaned aloud and fell face-forward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ellen was down beside him swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Temescal took out his gun and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired twice in the air to restore order.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sight of the girl there minister-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the fallen O'Faye sobered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of Dogleg more effectively than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Temescal's gunfire. Fun and hell are</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine, but no lady is treated like that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the very midst of the crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly stepped a newcomer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp, holding up his hands, demand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing attention. Joe Salem, a flushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and angry man, addressed Temescal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's a gent here who can talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this case," he said loudly. "He's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man born with a nugget of sense--</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is worth more than all the gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll dig out of this hell-hole. I de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand he be heard. I refer to my pard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner standing over there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Faces turned toward Caleb Hallo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way and a path opened to where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood. Nervously, Caleb pulled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat brim low and straightened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders. He was painfully conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Ellen, still kneeling beside Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Windmill, but looking intently at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. This was a shameful entrance</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was being forced upon him by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the treacherous Joe Salem.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Judge Halloway!" Joe Salem an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced, burning all bridges behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Temescal Murphy sought to assess</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caleb. "You know about this dispute</seg><seg type="columnLine">--Judge?" he said cautiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Caleb nodded. There was the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">now of recognition in Ellen's eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was the mouth opening slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in disbelief. And there was finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">an urgent and troubling cue for ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Ellen's cue pierced a wave of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such fright and dread as Caleb had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never experienced before. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sorry spectacle he made, but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no place to run or hide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dogleg's a fair and just camp," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to say, pulling his eyes from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ellen's. His mind reached back fever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishly into his considerations of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleepless night before. He had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Joe Salem's account of this dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pute minutely and somewhere he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught a spark of light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's been held in other camps--</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to common sense--that gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">digging is a franchise from the gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernment, free to all," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused to look around, let his</seg><seg type="columnLine">words sink in, to build some impact</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the crowd. "If Reno Cucci staked</seg><seg type="columnLine">a claim on quartz ledges, let him work</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quartz ledges."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He waited another moment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked down at Uncle Windmill. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">William O'Faye staked a placer--</seg><seg type="columnLine">even in the very midst of the quartz</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledges--let him use that placer claim."</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a murmur and shuffling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of feet among the miners. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripe now for any fair way out. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl kneeling down by her uncle there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a plumb embarrassing sight to</seg><seg type="columnLine">men instinctively chivalrous; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, too, this new fellow was talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I say this," said Caleb, warming to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his subject, "if in that same gulch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reno Cucci and William O'Faye I</seg><seg type="columnLine">find a breeze that carries gold dust, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be allowed to stake a claim on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that breeze and strain gold from it</seg><seg type="columnLine">against all comers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The final point immensely amused</seg><seg type="columnLine">and appealed to the men of Dogleg.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They forthwith and loudly voted</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanction of Uncle Windmill's placer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim and hauled him victoriously to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tent saloon for purposes of vigor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous revival. Temescal Murphy shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, "The dispute's settled," and led</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Reno Cucci stayed behind. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">intercepted Caleb on the way out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp. He drew the long knife fast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with deadly purpose, but he never go*,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use it. Joe Salem's fist, from out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nowhere, nearly pulverized an ear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove him senseless to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The law is good, but you got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">back it up, Caleb." said Joe Salem,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinning and rubbing at his big</seg><seg type="columnLine">knuckles. Then he noticed the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">and promptly hustled toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathering where Uncle Windmill's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wits were being joyously resurrected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ellen O'Faye said, "Judge Hallo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, as I live and breathe!" And there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a tender mockery in her eyes as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she hurried toward him that purely</seg><seg type="columnLine">captured Caleb.	•END</seg><seg type="columnLine">DICK BAIRD</seg><seg type="columnLine">The victim wai directly in his sights.</seg><seg type="columnLine">MAN'S</seg><seg type="columnLine">HAND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">SHATTUCK was dead even be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fore he pitched from saddle.

Whinnying soft-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, the horse then turned and gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loped back the way he'd come--along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the winding bed of the Rake. The riv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er was low--there had been little rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Sassafee Valley--and the clay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank's hoofs shot occasional sparks</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he pounded back toward Tonka</seg><seg type="columnLine">City.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mineral Saloon was quiet, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most empty.

He threw down his cards and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't like this business." Parnell</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> was tall, almost gaunt, and his gray</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> eyes narrowed in their wide-set sock-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ets.

He ran his thumb along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray stubble of his beard and fanned</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand. Aces-and-eights. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">first at Cliff Bristow, and then at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cliff's brother, Jim. Neither spoke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Cliff quietly picked up the "dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's hand" and shuffled it into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sound of running feet thudded</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the porch.

He pulled the flat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowned Stetson low over his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's get going," Parnell said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three.

Jep held up his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ralston, you and I will follow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed. Cliff, you and Jim trail along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bench, fifty yards apart. Keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">your eyes peeled."</seg><seg type="columnLine">A BRIGHT three-quarter moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a sky full of stars aided the</seg><seg type="columnLine">search. They rode in silence; Jep</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the edge of the river, Keen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ralston near the rise of the bank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Bristows spread out on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelf. The clop of hoofs and the oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casional clang of a shoe on a rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all that broke the silence. Twen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty minutes went by without a trace</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Shattuck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mighty nice night to be lookin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a dead man, Jep said to himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe he isn't dead, though. Lots of</seg><seg type="columnLine">things could have happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he didn't believe what he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying, and he snapped shut his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth in a thin hard line. He bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward in the saddle, and his gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes drilled holes in the river's edge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe he went down the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side," Keen's voice reached for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the stillness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't think so," Jep answered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He'd just have to ford the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther up. No, I reckon he's on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the Rake."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How come he took off for Pome-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roy tonight? Even if one of Poler's</seg><seg type="columnLine">slicks did jump his claim, they ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothin' he can do about it till morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. The courthouse won't open till</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight or nine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jep rolled a cigarette. The glow of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the match cast a yellow flicker across</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lean, craggy face. "Probably fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ured he'd get the jump on Poler by</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving tonight. Ben's probably got</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stakeout on his place. Poler wants</seg><seg type="columnLine">that water bad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Shattuck never made it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lookathere." Jep pulled over, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keen's gnarled finger pointed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shattuck's body lying in the shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jep reined up. "Call Cliff and Jim.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poler must be crazy. Shattuck never</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmed anybody. He was killed just</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he was sittin' across Poler's</seg><seg type="columnLine">creek--at least Ben called his creek</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and that gun-happy thief is loco</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to pull the same job on any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one who gets in his way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ralston whistled twice, and Cliff</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bristow's shout answered. Keen's</seg><seg type="columnLine">white hair caught the moon's rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he held his hat and knelt beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shattuck's body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Plumb between the eyes," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a low voice. "Never had a chance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Looks like a .30-30 hole. Whoever</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot him must have meen waitin' in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that outcropping over yonder."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keen pointed toward the bank with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hat, and Jep's gaze followed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Close to the edge of the shelf, at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bend in the river, was a pile or rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">which commanded an open view for</seg><seg type="columnLine">42</seg><seg type="columnLine">2-GUN WESTERN</seg><seg type="columnLine">200 yards upstream. Jep nodded and</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed for the rocks. Ralston and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Bristow brothers sat down beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shattuck and waited for his return.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only the sloshing of the river broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">the silence. They were thinking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Len Conway and Mart Haskins and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sheriff Thomas--and now Shattuck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ralston threw a stone into the riv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er. "Reckon I was wrong about Poler</seg><seg type="columnLine">layin' quiet. Looks like we'll have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little set-to with the boys." The pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of aces-and-eights came to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. "And that's okay with me. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">tellin' who cashes in on a dead man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand."</seg><seg type="columnLine">IN A FEW minutes Jep reappeared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He held out his hand. In his palm</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay an empty .30-30 rifle shell. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff's eyes swept the three men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The granite hardness of his gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">scraped against the steel edge of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is Poler's work, sure as</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazes. Whoever killed Shattuck was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dead shot, because Ben knew he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't take any chances on his get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting away. Who would you "say is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best rifleman in Poler's outfit?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ralston spat against a white rock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and watched the brown juice slide</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the side. "I reckon Deck Koog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ler's about it. I seen him knock the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spots off a trey last spring when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">won Curly Bettner's roan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Parnell turned the shell in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers. "I doubt that he would head</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to Poler's tonight--too far and</seg><seg type="columnLine">too late. Chances are he's holed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">someplace, either waiting for the oth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers, or fixin' to head in later."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ben's got a line shack about eight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine miles from here. Sets in valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple miles west of the Rake." Cliff</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bristow's voice held a latent charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the thought of a showdown. "I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">better lead the way. We'll go down</seg><seg type="columnLine">river a piece, then I know where to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jep nodded in agreement. He threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blanket over Shattuck. The tension</seg><seg type="columnLine">was mounting, and he knew he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have put all of them into a heap of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble. Poler and his gunnies</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be likely to wait and talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">first... Parnell kept his own coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sel. Plenty of time for such consider-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ations if the need arose; no telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">which way Ben would jump.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first gray streaks of morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">found Cliff Bristow calling a halt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned in his saddle. "Poler's cab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sets just over that ridge. We can</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride closer, but there's a clearing all</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the cabin."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll go over the hill and get as</seg><seg type="columnLine">close as we can." Jep's voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clipped, and Ralston and the Bris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tows knew he was in command again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They rode over the rise and into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pines covering the slope. A wisp of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke rose from the stone chimney.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eight horses, saddled and ready,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood at the side of the shack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're all inside," Jep said as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismounted, "but we can't just walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">in and open up. We've got no real</seg><seg type="columnLine">proof that Ben had anything to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Shattuck's death--even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">we do know it ourselves. We've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get him to show his hand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ralston and the Bristows spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and took cover behind the trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rocks. They could see both sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cabin as well as the front. Jep</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupped his hands around his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shouted: "Poler, this is Sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parnell. We've got the drop on you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so don't try to run. I've come to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">you in for killing Shattuck."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Silence greeted him. For three</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes no sound came from the cab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, then Poler's voice boomed up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the hill. "You got nothin' on</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, Sheriff. I don't know anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Shattuck or what's happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him.

Ralston's low growl</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried to Parnell's ears. "Better</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer him, Jep."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jep knew he had to gamble. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped into the open and held his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands away from his gun. "No use</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasting time, Ben. We found Shat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuck before he died, and he recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized Deck Koogler's horse and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">green jacket when he rode off. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">all heard him name you and Koogler.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Besides, I've got a .30-30 shell from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Koogler's rifle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A rifle cracked and dirt spurted up</seg><seg type="columnLine">between Parnell's feet. He fell back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and threw two quick shots at the cab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. The Bristow boys and Ralston</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened up as Jep reached the trees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's our answer," Jep gritted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">DEAD MAN'S HAND</seg><seg type="columnLine">43</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Poler thinks we've got him dead to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rights.

"Three," said Ken Ralston.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cliff Bristow lurched from behind a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree, his shoulder spurting blood, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell in a heap at his brother's feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim tore open his shirt and began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tend him.

"I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'll be all right, but he won't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">doin' much shooting with that right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand for a while. Damn that lousy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poler and his slicks." He punctuated</seg><seg type="columnLine">his words by emptying his sixgun at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUN began to climb higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sky. Both sides settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to await the other's move. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">spasmodic bursts of gunfire split the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stillness. Jep and the others kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">changing positions in an effort to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep Poler from knowing how few</seg><seg type="columnLine">were pitted against him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We won't get anywhere this way,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jep said as the morning wore on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Pretty soon they'll come bustin' out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of there and either make a run for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it or spread out and try to finish us</seg><seg type="columnLine">off. Keen, I've got an idea. It's a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot, but it just might be crazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rapidly outlined the plan to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ralston and the Bristows.

Jep asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can throw it," Cliff replied, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I ain't sayin' what I can hit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You just keep pumping if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to.

He worked as close to the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he could and still remain unseen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jep walked slowly toward the cab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, stopping ten yards before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached it. The door was opened wari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, and Ben Poler, Deck Koogler and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a burly gunnie stepped out in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Poler stood with his legs spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide apart. "I'm listenin', Sheriff,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it had better be good. I know you</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't got but three men, and there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">five more in the cabin right behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jep spoke slowly, letting the words</seg><seg type="columnLine">sink in. He was playing for high</seg><seg type="columnLine">stakes, and if he lost this hand it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be his last. "You're wrong,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben. We've just been waiting you</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. Jim Bristow left long ago for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pomeroy. He'll be back any minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Sheriff Benton and a posse, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sworn statement that you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Koogler killed Shattuck.

They clearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't counted on this play.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're bluffing, Jep." Poler's lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a bloodless line. He was trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately to save his hide, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the sands were running out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He glanced back at the cabin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swallowed hard, his adam's apple</seg><seg type="columnLine">running up and down the stubbied</seg><seg type="columnLine">column of his neck. "You know we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can blow our way out of here, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll go first."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you think I'm bluffing.

Above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the line of trees and hills rose a fat</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud of dust moving rapidly, such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as would be made by a large party of</seg><seg type="columnLine">riders pounding hell-for-leather</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Poler swung his head around and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet his lips. His eyes dilated with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fury and he stepped back, hand drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping toward his gun. "Damn you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parnell," he hissed, "if I'm goin' to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hell I'm takin' you with me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ben Poler's Colt came up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame belched from the muzzle, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jep's .44 crashed an instant before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poler's shot plowed into the dirt, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">44</seg><seg type="columnLine">2-GUN WESTERN</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sank to his knees as Jep's slug</seg><seg type="columnLine">dug into his side. A third shot echoed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others, and Deck Koogler's gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell from his fingers; Keen Ralston's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot carried Koogler's tag. A smear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blood grew larger on the gunman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt front, and his coughs brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">red foam to his lips. The burly gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nie hadn't moved, then he dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sixgun and thrust his hands sky-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''You've got about one minute," Jep</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted to the men in the cabin. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to Poler who still knelt in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dirt, the blood oozing from be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween his fingers. "Throw out your</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns and come out with your hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">up or you'll get it just like Ben and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Koogler did."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rest of Poler's bunch had lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">their stomachs for a fight. Revolvers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rifles were thrown through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and windows, and Poler's five</seg><seg type="columnLine">slicks came in a sullen file into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing. Their eyes burned with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatred for both Jep and Poler, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one kicked at his late leader. Keen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ralston, grinning in his gray whisk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers, took up the slack space behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben and his boys.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here comes your posse, Ben." Jep</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved his gun toward the road as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Bristow charged into the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley on his leathered bay. Behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him dragged the limb of a tree, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches bobbing crazily, and clouds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dust rising from the few remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A violent curse spurted from Ben</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poler's lips and he tried to rise. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry growl rose from his slicks, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they knew it was too late to make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">NOON TOMORROW</seg><seg type="columnLine">was held up by the bar and for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute his cold eyes glared at Jim.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blood was running from the wound</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his heart and his left hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">started up as though to staunch it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But death caught him then and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes dulled and he pitched forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hit on his face. He didn't move</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was a moment's silence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the shock of the noise made by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crashing guns wore off. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monty Ferris ran around the bar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed Jim's hand and shook it</seg><seg type="columnLine">violently. "You did it, kid, you did</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. I thought you were a goner; how</seg><seg type="columnLine">move. Jim Bristow was covering them</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his horse, and Cliff, his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm hanging limp, had made his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">down from the pines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A new calmness showed in Jep's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.

The cards were</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuffled and dealt, all he could do</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as he'd always done, play out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All he'd ever been, from the begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, when he'd been lost from a wag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on-train, was the tool of fate.

They called him evil,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all the West from Dodge City to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Death Valley. But evil was not a word</seg><seg type="columnLine">that applied to him. The fate that</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed him was a brutal thing, cruel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and heartless. Grinnell simply did</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he had to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rode on, his battered horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">plodding head down, into a gray and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shimmering world of sagebrush and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunted jackpines. Far off in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance he could see the blue of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pot-hole lake in a coulee. Water</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't fill the emptiness in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">belly, but it might get some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grime from him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He let the horse drink first, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirsty as it was, it snorted at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brackish alkaline water. Where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny waves of the lake beat against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shore there was a foam like soap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suds. The water would eat the bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a tin cup in a year, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet enough for cattle to drink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was when he rose from dipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face in the lake that he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. It was set back in the wall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grassy chute leading into the coulee</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the prairie above. Its front was</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pine logs daubed with clay and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">back was the wall of the chute. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a dugout, half a house. The logs</seg><seg type="columnLine">were still shiny, reflecting newness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A homesteader's wagon: a big Stude-</seg><seg type="columnLine">baker with a tent built on it, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled to one side.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">homesteader might shoot him on sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he could go no further without</seg><seg type="columnLine">food, even if he had to get it at gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">point.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE WAS a child playing near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wagon, he saw now, and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">obscure impulse made him turn back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the lake and scrub his face in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinging alkali water. He got a broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror and razor from his blanket roll</seg><seg type="columnLine">and set about the painful job of scrap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his face free of the twelve day</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard. There wasn't much he could do</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a face that would scare the</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil himself.

"Nobody</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned me better'n to eat with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife until I was too old to change."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was acutely embarrassed for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason, and wanted to change the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject. "Who is this Bayer?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This land used to be Indian Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve," the woman said. "Bayer used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pay the Indians a dollar an acre to</seg><seg type="columnLine">herd his cattle on here. Now the gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernment has thrown it open for</seg><seg type="columnLine">filing, and Bayer wants to keep it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's brought in all the hardcases they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have run out of Lewiston and Walla</seg><seg type="columnLine">Walla."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"They've got a sheriff in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">county, ain't they?" Grinnell asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sheriff!" she said scornfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bayer's own man. The county com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">missioners are all cattlemen. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old sheriff died the commission-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers appointed this new man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see," Grinnell said. A sheriff was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last man he wanted to see. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose and tilted his hat forward over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes again. He was feeling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old irritation at helpless people who</seg><seg type="columnLine">4S</seg><seg type="columnLine">2-GUN WESTERN</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not believe they were helpless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no hope for these people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lately, in Wyoming, he'd hired out</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gun to the cattlemen fighting back</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wave of settlers. The fight had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloody, and the homesteaders beaten.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here, with a handpicked sheiiff, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">homesteaders had no chance at all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They could not fight the run of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reached in his pocket for a half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagle. He shook his head at the wom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">an's quick protest. "For feeding a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger, even if you was afraid."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy walked to his horse with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Jesse's eyes were on the bone</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle of the pistol. "You like guns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I got a dollar," the boy said. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to sell that gun, mister?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Afraid I couldn't get along with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out it," Grinnell said. "What do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">need a gun for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe the Indians will come</seg><seg type="columnLine">snooping around. I could shoot Bayer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his whole gang of mangy riders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grinnell chuckled. "You save that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight, boy, you may need it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked down at the house when</seg><seg type="columnLine">his horse had climbed to the top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grassy chute. Again he felt irri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated at their helpless stubbornness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bayer and his handpicked riders</seg><seg type="columnLine">would force them to move, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would go on and on, pushed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same bitter fate that pushed him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BY NIGHTFALL he had ridden</seg><seg type="columnLine">several miles to the north without</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing another human being. The des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ert had given way to the deep soil of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Palouse hills and the wild grass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling in the wind, brushed at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hips as he rode through. At sundown</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sage hen ran through the grass be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore him, dragging a wing in imitation</seg><seg type="columnLine">injury. Grinnell took a quick glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">at one of the balls of fluff which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">her chicks, decided they were old</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to fend for themselves, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blew off her head with his forty-four.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before dark he descended to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palouse River, gathered a few limbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and roasted the sage hen on a stick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The meat was tough and stringy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tasted strongly of sage. Supper over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he untied his horses' picket rope from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sage and retied it to his wrist. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he lay with his head on the saddle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">covering himself with the stinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle blanket, and with his pistol in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand, fell into a profound sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was awakened some time later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">about midnight, he judged by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow wheel of stars, to the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half-dozen horses trotting some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where up on the coulee rim. He lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensed, head lifted, with his pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">cocked, until the sound of the horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">died out in the distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He awoke again in the first silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of dawn with the sharp feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">that something had gone wrong. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not move, other than to put his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumb over the pistol hammer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You can quit playing possum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slick. Right now you're cold turkey,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">a faintly amused voice said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grinnell sat up slowly, tilting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun barrel toward the sound of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice as he did so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't try it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grinnell pulled his hand from un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the blanket. "Shorty Morcross,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "Ain't seen you since Wyo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The short man sitting in the saddle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the carbine centered on Grin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nell's chest, grinned with mirth. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">name is Dyke, Ted Dyke, Slick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shorty Morcross never got out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wyoming." He pointed to his chest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ted Dyke is sheriff of Colfax</seg><seg type="columnLine">County."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grinnell shook his head as if to</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear it. "I must be asleep, Shorty. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought you said sheriff." His mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">was busy with the play. If there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">big enough reward posted for him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oregon, Shorty wouldn't waste much</seg><seg type="columnLine">time before shooting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Slick," Shorty said. "You're in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty bad spot."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grinnell said nothing, tensing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles for a try at his gun. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be useless. Shorty was no amateur,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he could put three bullets</seg><seg type="columnLine">through him before he got his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the blanket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Colfax County used to be tough,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shorty said. "Right now they're look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over every strange rider that</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes in. Generally, they issue a</seg><seg type="columnLine">request to keep on riding.'"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grinnell sat straighter, trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">postpone the moment when Shorty</seg><seg type="columnLine">would pull the trigger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Don't reach for that gun, Slick! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">LAST CARD</seg><seg type="columnLine">49</seg><seg type="columnLine">could start even and still beat you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm giving you a good chance. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">might just forget we ever saw each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other before. Your name is maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jake Brown. I can use a good deputy</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a month or so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "New way of livin' for me," Grin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nell said. Relief poured through him</seg><seg type="columnLine">like pure, sweet water. "You got a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodger on me, Mr. Dyke?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. Probably get it a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">days after you ride out. I'm surprised</seg><seg type="columnLine">at you, Slick. In the old days a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't get within a mile of where</seg><seg type="columnLine">you was sleeping."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We all get old," Grinnell said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"For a minute there I thought I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't going to get any older. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">people of this county know what kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of lawdog they got?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shorty smiled his mirthless gri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mace. "Only one person in this county</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose opinion is worth a damn. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">name is Bayer, big rancher. We'll ride</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his ranch on the way to town."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I	never knowed the time you</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed help, Shorty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A man can't have eyes everywhere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These homesteaders will fight for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this rich land. Some of them are</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty tough. You might say you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">insurance for me, just like I'm insur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance for Mr. Bayer. Let's ride, Depu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty."</seg><seg type="columnLine">BAYER'S ranch was on a hill over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking the river. Grinnell, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horses splashed across the shallow</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford, saw a blacksmith hard at work</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the shop, a rifle leaning against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forge. Three men were working at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corral, repairing cinch straps, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind them were three more rifles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">new, from their appearance. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">house itself was set back against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill, and was made of fieldstone heav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily mortared together. The full length</seg><seg type="columnLine">porch commanded a view of the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire valley. Behind the house, up on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rim, more riders were hazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">eome horses. The Bayer's ranch was</seg><seg type="columnLine">set for trouble. It would take a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">army to get at Bayer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the men at the corral had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped hammering rivets into a strap</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was carefully inspecting his rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Shorty and Grinnell rode up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shorty jerked a thumb at Grinnell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"New deputy, name of Jake Brown,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "Parker Nichols, foreman of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Bar B, Jake. Bayer at home?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Up at the cookshack, getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast. If the cook is in a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">mood maybe you can get some grub,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bayer, a heavy, red-faced man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty, was seated alone in the cook-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shack. "Mornin', Sheriff," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Who's your boy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This side of the line his name is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jake Brown."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bayer speared a slice of ham. "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't very pretty. Is he useful?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He'll get the job done."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bayer's cold gaze rested on Grin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nell. "You boys represent the law. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want the homesteaders off the Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strip. I don't want a federal marshal</seg><seg type="columnLine">down here nosing around afterward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If you're wanted in other states, get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the job done and get out of here."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned back to his ham and eggs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"How about some breakfast, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bayer?" Shorty asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Don't anybody ever eat before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they come out here? Plates are on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side table."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grinnell was famished again. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal he had got at the homesteader's</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the sage hen he had eaten the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night before had barely taken a wrin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kle out of his hunger. He loaded a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plate with the ham and eggs and filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mug with coffee from the back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big range. The ham was beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dry out and the eggs were greasy</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold, but he grabbed a knife and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to take the slack from his empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bayer pushed his chair back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood up. Grinnell, stopping to refill</seg><seg type="columnLine">his coffee cup, noted he wore choke-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore riding pants and hand-tooled</seg><seg type="columnLine">boots and that he carried a short-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barreled gun in a specially tailored</seg><seg type="columnLine">hip pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bayer grimaced at Shorty. "Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend may be a curly wolf, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">eats like a hog. Next time, feed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside; he turns my stomach."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shorty laid a lightning-fast hand on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grinnell's arm. "Take it easy, Slio-k,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bayer stared at Grinnell with con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt, but Grinnell could see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous flicker of his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outside they mounted and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">their horses up the valley toward Pal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ouse City. Shorty seemed worried by</seg><seg type="columnLine">50</seg><seg type="columnLine">2-GUN WESTERN</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grinnell's silence. "Hell, I wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">let what Bayer said bother me," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "He's been top dog in this coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try a long time; he just didn't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">who he was talking to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grinnell turned his bleak gaze on</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "Don't worry about Bayer," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "I never kill anybody unless I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid for it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">EARLY EVENING filled the valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">around Palouse City with plum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored light when Grinnell awak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened from an afternoon's sleep. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding into town, he had checked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Shorty's office, and then had bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ded down in one of the bunks in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of the livery barn. Now he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the barber shop and bought a hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">bath in which he soaked the grime</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his body and some of the poison</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the bullet gouge in his side. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound looked purple and poisonous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he should have had a doctor look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. His dirt-encrusted clothing felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange after the bath, so he sent a</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy to the store for new overalls and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shirt. He put them on and had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">close shave and haircut. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sauntered on to supper smelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">strongly of new clothing and bay rum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His steak and apple pie eaten, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back to the courthouse to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port to Shorty. There were two other</seg><seg type="columnLine">deputies: Walters, a blowhard who</seg><seg type="columnLine">would crack in a tight; and a heavy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldered man named Spear, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been the town marshal. A good</seg><seg type="columnLine">man for shouldering drunks out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way, but too slow-witted to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunfighter. Grinnell pegged him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man to rough the homesteaders</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they were in town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's the deal," Shorty said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You, Spear, and Walters patrol the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town. Some of Bayer's riders will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. They'll be tough with homestead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers. Most of the farmers won't fight."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He grinned. "They're married men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with wives and families, they can't af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford to fight. But there are always</seg><seg type="columnLine">one or two young bucks who think</seg><seg type="columnLine">they're tough, or have to impress their</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady friends. Those are the men we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave to Jake Brown. That clear?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The night shadows were as thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">and black as boiled coffee wherever</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yellow lamplight did not reach.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grinnell stolidly walked the length of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street to where the two branches</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of the Palouse flowed together. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">creeks rustled faintly over the stones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was surprised to hear a boom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing rush as of a'waterfall. It took him</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes of listening before he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alized the sound was of the wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing over acres and acres of head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">high grass up on the rim. This Pal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ouse soil, he realized, if it grew grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">that tall, would grow wheat beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">any farmers' wildest dream. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know how long Bayer could hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">back the farmers from the country.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would not be long. It was only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first homesteaders who would suffer;</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who came after would find</seg><seg type="columnLine">courts and churches and impartial</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriffs. It was inevitable, as inevi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">table as the fate which would lead the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolder of them to die in the streets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palouse under his guns. The west-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward settlements were the same al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways, repeated and repeated and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grinnell wheeled and paced up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked street to its final turning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road to Lewiston. It was quiet to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. but tomorrow was Saturday.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The homesteaders and Bayer's hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be in town. Bayer and Shorty</seg><seg type="columnLine">were set for violence, and he was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun in their hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would take a cool hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady nerves. A professional gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighter he did not fear, there it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">question of nerve and hairline guess-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about another man's reactions. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the amateurs he had to worry</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. Some farmer who never before</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a gun in his hands might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky. He went back to the livery</seg><seg type="columnLine">stable and rolled into his bunk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">E AWOKE to a cloudless Satur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day morning with an ache in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his joints and the coppery taste of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fever in his mouth. The ease and well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">being he felt the afternoon before had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left him. His motions were sluggish</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his head ached steadily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He inquired of a boy the where-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abouts of a doctor, and the boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to a house four doors away..</seg><seg type="columnLine">The doctor, an untidy man with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stains of his morning coffee on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirtfront, was seated on the porch</seg><seg type="columnLine">absorbing the sunshine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor took a quick glance at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wounded side, then looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grinnell's eyes and checked his pulse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">LAST CARD</seg><seg type="columnLine">51</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My friend, you're in bad shape,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "You do any more riding with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that wound, and you'll fall off your</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse for good. You better stay here</seg><seg type="columnLine">in town and get yourself a homestead</seg><seg type="columnLine">out on the Indian Strip. You lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">around for a month doing nothing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then you can prove your homestead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You've got a lot of poison in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">system."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is it that easy to get a homestead?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grinnell asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not? This country's got a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great future--a great future. You got</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to see the garden I've planted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">back?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some other time, Doc." Grinnell</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid the doctor his fifty cents. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was remembering the homesteader's</seg><seg type="columnLine">place by the pothole lake. A nice</seg><seg type="columnLine">place to stop and let the rest of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">years run out. A place like that--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">that place, after he and Shorty had</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved the homesteader's family on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As long as Bayer and Shorty were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">power in the country he would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe, and he could help keep them in</seg><seg type="columnLine">power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His headache was worse, he wished</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had dared ask the doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some painkiller, but a dose of</seg><seg type="columnLine">laudanum would make him too slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and draggy for the business at hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took a seat on the bench in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the main store, not far from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitchrack, which was already lined</seg><seg type="columnLine">with horses wearing Bayer's Cross B</seg><seg type="columnLine">brand. Out at the end of the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were three farm wagons, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses unhitched and munching hay</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the wagon boxes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a time Bayer rode into town</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his foreman, Nichols. He tied his</seg><seg type="columnLine">high-stepping Kentucky horse to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitch-rack, took a quick hard look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grinnell, then went across the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Pastime. In three minutes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shorty, the sheriff's star gleaming on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chest, strolled down the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disappeared into the saloon after</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bayer. Further down Grinnell could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see Spear and Walters patrolling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cards were shuffled and dealt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The hand was ready to be played out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The farmers would push into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stacked deck. They would blam« Bay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er and Shorty and Grinnell, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing that they, too, were merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">players uselessly playing the hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">they got.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Near ten o'clock two wagons came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into town from downriver. The first</seg><seg type="columnLine">one held the woman and the boy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jesse, who had fed him by the pothole</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake. The man holding the reins was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall and dark-haired, with bulky</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders and a tough, square set to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his jaw. He drove directly to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitch-rack. He stepped down, untied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bayer's fiddlefooted Kentucky horse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and moved it up the rack to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">room for his team.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The damned fool, Grinnell thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's pushing himself harder than</seg><seg type="columnLine">he has to. If he ran maybe he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">get out of it alive. He's got the wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the boy to think about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But then he thought wearily: What</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference will it make? The pride</seg><seg type="columnLine">would ride with the farmer wherever</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went, and the woman had probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">been attracted to him because of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What had made her a wife might</seg><seg type="columnLine">make her a widow. If not here, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere else.</seg><seg type="columnLine">GRINNELL felt a moment's admir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation for the farmer, then again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pity. No matter how brave a show he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made of it, he was beat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two young farmers, brothers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by their look, in the wagon behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">had driven directly to the hardware</seg><seg type="columnLine">store. One of them held the team</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the other went inside. Grinnell</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Spear and Walters bearing down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the wagon, and the play was clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his mind. He had seen it a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">times before, in a hundred different</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways. Different, but always the same.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bayer must have decided that these</seg><seg type="columnLine">two and the broad-shouldered married</seg><seg type="columnLine">farmer were the kingpins who must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be driven out or killed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spear and Walters wheeled in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cert and sat down on the bench in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of the hardware store. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">farmer, a red-headed, fair-skinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swede, glanced at them, then returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his moody contemplation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From where he sat Grinnell could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hear what Spear and Walters</seg><seg type="columnLine">were saying, but it was apparent they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were enjoying it. The farmer's face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">already sun-reddened, turned a bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarlet. The sound of Spear's un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">melodious bray drifted up the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just as the other brother appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the doorway with a gunny-sack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">52</seg><seg type="columnLine">2-GUN WESTERN</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplies the farmer in the wagon</seg><seg type="columnLine">dived between his feet and came up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a rifle. He was fast, the carbine</seg><seg type="columnLine">was halfway to his shoulder before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spear and Walters could get un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracked. Walters made an ineffective</seg><seg type="columnLine">grab for his gun as Spear bumped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grinnell hurled himself to his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drew his pistol in the same mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. It was an impossibly long shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a pistol, but he sighted and fired.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The shot was high. The heavy slug</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the farmer in the shoulder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked him from the wagon seat. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell between the wagon-box and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel, which saved his life. Walters</seg><seg type="columnLine">had finally got his gun clear of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">holster. Spear had pinioned the arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the brother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold it!" Grinnell shouted. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">plodded down the street to them, feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the steady throb of his fevered</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood behind his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Walters was looking down at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun, a foolish smile on his face. Spear</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked stunned, as if what had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rude game had suddenly exploded be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond belief. The farmer Spear had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed, slammed himself free with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his elbows and went to assist his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a quick rustle of skirts</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the homesteader's wife ran to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Axel! Are you all right?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Axel grimaced from pain. "Smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shoulder."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doctor up the street," Grinnell</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Get your shoulder fixed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">either get out of Colfax County or</seg><seg type="columnLine">go on trial for assaulting a peace</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman turned on him. "So you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are one of Bayer's pet curs! I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorry I wasted food on you the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">day! I should have fed it to the hogs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's no reason for a man like you</seg><seg type="columnLine">living."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grinnell looked at her blankly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shorty strutted over importantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Pastime. "A little trouble,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jake?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our friend went for Spear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Walters with a rifle. I had to cool him</seg><seg type="columnLine">off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shorty looked, not at the brothers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but at the farmer's wife. "We are giv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing you the same orders we give all</seg><seg type="columnLine">troublemakers in Colfax County. Get</seg><seg type="columnLine">your wagon rolling and don't stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">this side of the line."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So that's it," she said. "We move</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, and tomorrow you or some other</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog of Bayer's files on our land. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">bother pretending it's legal? Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">not kill us outright?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lady, you've heard what I have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say," Shorty said. The woman turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, tears streaking the faint layer</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dust on her face. Grinnell, watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her, saw the boy Jesse standing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few feet away, his eyes wide and</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened. Well, it was a tougli world</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the boy might as well learn it now</seg><seg type="columnLine">as later. Jesse reached out and took</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mother's hand as they trailed back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the wagon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grinnell, his head floating from</seg><seg type="columnLine">fever, watched the husband running</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them. The woman went to his arms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the boy Jesse stood close, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding the violence which</seg><seg type="columnLine">outstripped his wildest dreams of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian battles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The farmer finally pushed his wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">away and wheeled toward the Pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. It was then Grinnell saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol stuck in the waistband of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">overalls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bayer and Nichols were watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the saloon door. The last card</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been played, the last part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">design put in.

There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Use that rifle, Slick," Shorty</seg><seg type="columnLine">called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grinnell lifted the rifle, and in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment rebellion overtook him. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his chance to spit in the eye of</seg><seg type="columnLine">destiny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shorty, you always thought you</seg><seg type="columnLine">was faster than me.

This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attack made against Rotten Bel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly's desire, and it is necessary to un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstand the Indians' practice. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brave becomes a war leader, he is</seg><seg type="columnLine">to some extent subject to the wishes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tribe. He may decline to lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">them on some raids, but if the senti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the tribe is strong he cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">so decline without losing face, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">most Indian warriors would go to cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain death rather than lose standing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A band of Crows drove thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses away from the fort, but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not the attacking party. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, it was Crow custom to send</seg><seg type="columnLine">scouting parties ahead when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned a movement of any size, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sure they would not run foul of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Blackfeet, their deadly enemies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therefore, when a second band of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crows appeared, Culbertson knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">squaw's story was about to be borne</seg><seg type="columnLine">out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fort was provisioned.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard was established. Water was</seg><seg type="columnLine">available, and the fort was equipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sustain an indefinite attack against</seg><seg type="columnLine">any number of Indians except for one</seg><seg type="columnLine">item--food. The fort depended pri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marily on wild game for sustenance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in fact one man was hired as post</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunter for this purpose, but game was</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarce in the vicinity, and with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses gone, the amount of meat pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cured by foot-hunters was far less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than needed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In June the Crows appeared. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a camp about 400 yards away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a large contingent, well armed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to the gate and demanded ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mittance.

But Culbertson kept a constant</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard, and the Crows were careful</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to come within range with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fort was almost on the river,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the Crows were watchful; Cul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bertson had a well dug within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stockade so no one would have to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside, for he knew that Rotten Bel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly's people were looking for an excuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">to start an assault in force. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck water ten feet down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their fresh meat lasted two days;</seg><seg type="columnLine">dried meat lasted two days more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the dogs were killed and eaten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally they boiled the parfleches--</seg><seg type="columnLine">containers of raw buffalo hide, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooked up in a mess that resembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">carpenter's glue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now Alexander Harvey, a promi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nent company man, demanded permis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion to shoot the Indians.

Lodge</seg><seg type="columnLine">skins were thrown on the backs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pack horses (the Crows did not use</seg><seg type="columnLine">the travois), and soon the entire vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lage was strung out along the river--</seg><seg type="columnLine">all going upstream away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few of them crossed the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fired some shots at the fort, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">without damage.

And as Ben-</seg><seg type="columnLine">net and Tracy were in on the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal, they had to be dealt with also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About sundown, while Buck Size-</seg><seg type="columnLine">more was having supper at Old Man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willard's, the five man self-appointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">vigilance committee headed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thompson's tent. They met their</seg><seg type="columnLine">man leaving a place where he'd had</seg><seg type="columnLine">supper.

The next bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">came closer, and the gambler, for once</seg><seg type="columnLine">unarmed but defiant, 6neeringly told</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to try again. The third shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck him in the kneecap; he spun</seg><seg type="columnLine">around and fell, but managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawl back to the one-room half-dug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, where the landlady was hiding in</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead of finishing off their vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tim then and there, the posse went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on to Bennet's store. The door was</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked, the building dark, but after</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeated pounding with gun butts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the storekeeper came to the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding a lighted lantern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's up?" he asked shakily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thompson wants to see you," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ed Munger. "He says you're back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trouble over One-eye George."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's mistaken," said Bennet, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll go see him anyway." As he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get his coat and hat, one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men ordered, "You come right now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They tramped down the snowy</seg><seg type="columnLine">street, Bennet hatless and coatless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thumbs (by order) hooked in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">armholes of his vest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the dugout, Thompson was ly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on a cot, his knee swathed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandages. Half-conscious, he opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes and tried to speak. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell back, twenty-three bullets rid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dling his body. Screeching in panic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landlady fled into the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's your turn, Bennet," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Munger. "You deserve to die for</seg><seg type="columnLine">stealing One-eye's claim." A bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed through Bennet's brain. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell dead near the bloodsoaked bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Thompson lay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The posse then rode on to settle</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Tracy. But when they reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">his place, the feed-barn man had his</seg><seg type="columnLine">light buggy hitched up and he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wife were ready to drive off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Halt or we'll shoot," the posse</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted. Bullets whined through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, but Tracy laid the whip to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">team and left on a dead run. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first Kansas town they came to, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">begged for protection, and he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wife slept in the jail that night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Next morning, as Buck stood in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of Old Man Willard's, a wagon</seg><seg type="columnLine">came along, drawn by a yoke of</seg><seg type="columnLine">steers, a boy driving. Two armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">men walked on either side. Ed Mun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger following behind. Seeing two</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, narrow boxes in the wagon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buck called, "If you need help with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grave-digging, I'll come along."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come on," jeered a guard, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll bury you on top of the boxes."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Much obliged," said Buck polite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, "but I've changed my mind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Ed Munger was hanging around</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the feed barn when Buck went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get his pony.

He saddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sorrel and rode away, not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopping at the Wild Horse Saloon</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a parting drink. Mustang looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">more natural, with men going into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saloons, and ponies waiting out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side.

Always taking with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the agility of his lean, supple fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">WESTERN</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers, and the luck that never failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as far as cards were concerned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were the instruments of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">trade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leaning casually against the pol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished bar, he drank his whiskey slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, tasting it. One drink after every</seg><seg type="columnLine">session--that was all he allowed him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. Silent moments dragged by.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was the drone of a fly, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds in the street outside where a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot afternoon sun spilled its heat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Presently the door of Spade</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pierce's office opened and Kelsey</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RANCHER stopped just with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the threshold, stood there star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the room. The handful of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the saloon didn't look at him. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment he came on shuffling feet to</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the cherrywood bar and ordered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink. His voice was hoarse; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared blankly at his own expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the bar mirror while the liquor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured, and threw the drink into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth with a hand that trembled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After that he turned and faced Lew</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hatton. The rasp of his breathing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">audible in the room, as he tried with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out success to check his anger. "All</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, you!" he gritted, blue eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazing out of his homely, brick-red</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. "So it's done! I know how you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped Spade Pierce to rob me, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirty, thieving--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Setting down his own glass, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambler straightened and looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him coldly. His eyes still hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed expression. But the voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">that cut through Kelsey's words had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp edge to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold on!" he snapped. "I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">take that kind of talk from anyone!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll take it from me--because</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's true! My luck couldn't have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">that bad. Not for two weeks straight!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I should have won part of the time--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I would have, if you hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripped the decks and played out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your sleeve every damn chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">you--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's a lie!" Hatton charged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kelsey went light on, hotly, build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into a weak rage. "You led me on!</seg><seg type="columnLine">You milked me clean for Pierce, day</seg><seg type="columnLine">after day--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">A TINHORN CHOOSES HOT LEAD</seg><seg type="columnLine">61</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You led yourself on!" the gambler</seg><seg type="columnLine">amended. "I work here--it's nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me who I play with. I have to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a game for anybody who wants one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But you kept coming back, and every</seg><seg type="columnLine">time you got wilder. You beat your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rancher's face had paled a lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle, and his mouth twisted harshly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Try to talk out of it--go ahead!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why, you filthy tinhorn--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hatton saw it coming a moment in</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance. Lashed by his own words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kelsey suddenly bit them off and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling back into a crouch. His right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand shot downward, came up palm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the rubber butt of a heavy sixgun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lew Hatton couldn't do anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">else in the face of that but defend</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. Seconds after the other start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed his draw, his own hand was mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing--up toward the breast of his coat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sliding in easily toward his armpit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fingers closing around the hideout,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he drew the lean hand out easily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gracefully. The two weapons coughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bullets forth almost at one time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as burnt powder and silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed in again on the tail of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots, Kelsey stumbled. He caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself with one hand gripping the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the bar, hard. Astonishment</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pain washed across his homely</seg><seg type="columnLine">features. The gun slipped from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers with a thud against the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he reached up to claw at his chest</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though he would try to dig out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet that was killing him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he collapsed, dropping in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifeless heap at the foot of the bar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Looking down at him, Hatton</seg><seg type="columnLine">frowned. He hadn't wanted this. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had killed before; and always, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed, in some futile manner. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no reason why Kelsey should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have died. But the rancher had forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hatton looked around at the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the silent room. He saw Spade</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pierce, who had come to the door of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his office at the shooting. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the paunchy figure of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon man, and the evil that lived in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his narrow eyes, the beginning of dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gust tugged at the gambler's mouth...</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then there was a great deal of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusion. Town Marshal Ed Lane came</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurrying in--a small, spare gent in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifties, with thining hair and level</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes that seemed to look right through</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Lips pursed at sight of the dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">man on the floor, he set briskly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. He took a look at Hatton's gun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shot out a rapid fire of questions</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the shooting; everyone who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen it told him that the gambler had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been forced into his part.</seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER a bit, the coroner came in</seg><seg type="columnLine">and took the body away. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently, Hatton found himself alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the marshal in Lane's cubbyhole</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an office, eyeing the back of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little man as the latter stood gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently out the door, pipe smoke curl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing above his thinning hair. Shadows</seg><seg type="columnLine">were long and sharp in the late sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A bad business," said the marshal</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last, with a sigh. "I'd close that Red</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rooster in two minutes if I could."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned, cocked a challenging eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward at the gambler. "Yeah," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">added, "you can tell Pierce I said so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His words irritated Hatton. "Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">look at me," he retorted "I'm new to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this town, and I don't figure to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides in its battles. I draw my pay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that's all I care about."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Lane puffed a cloud of smoke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrugged. "Okay," he said. "But Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kelsey was a good man--hotheaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unreasonable at times, maybe, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's little enough against him. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">made me pretty sick to watch him go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in' back and goin' back to that clip</seg><seg type="columnLine">joint, and losin' his shirt every</seg><seg type="columnLine">time--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The games I deal are square," Hat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton told him, levelly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well, maybe so. But what of it?</seg><seg type="columnLine">That can't make much difference now</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Kelsey--or his womanfolks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hatton looked at the other sharply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What women?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He had a wife and a girl--both as</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine a pair of ladies as I ever knew.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had this little Rafter K spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on Somers' Creek, and they was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mighty happy family--until the Red</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rooster got its claws into Tom!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The marshal glanced into the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, suddenly pointed with his pipe</seg><seg type="columnLine">stem. "You can take a look for your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self!*' he exclaimed. "Somebody's</seg><seg type="columnLine">been and told them what's happened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they're cornin' in now. Take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">62</seg><seg type="columnLine">2-GUN WESTERN</seg><seg type="columnLine">look and see what your cards and bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lets have done."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reluctantly, Lew Hatton went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door and stood there watching as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a buckboard and team tooled into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick dust of Banville's main street.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The younger woman held the reins;</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mother sat beside her, head bowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in crushing grief. Looking at the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the gambler, Ed Lane thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment he saw a shadow there--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hint of self-disgust, or regret for ir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">revocable wrong done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't know," Hatton said, slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. "I didn't know about them--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The marshal only grunted, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">put a lot of meaning into it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Riding beside the buckboard was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man who had gone out to tell Kel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sey's widow and daughter the news.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He happened to glance in the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the marshal's office now as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they rode abreast of it, and caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of Hatton standing in the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At once he leaned and spoke to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women in the buckboard, and both</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted their heads and stared at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambler.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was loathing in their eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Hatton, his face like stone, met</seg><seg type="columnLine">their glances squarely, bearing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brunt of their scorn. He was familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the painted girls of saloon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">honkytonk; he was not prepared for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loveliness he saw now, as the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Tom Kelsey's daughter was turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. Somehow, it tightened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat for an instant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then the buckboard had passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on down the rutted street, leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hatton staring after it from the door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Behind him, the marshal asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly, "Sort of proud of your pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fession right now, Hatton?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gambler jerked around in sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den anger. "That killing wasn't my</seg><seg type="columnLine">fault," he retorted, hotly. "Kelsey</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked the fight, didn't he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lane said nothing; only looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hatton as he dragged another puff of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke out of his pipe. But the gam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bler knew suddenly, as well as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been put in words, what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other was thinking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">HIS FACE darkened with resent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. "All right, say it!" he grit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted. "Cards and liquor and gunplay--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand for those things, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">those things that ruined Tom Kelsey</seg><seg type="columnLine">and finally killed him. That's what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you mean, isn't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The marshal calmly tamped out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe. "You said it pretty well," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered. "An' I reckon the Kelseys</seg><seg type="columnLine">see it the same way." He stuffed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">briar in the pocket of his coat. "Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember this, Hatton! Honest cards</seg><seg type="columnLine">or not--if I ever get the chance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">buck Spade Pierce and close out that</seg><seg type="columnLine">damn Red Rooster place of his, I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">close you out with it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hot with rage. Lew Hatton turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back and strode out of the mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shal's office. Lane had struck very</seg><seg type="columnLine">close, with those few terse words. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride of a gambler, and his anger at</seg><seg type="columnLine">being looked on as a pariah, were sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly very high and strong in him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But what the lawman had said</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled him, too, the more he let his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts work on it. And there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something else. Two women in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">buckboard, looking crushed and alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they drove through Banville's</seg><seg type="columnLine">dusty street. A face, young and</seg><seg type="columnLine">proud and sadly beautiful. ...</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He passed the saloon owner, Spade</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pierce, almost without seeing him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But then, without knowing exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">why he did it, he turned on his heel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and came back a step along the plank</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidewalk, stopping the fat man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just a second, Pierce," he said. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to talk to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The narrow eyes bored into his; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigar wheeled as the other said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yeah?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About the notes Kelsey signed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Now that he's dead, I suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're going to go easy on those,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aren't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pierce studied him coldly. "What's</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to you?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hatton was asking the same ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of himself. He said, "Nothing, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckon. But I was just thinking of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">widow--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the gal, huh?" There was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most an evil sort of humor lurking far</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in the saloon man's piggish eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he said that. He took the soggy butt</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cigar out of his mouth, spat on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sidewalk. "Well," he said, sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisingly, "you can forget about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">notes. I've torn 'em up already."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hatton hadn't expected that. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought it might take some persuad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">A TINHORN CHOOSES HOT LEAD</seg><seg type="columnLine">63</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Now he blinked a little, nodded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Good," he said. "I'm glad you saw it</seg><seg type="columnLine">that way. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he was not quite convinced, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was something in Pierce's man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner that didn't set right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, that seemed to close the</seg><seg type="columnLine">episode of Kelsey's death. Hatton</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back to his work at the saloon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and no one detected any change in</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He was, perhaps, even more close</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouthed and unreadable than before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that in itself wasn't strange.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The front he gave to the world hid</seg><seg type="columnLine">much; and if he suddenly began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find less pleasure in the whisper of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cards, in the clink of chips on</seg><seg type="columnLine">baize-covered tables, he did not show</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. If, in the deep of the night, he sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the edge of his cot in the hotel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoking and staring at nothing, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one knew. For he hardly understood</seg><seg type="columnLine">with any clearness, himself, just what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was happening to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was with strangely mingled feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings of dread and anticipation that, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day of the funeral, Hatton found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in the group that went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand at the grave of the man he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew he wasn't wanted there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He felt the weight of the hostile</seg><seg type="columnLine">glances that ranchers and their wives</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw at him as he stood apart from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest, gaunt and sombre in his dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambler's clothes. Mouth hardening a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little, he ignored them. He knew, sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly, that he was waiting for only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thing, and when it came his heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped and swelled within him until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought it would pound a hole in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One arm around her mother, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl came walking across the clipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass of the crude burial lot. Hatton</seg><seg type="columnLine">had learned her name--Mary. A very</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary name, but somehow filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the honest simplicity that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl herself. She had real strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her. Hatton knew at once that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">first brief glance had not lied to him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looking at her, he told himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitterly, that he was a fool.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THROUGH the brief services he</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched her quietly, drinking in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sight of her. Then the pine box</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffin had been laid away, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first clods of earth dropped in upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. The little group dispersed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl was among the last to leave, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hatton stood at a distance watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">her as she remained arranging the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers she had brought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hat in hand, he walked over to her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She glanced and saw him coming, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once he saw the stiffening of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. Coldly, she rose to face him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not far away, her mother had</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and was staring at him, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Miss Kelsey," he began, "I--just</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to tell you how sorry--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He faltered and stopped. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bitterness and a wall between them</seg><seg type="columnLine">against which his poor words could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not prevail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl said only, "Very well."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hatton fumbled in his pocket and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought out a battered wallet. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked down at the cracked, bulging</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulk of it, and then at Mary Kelsey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I would like to do something," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told her. "I was going to offer money</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you and your mother, but--I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose you wouldn't take it--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are quite right we wouldn't!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she answered, shortly. "And if that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is all you have to say--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The same resentment Marshal Lane</seg><seg type="columnLine">had roused began to stir in him again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're not being fair, Miss Kelsey,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he protested. "I didn't want to do--</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I did the other day. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced on me. I couldn't stand there</seg><seg type="columnLine">and let your father plug me, could I?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You should have!" The loathing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in her gray eyes; her breast rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fell under the black of her mourn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing dress. The mother came a pace</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two nearer; uncertainly. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have died, not him! The mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ey he lost to you was the thing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">put him in a mood for killing. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">goaded him on--and he was the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">to die!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dark thunder swept uncontrollably</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Hatton's face, at that. "I see!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he exclaimed. " 'Plolier than thou.' is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it? Miss Kelsey, I'm not proud</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the work I do; but just because I</seg><seg type="columnLine">make my living out of cards instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of breaking my back in the dirt, I'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">damned if I--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He caught himself suddenly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly his mounting temper cooled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had forgotten where he was; had</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten the silence of the burial lot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the newly covered grave at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">64</seg><seg type="columnLine">2-GUN WESTERN</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. This girl, whose scorn-filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and biting words had lashed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger, was the daughter of the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had just been laid there for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">final rest. The man whom he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Contrition filled him. "Forgive</seg><seg type="columnLine">me!" he pleaded humbly. "I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean--I'm sorry!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She tried to control her voice, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion put a trembling in it. "Are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you finished?" she asked, tensely</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet. "I think you've done quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, Mr. Hatton. You've taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">away my father, and our home--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His head jerked up as he stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. "Your home?" he echoed. "I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose you didn't know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spade Pierce made my father deed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the Rafter K to him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That staggered Hatton. "No!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed. "I swear it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said, "I think he made it con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tingent upon payment of the money</seg><seg type="columnLine">my father owed him.

She turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked away, small shoulders back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">head proudly erect as she took her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother's arm. Hatton was left star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing after them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">HIS RESENTMENT at the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been swept away by the news</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had just given him. Dragging on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hat, he stood there thinking over</seg><seg type="columnLine">this new angle; and slowly his jaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles began to harden into knots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Pierce had lied! He remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">how smoothly the saloon man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him about tearing up Kelsey's</seg><seg type="columnLine">notes. Hatton was just the tool he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to satisfy his greed!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inwardly seething, but with the old,</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly calm showing in his face. Hat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton started down the hill toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunbaked boxes that were the houses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Banville.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he reached the saloon, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">strode on back and looked in Pierce's</seg><seg type="columnLine">office. The fat man wasn't behind his</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk. Hatton slammed the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went over to the bar. "Where's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pierce?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I dunno," the barkeep told him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He went out awhile ago. Took Stew</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bardon and one or two of the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys with him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hatton stopped outside the bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings, looking up and down the sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">smitten road as he built a cigarette</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lighted it. Then he went over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the livery barn and rented a bronc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was a good horseman, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">he seldom rode. Leaving the town be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind him, he struck out across lush</seg><seg type="columnLine">grazing land, browning now under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot summer sun, and sought the wood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed foothills where Pierce's Wigwam</seg><seg type="columnLine">outfit was located. But he never got</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far as the ranch, for as he came out</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a spur he looked down over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning plain and saw three riders</seg><seg type="columnLine">jogging away from there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this distance, through the heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">haze and dust of the valley floor, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't see the trio clearly; but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't have to be told who they were.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pierce, and his gunslinger Bardon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and another. And they were heading</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the direction of the flashing bright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness which was Somers' Creek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Face grim, Hatton ticked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mount's ribs with spur steel and set</seg><seg type="columnLine">it on a course down through the hills.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The leisurely gait Pierce and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others were taking indicated they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were very confident and sure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves; it also gave Hatton time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to beat them to the goal if he hurried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And that was what he did. Using the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spurs, he cut a circle around them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then struck out in a rolling gallop. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had left them far behind when Som-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers' Creek showed ahead, and the tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings that were the Rafter K.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hatton dropped from a saddle into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cloud of dust, and waded through it</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the front door of the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. It was a neat place, with a tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">porch and curtains at the windows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and vines climbing up the wbite wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The door opened as Hatton came up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mary Kelsey faced him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had a rifle in her hands, and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond her Hatton caught a glimpse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mother, face white with grief, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fear at the sight of him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed nothing more to tell him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">these women were alone here, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there would be no one to help</seg><seg type="columnLine">them when Pierce came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the gun made him hesitate. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">A TINHORN CHOOSES HOT LEAD</seg><seg type="columnLine">65</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl said, "All right. You don't need</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come any closer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shook his head. "You won't lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten to me," he told her. "So I'll not</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to talk. But take a look back there</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the trail."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She followed his pointing finger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and caught her breath sharply at what</seg><seg type="columnLine">she saw. "Spade Pierce," she ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. He's coming to take over--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">try it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Her eyes blazed, and her small</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands tightened on the rifle stock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Just let him!" she said, tightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hatton heard the gasp that the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman gave, at that. He said, rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">harshly, "Don't be silly. You're all</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. One woman against the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them. And I think your mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks as though she were going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl turned then to glance at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, alarmed. She freed one hand to</seg><seg type="columnLine">put it on her mother's shoulder. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a simple matter for Hatton to</seg><seg type="columnLine">step to the door and pick the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle out of her other hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">MARY KELSEY tried to take it</seg><seg type="columnLine">back; but he took her arm gently</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forced her into the living room of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little house. "Please," he begged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Look after your mother. I know you</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate me; but let me try and handle</seg><seg type="columnLine">this for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Before she could answer he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside again, closing the door behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The last glimpse he had of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed her gray eyes baffled and an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gry, and yet with a new uncertainty</seg><seg type="columnLine">creeping into them as she stared after</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lew Hatton didn't like a rifle, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">he leaned this one beside the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt instead for the light revolver in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its clip holster under his arm. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, and ready. So he went to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of the little porch and leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">casually against a post with the vines</seg><seg type="columnLine">dripping about his head, and waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Pierce.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fat man was in the center, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a jug headed roan, with squint-eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stew Bardon at his right and another</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunslinger on the other side. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew rein before the house and stayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the saddle, while they eyed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lone man who guarded the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spade Pierce looked suspicious and</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled. "Morning, Hatton," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously. "I didn't figure to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">you here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Don't reckon you did." Hatton</seg><seg type="columnLine">still stood at ease, one shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the post. His face was blank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unreadable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Social call?" the saloon man asked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling him out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The gambler's reply was a slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">shake of the head. He didn't once take</seg><seg type="columnLine">his glance from the eyes of the other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Pierce began to grow nervous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," the saloon man said, "we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">here on business ourselves. If you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">excuse us, we want to talk to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladies--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm settling this affair for them,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hatton answered. He straightened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was suddenly wary, intent. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice cracked out: "Take that phony</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed and turn around and get the hell</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of here, Spade! That goes for</seg><seg type="columnLine">your hired killers, too!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pierce tauted. "Oh, you know about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, eh?" he snarled. "Well, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "--Was bought with gambling debts</seg><seg type="columnLine">--which aren't and never have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">legal!" Hatton finished. "I'm not let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting you collect on it: and I reckon</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know Marshal Lane wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have anything to do with it, either!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thought Spade Pierce was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to explode, then. He saw the two gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men watching their boss, waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">instructions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Damn you, Hatton!" the saloon</seg><seg type="columnLine">man shouted. "Keep your nose out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">other people's business! Get out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that doorway and--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know but what I ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill you, Pierce," said Hatton, quiet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. "I killed Tom Kelsey, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't deserve it any more than you</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. He wouldn't have crowded a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's widow and daughter this way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the very day of the funeral. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't have been such a damn</seg><seg type="columnLine">skunk!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">With a screech of rage, Spade</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pierce suddenly dug for a gun. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fast--faster than Hatton could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have dreamed. The gambler's weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">was barely out of its clip holster when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first bullet crashed into him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That bullet was meant for his heart;</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead, it hit the gunarm that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">66</seg><seg type="columnLine">2-GUN WESTERN</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubled across his chest, and broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. The hideout gun dropped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hatton's numbed fingers and struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor of the porch. And the gam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bler, in the fierce grip of pain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped after it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard Pierce's shout of tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umph, as from a great distance, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the saloon man thought that</seg><seg type="columnLine">slug had killed him. Fire raged</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his shattered arm, gnawed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his brain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">HATTON forced himself up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked and saw the gun he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped lying inches away. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">groped for it with his left hand. Stew</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bardon yelled at his boss as he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the man was still alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next moment a snarling hell of lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">rained down on the neat painted floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the porch. Hatton hoped vaguely</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of those flying slugs would go</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the door, into the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the girl and her mother were.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He got the gun into his fingers as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hot hand of lead touched him in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple of places.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he was answering the fire of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three killers, left-handed. Stew</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bardon screamed and dropped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spade Pierce and the other man</seg><seg type="columnLine">were fighting their lunging horses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had been frightened to a panic</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the racket of the gunfire; Hatton</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that only that fact had saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from their bullets. Carefully, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">propped his elbow against the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath him and drew a line on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon man's bulky frame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Acrid smoke bit into his eyes with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tug of the trigger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">SON OF A GUN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I-Ie barely heard the report.

They had covered forty miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">since daybreak, the better part of it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence. Alec Brendle was a Scotsman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">frugal even with his words, and Don-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nelly had picked up something of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man's habit; but as they turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">their horses up slope toward the trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donnelly put his head back and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">their cabin just ahead. Beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin, still hidden by the trees, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prospect shaft they had gouged</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the rocky slope--the mine that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to make them rich.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's still there, Alec,'' the young-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er man said cheerfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye," said Alec Brendle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the last word he ever spoke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bullet hit the little Scotsman in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chest; it knocked him backward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and out of saddle as his frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse plunged aside.

His horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rearing frantically when hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifles on the hillside slope crashed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second shattering volley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shelter of the trees, and safety,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no more than twenty feet away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there was little Alec Brendle on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground. Deftly the big puncher</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped his carbine from the saddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">boot. Unhesitatingly he quit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunging horse to kneel beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen man. With bullets whining</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead he turned Alec Brendle on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back; he looked at Brendle's face</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw that the little Scotsman was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the need of help. Lead burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">a path of fire across his ribs. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw himself toward the trees a bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let cut his feet out under him and sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">him pitching forward in a headlong</seg><seg type="columnLine">dive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He landed on hands and knees, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">still clutching the short rifle grimly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he crawled toward a snow-covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">piny.on log. Back braced against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">log, safe for the moment, Donnelly</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked up on the damage done. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet had grazed his ribs quite harm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly; a second had struck him in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg, just above the ankle.

Calmly,, dispassionately, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered the situation. Old Alec</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brendle dead, killed by a cowardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet out of ambush. An unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of killers between himself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin.

What</seg><seg type="columnLine">motive might lie behind the treach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erous attack he did not know.

Awk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wardly, but efficiently, he bandaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ankle tightly with strips of cloth</seg><seg type="columnLine">torn from his undershirt; that done,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he set out to locate the men above him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Having lost his hat in his hasty dive</seg><seg type="columnLine">for shelter he was forced to use his</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat as a decoy. It was a good coat, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearskin coat cut hip length for a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who spent time in the saddle. Don-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nelly had killed the bear; he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanned the hide himself, and had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">garment tailored to his own particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">specifications.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Draping the bearskin coat over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrel of his rifle, carefully the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded man hoisted it above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">level of the log. On the hillside a rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack. Donnelly lowered the decoy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He worked patiently, crawling</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the snow, sliding the fur coat</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the snow-covered log. By the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he reached the end of the log</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had drawn half a dozen shots, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a fair picture of the problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of him. Three men on that hill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side slope, he guessed; two hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind rocks close together, the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">in trees and brush some fifty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther up the slope. Already this</seg><seg type="columnLine">third man was working around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hillside to cut behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no pain in the wounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg yet, but the blood in his boot was</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncomfortable and he was dragging a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crimson trail behind him through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow. The situation seemed to call</seg><seg type="columnLine">THROUGH GUNSIGHTS</seg><seg type="columnLine">69</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a flanking maneuver, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">this in mind he turned his back on</seg><seg type="columnLine">those men above him. Like a wounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal slipping away from the hunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er's gun he crawled through tunnels</seg><seg type="columnLine">between snow-laden clumps of brush,</seg><seg type="columnLine">using each bit of cover, each slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">depression on the hillside slope to aid</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on his way. He got away without</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shot being fired; two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards and he was deep in brush and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, and he pulled himself erect then</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tried his weight on the bullet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torn leg. And gasped at the sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabbing pain that ran through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, knowing then that the bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shattered a bone. Donnelly's lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightened in a twisted grin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nice," he muttered. "Very nice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed."</seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH NO knowledge of when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first of that killer pack might</seg><seg type="columnLine">break through the trees, calmly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">took time out to make a pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">crutches. They were nothing fancy;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were two cedar branches hacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">off with a pocketknife, with limb</seg><seg type="columnLine">crotches to serve as arm rests, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donnelly tried them in a few hobbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps and found they would suffice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He went on awkwardly, slipping and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sliding on the frozen slope, stumbling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling, climbing to his feet again, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">always working deeper into the trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he pushed steadily up the slope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How long it took to reach the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ridge Rod Donnelly didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. On crutches it was a heart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking chore; but reach the top he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did; and once across the ridge abrupt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly he changed directions, pointing up</seg><seg type="columnLine">canyon in a course which would lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to the cabin. For the moment he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had slipped away from his attackers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How long his luck would hold he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know. In this game of life and</seg><seg type="columnLine">death he was terribly handicapped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he had also one slight advantage;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew each foot of this lonely</seg><seg type="columnLine">country as a man might know his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">back yard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two hundred yards up canyon he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut back toward the top of the ridge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Discarding the crutches temporarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">he crawled through snow on hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knees, shoving the rifle before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Atop the ridge he lay flat, sweep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the wintry waste below in slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and careful inspection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He located one man first, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">another. They were far below, mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurs of color against a white back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, moving cautiously from tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tree as they sought to locate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who had slipped away from them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If there was a third one in the party</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rod Donnelly could not find him, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he gave ten minutes to the ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"He's gone ahead," he decided.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's worked around the point."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having placed the missing member</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the murder pack to his own satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faction Donnelly faced another prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lem. Both men below were within</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle range but as a shot would be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gamble, and with his crippled leg the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowpuncher didn't feel like trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">slip closer to the pair. And a shot now</seg><seg type="columnLine">would reveal his position, undo all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage gained by the heart-break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing effort on the crutches. He was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">very far from the cabin. .. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The sound of a snapping stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked Donnelly around, froze him</seg><seg type="columnLine">into sudden rigidity there on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frozen ground. Off to his left and</seg><seg type="columnLine">below him a man had come suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into view from behind a snow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanketed clump of brush, a man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been resting there through</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the time that Donnelly had</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to locate him. In corduroys and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy sheepskin coat, with a rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging in his hand, he was pushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way slowly up the slope. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so close that Donnelly could hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crusted snow crunching beneath his</seg><seg type="columnLine">boots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Donnelly's lips moved sound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly. "Galt!" he said. "Dave Galt!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dave Galt he knew quite well. Galt</seg><seg type="columnLine">owned a little one-cow spread beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountain. Also, he owned a pack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hunting dogs, and in spare time</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galt had built a rep hunting mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions. More than once, on the trail of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big cat, he had stayed overnight at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin with Donnelly and little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alec Brendle. That now Galt should</seg><seg type="columnLine">reveal himself as one of the men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ambushed little Alec and himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">was for an instant unbelievable to big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rod Donnelly; and then, suddenly, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not surprising at aU. He could re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member nights when that dark and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sullen man had sat around the cabin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">asking questions about the mine the</seg><seg type="columnLine">70</seg><seg type="columnLine">2-GUN WESTERN</seg><seg type="columnLine">while his beady eyes moved restlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">missing nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dave Galt had reached the top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ridge. He went down on hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knees; he crawled forward push-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the rifle ahead of him, scanning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snow-filled canyon below with</seg><seg type="columnLine">alert and wary eyes. Quite evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had guessed that Donnelly might</seg><seg type="columnLine">double back up-trail. He wasn't fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards from Donnelly, but Donnelly</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beyond him on the ridge and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galt's attention was directed the oth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And slowly, carefully, Donnelly</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked the thirty-thirty carbine</seg><seg type="columnLine">around and laid the barrel across a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow-crusted rock. He knew this man</seg><seg type="columnLine">he dealt with; even before today's</seg><seg type="columnLine">events; he'd known that Dave Galt</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a dangerous man. Galt was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawled flat now. head and shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, his body hidden by brush. Don-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nelly could see his tight fitting fur</seg><seg type="columnLine">cap, the collar of the sheepskin coat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He drew a careful bead, his finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">closing down on the trigger. He hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, as though warned by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some subtle sixth sense, Dave Galt</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned his head slowly and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight into Donnelly's eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a queer thing. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">this moment when these two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at one another across fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards of space-- Dave Galt, caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">off guard, helpless, looking down a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright and shining barrel into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes of a man he'd planned to kill--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rod Donnelly, squinting through</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun-sights at one of the murder pack</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had done for Alec Brendle, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger tightening on the trigger for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shot that would send a bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashing through Dave Galt's head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">AND NOTHING happened. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer, even to Donnelly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't pull the trigger. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't add that ultimate ounce of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure which would smash a thirty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty bullet between Galt's staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. It wasn't sympathy, compassion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt; in Donnelly's mind was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">question but that Galt was the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsible for Alec Brendle's death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was something fundamental; some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing buried deep in Donnelly him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. He wasn't a killer, it seemed. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't kill a man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the big puncher's finger was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still tugging at the trigger, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still staring at Galt through rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">sights, when suddenly the other man</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke the spell. Dave Galt spun like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">big cat in the snow to fling himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind a pile of snow-covered rocks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardly had he disappeared when his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle crashed, one shot and another</seg><seg type="columnLine">and another, the bullets kicking up</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffs of snow around Rod Donnelly's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Donnelly had ducked back auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matically. He lay sprawled in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow, thinking of that priceless</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance he had let slip through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers--the chance to pay off one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alec Brendle's killers with hot lead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He said disgustedly: "I'm damned!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buck fever!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pain from the bullet-shattered leg</seg><seg type="columnLine">throbbed through his body. Face</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in snow, he cursed the chicken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearted softness which had caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to spare Galt's life, knowing quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">well that he might pay dearly for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant of weakness before this game</seg><seg type="columnLine">was over. Granted a similar chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would be no hesitation on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of Galt, or of that pair who</seg><seg type="columnLine">travelled with him. Old Alec, dead on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a snow-filled flat below, offered mute</seg><seg type="columnLine">testimony on that point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was too late for regrets. Galt had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducked from sight. Galt was on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the ridge now, Donnelly on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. The puncher twisted in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow, gun held on the spot where Galt</seg><seg type="columnLine">had disappeared. He gained a glimpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Galt's fur cap above a rock; he trig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered a hasty shot and the cap pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of sight. He knew that Galt had</seg><seg type="columnLine">held it up to draw his fire. A second</seg><seg type="columnLine">later Galt fired twice, the slugs whin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing harmlessly overhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then it was that Donnelly got an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other shock. He had known that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg was bleeding, but he was not pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared for the widening crimson circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the snow where his foot had rested.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That much blood meant that the bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have severed an artery in his leg.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Already he had lost more blood than</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could conveniently spare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He threw a shot down slope in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galt's direction, not bothering to aim.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, swiftly, he went to work on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ankle. With his bandanna handker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief he rigged a tourniquet above</seg><seg type="columnLine">THROUGH GUNSiGHTS</seg><seg type="columnLine">71</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blood-soaked bandage, twisting it</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight and tighter with a stick, setting</seg><seg type="columnLine">his jaw against the pain that rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him as he lashed the stick itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his leg. It was done at last,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then, slowly, cautiously, crawling</seg><seg type="columnLine">from bush to rock, from rock to snow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered bush, he worked his way back</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the ridge away from Galt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Knowing each foot of this country</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew exactly the point at which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having left Galt behind on the thick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly-wooded hillside, he had to cross the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge to drop down on the cabin from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear. He persevered grimly, push-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his rifle ahead and dragging his</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless leg behind, dropping down</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope with agonizing slowness toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin. The crutches he had aban-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a small space of level</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground at the bottom of the slope. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed it on hands and knees, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecting each instant to hear the blast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing roar of guns from the hillside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing happened; he pulled up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadow of the cabin wall without</seg><seg type="columnLine">event. The cabin had one door, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front; there was a window at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, on hinges and fortunately un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked. He shoved the window open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoisted his body over the sill, crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inside, he managed to get his one</seg><seg type="columnLine">good leg under him and pulled himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">erect. He hopped through to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kitchen. There was a fire in the range,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on the oilcloth-covered table were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirty dishes which had not been there</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he and Alec had left the cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">two days before. Outside the kitchen</seg><seg type="columnLine">window he could see a path already</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-broken through the new snow</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading to the tar-paper shack which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had served Alec and himself as com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bination stable and blacksmith shop.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That Galt and his men had spent time</seg><seg type="columnLine">here was evident, but now Donnelly</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see no sign of any of them about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">ON A CORNER of the kitchen</seg><seg type="columnLine">table Donnelly assembled a miscel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lany of instruments and material: a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colt sixgun, a pocket-knife, a quart</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle of whiskey, a package of absorb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent cotton, and strips of white cloth</seg><seg type="columnLine">for bandages. Aware that he might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrupted any moment he lost no</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Already the tourniquet on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg was biting into flesh; he set his</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaw and hooked it up another notch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He cut the blood-soaked bandage</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his ankle and soaked the leg</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberally with whiskey. The bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone through neatly, in and out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the wound he rammed plugs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">absorbent cotton soaked in whiskey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">closing his teeth against the pain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushing the plugs solidly into place</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a match stick. He sloshed more</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiskey on the leg, wrapped it</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly with layer after layer of ban-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dage. That done, he removed the tour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">niquet and wrapped leg and foot in</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide strips torn from a blanket. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">makeshift medicine, the best he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">manage under the circumstances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was finished barely in time. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had just finished tying the blanket-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandage in place when he lifted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head to see men and horses coming up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trail toward the cabin. Three men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with two saddled horses; and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donnelly saw that Galt and his crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">had caught up old Alec's horse and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own. Their thought was plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough; in this lonely wasteland a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded man on foot would be in des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perate plight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three men came on carelesslv,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dave Galt in front, and behind Galt</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men leading the captured horses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donnelly recognized them both; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall one was Pete Duchelle, the short-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er one Clint Abad; both worked for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dave Galt's K Bar outfit beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain. Knowing them onlv slight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, Donnelly knew them well enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know that both were tough hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reached for his rifle, resting</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the table. By the time he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun the men with the horses had</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned aside toward the stable and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galt was coming up the trail alone. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">came on, striding carelessly, a big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hook-nosed man in levis and sheen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin coat. Sixgun in hand Rod Don-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nelly worked his way along the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stand quietly just inside the cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The door shoved open. Galt was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming through the doorway when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donnelly stabbed him with the Colt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lift 'em, Galt!" he snapped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the space of a single heartbeat</seg><seg type="columnLine">big, hook-nosed Dave Galt stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">2-GUN WESTERN</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in stunned surprise. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved like a striking snake. One hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">pawed out in a lightning thrust to</seg><seg type="columnLine">knock the gun aside. Galt's body</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted, and his big shoulders pinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donnelly back against the wall. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand found Donnelly's throat. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other Galt was grabbing for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixgun when Rod Donnelly shoved</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear of the wall and smashed the bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rell of the gun against Galt's head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That single stunning blow checked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fury of Galt's attack, drove the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hook-nosed man back on his heels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With only one good leg under him</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donnelly grabbed Galt around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck: he held with one hand while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought the sixgun crashing down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galt's head in a terrific blow that sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galt toppling backward through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open cabin door. Donnelly sprawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">on top of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dave Galt was spread-eagled in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow, unconscious. Donnelly pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his knees, and a gun roared, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big puncher looked up to see Pete</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duchelle, rifle in his hand, taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful aim for a second shot from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door of the blacksmith shop. He threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself aside as the gun exploded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he heard the bullet thud into log</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls at his back. With his sixgun he</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw two shots at Duchelle and drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man back inside the blacksmith</seg><seg type="columnLine">shop. Grabbing Dave Galt by the col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar he dragged the hook-nosed man</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There, watching meanwhile through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window, he bound Galt hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dave Galt rolled over. For an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant the beady black eyes he fixed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donnelly were filled with puzzle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. Donnelly was sprawled on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor by the window, watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacksmith shop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"For a wounded gent you get</seg><seg type="columnLine">around fast," the hook-nosed man</seg><seg type="columnLine">growled suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wriggled into a more comfort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able position. "I could use a smoke.''</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You could?" said Donnelly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled a cigarette, lit it, drank in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lungful of smoke. "I could use some</seg><seg type="columnLine">information, Galt. What in hell was</seg><seg type="columnLine">your idea, killing Alec?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Galt regarded him unblinkingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Figured the mine was worth it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donnelly stared at him. "The mine's</seg><seg type="columnLine">recorded. You couldn t jump it--you</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't get away with it if you killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">both of us--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Figgered to kill both of you,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated Galt brazenly. "Mebbe, though,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wasn't figgering to jump the mine."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What was it, then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Galt's thin lips curled mockingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Roll me a smoke and I'll tell you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEYOND the cabin, from the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the blacksmith shop, a gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared once, and window glass shat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered on the floor and the slug crashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into pans behind the stove. Donnelly</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced out casually. He rolled a cig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arette and leaned over to shove it be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the lips of the bound man on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor. He held a match while Galt</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffed contentedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was a tip I got," said Galt.

His first thought had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the killing of Alec Brendle had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been brutally purposeless; he saw now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the crime, his own murder as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, had been planned by a cold and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruthless brain. Dave Galt had guessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">correctly when he guessed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two partners had hit upon high-grade</seg><seg type="columnLine">ore. And. during the long winter</seg><seg type="columnLine">months, the three killers could quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily have cleaned out that pocket.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They could have been gone with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring thaws, leaving behind no rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ord of their crime. If, later, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">cared to come back and file claim to</seg><seg type="columnLine">THROUGH GUNSIGHTS</seg><seg type="columnLine">73</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mine, there would be none to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pute their ownership.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You hit it right, Galt," Rod Don-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nelly said slowly. "We found a pock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">et, Alec and me. Quartz you can crum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble in your fingers, rotten with gold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's up there now--and you'll never</seg><seg type="columnLine">get it. Some of it will buy drinks for</seg><seg type="columnLine">San Lorenzo the day you hang."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dave Galt expelled a thin stream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue smoke. "Mebbe," he said hardily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I ain't on the gallows yet.

"With Alec</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brendle dead down on the flat?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">jeered. "With them knowing they got</seg><seg type="columnLine">a murder charge to face if you get out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of here alive? Don't fool yourself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donnelly. Those gents will camp right</seg><seg type="columnLine">here till your hide's nailed on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, deep in his heart. Rod Donnel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly had no choise but to agree with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooked-nose killer on the floor. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">odds were two to one against him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">More, the scales were tipped in anoth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er way: he was crippled: he had lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">more blood than he could afford; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew in a few hours more or less</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fever would be rushing through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his veins. He knew that then he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be in no shape to deal with those kil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lers beyond the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They got the horses," Galt said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't reckon you'll try to hop to</seg><seg type="columnLine">town on one foot. And you got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep sometime. This is a finish fight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donnelly, and you're still a hell of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long ways from San Lorenzo."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A finish fight!

Don-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nelly could see that now, very clearly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stretched out beside the window, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded leg on fire, he watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the chance of a surprise at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack by that pair camped in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacksmith shop. But probably they</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't attack; probably they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be content to wait. They could af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford to wait. In this empty, snow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled wasteland there was no need</seg><seg type="columnLine">for haste.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You had your chance to kill me</seg><seg type="columnLine">once today," said Galt suddenly. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">had me dead center in rifle sights.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why didn't you squeeze trigger?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe I was saving you for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallows, Galt?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hell!" said the hook-nosed man</seg><seg type="columnLine">scornfully. "You didn't have the guts</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shoot! I've known gents like that</seg><seg type="columnLine">before now--gents packing a gun they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were afraid to use. It takes nerve to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill a man, Donnelly--even a man you</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate. Mebbe you didn't know that be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore today."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donnelly looked up. "You got</seg><seg type="columnLine">that kind of nerve, Galt."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," said Galt. "It was my slug</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed Alec Brendle. Why should I</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie now? You had your chance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">square it and you couldn't pull the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trigger." He grinned wickedly. "Meb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">be it was Bible stuff. Thou shalt not</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill, eh, Donnelly? Mebbe that's why</seg><seg type="columnLine">you held your fire?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe," said Donnelly. He crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the kitchen to stoke the</seg><seg type="columnLine">range with clumps of p i n y o n</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood. He piled the firebox full, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled on to close the door between</seg><seg type="columnLine">kitchen and bedroom, and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to take his position at the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow. Pain moved along his leg in</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife-thrusts of agony. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still no sign of activity from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacksmith shop. Those men could</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait. He couldn't. He had to bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">this to a boil--had to end it quickly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one way or another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heat from the blazing stove spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and filled the tiny rom. Dave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galt wriggled in his sheepskin coat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perspiration flowing down his lean</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You trying to roast us Donnelly?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he snarled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take off the coat," said Rod.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With my hands tied behind me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Donnelly moved around him. "I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">untie you long enough to slide out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coat," he said. "Don't try any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, Galt. Maybe I ain't got nerve</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to kill a man, but sure as hell</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll knock your skull loose from your</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders if you make one funny</seg><seg type="columnLine">move!''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He untied Galt's wrists, waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the hook-nosed man wriggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the sheepskin coat, tied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrists again. His gun was in Galt's</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, but the other submitted without</seg><seg type="columnLine">protest.

Rod Donnelly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawled by his window, thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. Remembering how his partner-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship with Alec Brendle had begun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, he rolled over, shoved</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin door wide open. A lead slug</seg><seg type="columnLine">sliced slivera from the door jamb. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at hook-nosed Galt. "We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be going now," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Going!" echoed Galt. He stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Donnelly. "You aiming to crow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hop to town Donnelly?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I got a better way," said Donnelly</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtly. He reached for a strip of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torn blanket on the floor. "I'll have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">blindfold you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Blindfold me?" said Galt. For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time a trace of uneasines was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the tone of the hooked-nosed man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What you figgering to do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Donnelly's face was a bleak mask.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It will be revealed," he said, "Hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">still or I'll cave your head in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tightly he fixed the blindfold</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the bound man's eyes. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly all of Dave Galt's harsh as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">surance was gone. There was the be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning of panic in Galt's voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You aiming to use me for a shield,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donnelly?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Donnelly cut the ropes binding his</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs. "Stand up," he said. "It's cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">out--you'll want a coat."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What you planning, Donnelly?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Listen, Galt. I'm going to untie</seg><seg type="columnLine">your hands now. Just long enough for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to crawl into your coat.

He slapped a Stetson on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galt's head. "Your hat's outside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You'll have to wear one of mine."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galt spoke earnestly. "Pete Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chelle and Clint Abad are out there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donnelly. Both of them jaspers know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to shoot.

He knew now that there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat," said Donnelly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">chink in Galt's armor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">HE TURNED, awkward on the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">good leg. And in that instant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly, Dave Galt made his play.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dave Galt, whose eyes were blind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">folded now but whose hands were</seg><seg type="columnLine">free, lifted a hand in lightning move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and jerked the blindfold from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes. For a fraction of a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big man stood balanced on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">toes. Rod Donnelly was in the act of</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching for a hat hanging from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooden peg in the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a flash the hook-nosed killer saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">his opportunity; just as swiftly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped i^. His hands were free now;</seg><seg type="columnLine">so were his feet. The blindfold was</seg><seg type="columnLine">torn from his eyes. Weaponless, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashed out savagely at Donnelly's jaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his fist. He missed the jaw; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow struck Donnelly's shoulder; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it knocked the one-legged man off</seg><seg type="columnLine">balance and sent him spinning to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. He landed on his hips, gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifting. Too late. Dave Galt was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready at the door. Donnelly threw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot at him, but Galt was through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. Galt was outside, running--</seg><seg type="columnLine">with desperate speed to beat a bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, as suddenly aa it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">started, it was over. Dave Galt, head</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, was racing toward the black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">smith shop. His whole concern was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to escape a bullet from Donnelly's gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so he was quite unprepared for</seg><seg type="columnLine">what occurred--for the crashing roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">of guns from the blacksmith shop, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the bullets that met him before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had covered half a dozen yards. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the hook-nosed killer, one bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let and another; they stopped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head-long rush and propped him up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">right for a moment, and then Galt's</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees caved under him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rod Donnelly had crawled to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window. From the window he watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blacksmith shop. He saw the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the shop swing open, saw two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">step outside. A tall man and a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, they trudged across the snow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered ground toward the cabin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each man carried a rifle. The tall man</seg><seg type="columnLine">said something to the short man. Both</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed. They came on. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost reached that twisted figure in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snow when Donnelly rolled over</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the doorway. Donnelly edged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty-thirty through the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get 'em up! he rasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And both men stopped. Pete Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THROUGH GUNSIGHTS</seg><seg type="columnLine">75</seg><seg type="columnLine">chelle and Clint Abad.

Then Lanky Pete</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duchelle looked down at the figure in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's Dave," he said stupidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The words seemed to break a spell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clint Abad flung himself aside, trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately to swing his rifle into</seg><seg type="columnLine">line. The rifle barked from the cabin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Abad went down, his gun unfired.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pete Duchelle managed to get in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot, firing his rifle from the hip. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">slug kicked up snow a foot in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin doorway. Rod Donnelly took</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliberate aim. His bullet hit Duchelle</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the center of the chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rod Donnelly watched Duchelle go</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. He lowered the rifle slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not a killer, he thought. He'd been</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to shoot a little time back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he'd had Dave Galt helpless un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der his gun. Now, with two killers</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to get guns into action, he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no trouble squeezing trigger. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hard to understand. He let it go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It wasn't over yet.

He did not live to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear the death knell of his revolving-</seg><seg type="columnLine">breech rifle.

Pete Duchelle</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dead in the snow. So was Dave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galt.

Doc</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrugged back. So Barney left and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doc walked with him as far as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. "Maybe when the shock has</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn off he'll remember something</seg><seg type="columnLine">else. Barney," said Doc. "If he does,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll let you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Barney Carr walked slowly back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his office. Down street the stage</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in front of the livery barn. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">grizzled old law man had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked that over, along with the bod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ies of Jim Dykes, the driver, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shove Macklin, the shotgun guard. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">76</seg><seg type="columnLine">BLOOD AND SWEAT - OR &amp;ULLETS?</seg><seg type="columnLine">77</seg><seg type="columnLine">much for visual evidence. Now he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to think.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There would be a lot of bumble-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads thinking about this too, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flected Barney grimly--and probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumping at conclusions, like they al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways did. And the usual criticism</seg><seg type="columnLine">would begin to be whispered about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That Barney Carr had been a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff, but was getting a little old</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the job now. That he spent too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much time sitting around his office</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not enough in the saddle. That if</seg><seg type="columnLine">Longhorn County had a younger</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff with plenty of 'git-up-and-</seg><seg type="columnLine">git' to him, this sort of murder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">banditry would not take place. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">when next election time rolled around</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might be a good idea if folks</seg><seg type="columnLine">started voting with their heads and</seg><seg type="columnLine">not with their hearts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney had heard it all before. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">took place every time any sort of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">major crime hit the county. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who did most of the criticising</seg><seg type="columnLine">neglected entirely to keep track of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the subsequent arrests and convic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, which, Barney reflected with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim and sober pride, had been well</seg><seg type="columnLine">nigh perfect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And when they started talking a</seg><seg type="columnLine">younger man for Barney's' office, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name most often mentioned was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Ed Dow. That was all right with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney, for Ed was a good boy. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">his daddy had been, old Grizzly Dow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid of nothing under the sun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strong and rugged, Ed could ride five</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses into the ground and come up</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling. A better than average hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a gun and a good head on him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But a little too chock full of the bust</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em wide open spirit of ebullient</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth. Which led him to jump at con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusions a little too readily. Given</seg><seg type="columnLine">time and the right sort of training,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ed would make a right smart law</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">That was why Barney had hired</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ed on as deputy, though there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty who said at the time that Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney Carr had pinned a deputy's star</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Ed Dow to move competition from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the field. The fools! Couldn't they get</seg><seg type="columnLine">it through their thick heads that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good law man had to be trained, same</seg><seg type="columnLine">as for any other profession? That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trouble in a lot of counties. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">elected a backslapper, a gent with</seg><seg type="columnLine">swagger and big mouth--and nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">else. Then wondered why so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">crime danced loose and free across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the range.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, Ed Dow was out with a posse</seg><seg type="columnLine">now at the scene of the hold-up, try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to pick up a trail and run it down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe it would all turn out that sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple. Once in a while it did. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney figured this case as being a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little different. There were certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">angles about it which needed think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over. And Barney Carr was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his office, thinking over those an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gles when Ed Dow and the posses</seg><seg type="columnLine">came clattering back into Prairie</seg><seg type="columnLine">City, just at sundown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ed reported immediately, his wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldered, dusty figure filling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway as he came in, chaps swish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, spurs clashing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No luck, chief," he reported suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cinctly. "There was a trail--two men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We followed it clear back into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cutbank country. They split up there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one going east, one west. I sent Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garson and half the posse along one</seg><seg type="columnLine">set of tracks while me and the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boys followed the other. My set</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended up in Whit Horse Creek and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom's ran out in the Hardin Valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail. Both broncs were bare-foot with</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing about 'em to tell off from any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other set of bare foot bronc tracks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All we could go on was the orginal</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of the getaway trail, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was back into Cutbank. That set Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">and some of the boys to wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">about--well, they mentioned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">names of Buck Caspian and Milo</seg><seg type="columnLine">Studinger."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you think, kid?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney Car quietly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">pD DOW spread his long length in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chair and built a smoke. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirred a little restlessly. "Well," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurted finally--"Caspian and Stud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inger both got records. They both did</seg><seg type="columnLine">time for this same sort of thing--</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage robbery. And I've heard my old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dad say that a sheep killin' dog never</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets over his taste fur mutton."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney Carr nodded slowly. "Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in what you say. I'm going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rustle a bite of supper and ride out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have a talk with Buck and Milo.'*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll jog along," said Ed Dow. '</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Them two jaspers gone bad again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'd know right off what you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding in for and they'd smoke you</seg><seg type="columnLine">down without giving you a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">73</seg><seg type="columnLine">2-GUN WESTERN</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance for your alley. I'll go along to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep an eye..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said Barney Carr. "You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">staying right here in the office, kid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Your job will be to keep the fur</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoothed down on the wise ones.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They'll be drifting in after supper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell you what I should have done,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hand out advice that nobody wants</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that ain't worth a damn nohow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And to criticise; that's the best thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">they do is criticise. You listen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll get a couple of ear-fuls. But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">all comes under the head of expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rience.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was near midnight when Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney Carr got back to Prairie City. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">light was still going in the office and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Barney went in he found Ed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dow waiting for him. Young Ed was</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking a little sullen. After one</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift glance at his deputy, Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled slightly. "They must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">rawhiding you and me pretty heavy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">kid. Let's hear about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Rawhiding is a mild word,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">growled Ed Dow. "Chet Shadrow was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in and fit to be tied. He'd been over at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stone Corral setting up a way station</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the projected stage line he aims</seg><seg type="columnLine">to run into Baker Valley. He didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know a thing about the hold-up until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he got back to town. And then he hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, raving. Vinson was down from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mines and demanding action of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some kind or another. For do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what them damned holdup</seg><seg type="columnLine">got off the stage? They got the mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">payroll, that's what they got. Close on</seg><seg type="columnLine">to twelve thousand dollars. Vinson</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the mine owners are going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">yell bloody murder, and as Superin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendent, he's going to be on the spot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shadrow is howling because this is</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to be a black mark against his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage line, besides losing his best</seg><seg type="columnLine">driver and shotgun guard. They're go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to raise hell and put a rock under</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, them two are, if we don't get some</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of results and get 'em in a hurry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I don't know as you can blame</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em. In their place, I'd feel the same."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney Carr got out his old pipe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuffed it and puffed it aglow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Along with all their howling, did</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have any suggestions?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">mildly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ed Dow's tone grew a little de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiant. "Everybody who was in seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be thinking along the same line.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buck Caspian and Milo Studinger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Did you see them two?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yep. Spent the evening with 'em.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They're like a pair of tickled kids.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They been digging a well up on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry Bald Knob range of theirs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they hit a swell flow of good water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That means they can graze that chunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">of range the year round now, instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of just in the spring. They aim to</seg><seg type="columnLine">put in a wind mill and a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">concrete water troughs. Opening up</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Bald Knob range to year round</seg><seg type="columnLine">grazing means they can put some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bottom range into alfalfa.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Darned smart, progressive cattlemen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">them two boys."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ed Dow got abruptly to his feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm going to turn in," he growled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," said Barney Carr. "G'night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">kid."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ed Dow slammed the door behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as he went out. Old Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled grimly. "Think I'm a simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded old fool, don't you, kid?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmured. "Well, youth has to learn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I reckon."</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARNEY spent the balance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night on the office bunk and met</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ed Dow at breakfast in the hash</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. Ed was still sulky, curt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncommunicative. While they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">eating, Chet Shadrow came in, growl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing behind his black, bristly beard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wondering when I'd get a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to talk to you, Carr," he snapped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What you aiming to do about that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold-up?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, try and run down the trail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course. Golly! The cook sure got</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good brew on the java this morning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tie into a cup or two, Chet. Cheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">you up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shadrow cursed, grabbed Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carr by the arm and jerked him</seg><seg type="columnLine">around. "Listen here, you simple old</seg><seg type="columnLine">coot," he growled. "You act like that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold-up was a joke. Well, it ain't.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two good men were killed, Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dykes and Shove Macklin. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">drummer nearly got his, too. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine payroll was lifted. It is all a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy jolt against my stageline. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't see it as any joke. Neither does</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stent Vinson, the mine superinten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent. Neither does anybody else</seg><seg type="columnLine">around here who believes in law and</seg><seg type="columnLine">order.

Well, get this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">straight. We want some action on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this thing. If you can't get it, we'll</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">put that star of yours on somebody</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">else who will."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Barney Carr blinked. "I aim to get</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> some action, Chet--soon as I know</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> where the trail leads."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Why don"t you try the trail that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> leads out to the Circle C S?" sneered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shadrow. "I've heard it said that Buck</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Caspian and Milo Studinger have had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> experience at robbing stages in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> past."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Mebbe so," murmured Barney</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Carr. "But that was in the past. I'd</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">say those boys were pretty good citi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">zens, now.

"That's their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> privilege. Well--I got to be going.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pour your troubles on Ed. He's got</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> young shoulders and broad ones. You</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> stick around, Ed. I got some riding</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to do. Don't know when I'll be back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sheriff Barney Carr was gone from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Prairie City for two whole days and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> nights and during that time he put</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> in a heap of riding. He circled almost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> as far out as Baker Valley, came back</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> through the Cut Bank country, hit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the mines on Rawhide Peak where he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> had a talk with Vinson, the superin-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tendent, then went back to Cut Bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hit White Horse Creek and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardin Valley trail, riding circle af-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ter circle, his weather-puckered eyes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> full of earth-searching scrutiny and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> remote, gathering thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   He lived off a box of crackers and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a chunk of cheese he had picked up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> at the store before leaving Prairie</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> City. Both nights he slept on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ground, his saddle for a pillow, scanty</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> saddle blanket his only covering. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> seemed to grow more lean and leath-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ery by the hour, but in those puck-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ered old eyes a gleam of triumph was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> growing sharper and sharper. And at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> mid-morning of the third day, gaunt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and dusty, Sheriff Barney Carr</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> jogged back toward Prairie City.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On his way in he dropped by at</seg><seg type="columnLine">v the Circle C S for another little talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Buck Caspian and Milo Stud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inger. But the only person about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranch was a wrinkled old Mexican,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom Caspian and Studinger had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hired as a man of all work about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. The Mexican was squatted on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heels in front of the ranchhouse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his black eyes, as he looked up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">face the sheriff, were sullen and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Howdy, Pedro," hailed Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carr cheerfully. "Where's Buck and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Milo? Up at the new well?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">PEDRO SPAT deliberately, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">contempt which made Barney's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes narrow. "They are in jail," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pedro. "You should know that, Senor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carr. You--who have posed as their</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend. Yes--they are in your jail."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney Carr was suddenly very</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool and quiet. "Let me get that right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pedro. You say Buck and Milo are</seg><seg type="columnLine">in jail. Who arrested them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your deputy, of course. Who</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have taken them, if not you?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ed Dow arrested them, he and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">posse. That, Senor--was black</seg><seg type="columnLine">treachery on your part. And I,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pedro Lopez have little liking of you</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A flash of grim anger showed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney Carr's eyes, then faded to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool, calculating gleam. "If I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsible for it, I wouldn't blame</seg><seg type="columnLine">you for feeling that way, Pedro," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "But I haven't been anywhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">near town for the past two days and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nights and I knew nothing of this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nor did I give the order that it should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be done."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pedro searched the sheriff's face</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a long, intent scrutiny, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded. "I am sorry, Senor," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravely. "You are not at fault. But 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">would get to town quickly, for among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the posse I heard some talk of lynch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Grab a bronc, Pedro," said Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney Carr grimly. "We'll ride in to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They wasted no time along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail, but Barney Carr slowed as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the outskirts of the Prairie</seg><seg type="columnLine">City. The town was crowded, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">single street full of milling riders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And there was a group of miners</seg><seg type="columnLine">there also. Barney let out a gusty</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath of relief. There was a lynch</seg><seg type="columnLine">mob forming, all right. But it hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the point of insensate, blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">80</seg><seg type="columnLine">2-GUN WESTERN</seg><seg type="columnLine">action yet. Which meant that Buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caspian and Milo Studinger were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still safe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Stick around, Pedro," said Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney. "Nothing to worry about yet. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">got a little chore over at Doc Oliver's</seg><seg type="columnLine">place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney slipped around the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to Doc Oliver's house, which also</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained the doctor's office and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospital bed or two. Doc Oliver him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self let Barney in at the back door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"About time you were showing up,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">grumbled Doc. "There'll be a lynch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing bee if you don't do something</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty quick.

"Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">him good. Teach him something. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">about that drummer, Doc? Is he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking a*.y clearer, now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "He's about well enough to travel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if that's what you mean. You want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see him, of course?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yeah. For a few minutes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The drummer was sitting up in bed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">head encased in a broad, white band-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age. "I know what you want," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">peevishly, as soon as Barney entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room. "And there is only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing I can add to what I told you</seg><seg type="columnLine">before.

It ain't much--but it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">all I can do about it, sheriff."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gleam in Barney Carr's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">had deepened. "You got no idea how</seg><seg type="columnLine">much that little thing means, amigo.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thanks--a heap."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that moment a wild, deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">throated, concerted yell echoed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the street. The drummer</seg><seg type="columnLine">squirmed nervously. "Now what?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded shrilly. "The crazy, damned</seg><seg type="columnLine">country... !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney was already on his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">•	out. "Just a few of the boys who</seg><seg type="columnLine">need to have their ideas straightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">out," he drawled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MOB had made up it's mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The crowd, a full hundred strong,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was massed before the door of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff's office, swaying, growling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursing--yelling for the prisoners.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ed Dow stood on the step, facing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that mob. He had a sawed off shot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun, held waist high, the twin muz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zles swinging back and forth in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatening arc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sheriff Barney Carr, slipping un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed up to the fringe of the mob,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched Ed Dow and nodded grimly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Worried," he told himself--"worried</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a little uncertain, the kid is. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">not one damned bit afraid. He'll do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then Barney Carr went driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the mob and he was no long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er a shuffling, amiable, easy going old</seg><seg type="columnLine">timer. In some strange and mysteri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous way he seemed to have grown tall-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er. His leathery face was grim and</seg><seg type="columnLine">harsh, his puckered eyes full of fluid</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice. Men who turned to curse him</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he shouldered them aside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quieted suddenly as they glimpsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ice in the old man's eyes. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a burly miner, somewhat addled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with drink, aimed an angry blow at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney Carr, Barney gun-whipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with the merciless speed of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pouncing wolf. And in two more</seg><seg type="columnLine">strides, Barney was up on the steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside Ed Dow and turning to face</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mob.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They yelled when they saw who it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, yelled taunts and threats. Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney looked them over coolly, waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they quieted. "You're clawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the wrong corral if you think</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're going to take any prisoners</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the kid and me," he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">them harshly. "You might as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">break it up and git. Lynching is out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's final!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ed Dow didn't say a word, but Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney heard his deep gulp of relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The mob wanted to argue. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">want Caspian and Studinger," yelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them. "We're going to string</seg><seg type="columnLine">those two damned crooks up. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have been hung long ago. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't keep us away from them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Barney Car was a snarl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing old tiger. He half crouched and</seg><seg type="columnLine">both big guns leaped into his hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's what you think!" he spat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BLOOD AND SWEAT - OR BULLETS?</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come and get 'em, if you think</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're good enough. Ed, when I say</seg><seg type="columnLine">the word, let 'em have that buckshot</seg><seg type="columnLine">--both barrels. We'll show 'em who</seg><seg type="columnLine">runs the law in these parts!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That put it all distinctly up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mob and they didn't like the spot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They might have rushed Ed Dow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he been alone. They might even</seg><seg type="columnLine">have rushed Barney Carr, had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">been alone. But the prospect of rush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing both these defenders of the law,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when one held a sawed off shotgun</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the other a pair of ready and</seg><seg type="columnLine">potent six guns--well, that was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those in the front rank of the mob</seg><seg type="columnLine">began pushing back, away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">threat of the guns&gt; Those in back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasonably safe if the guns should</seg><seg type="columnLine">bark, tried to hold the lines. Soon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mob was quarreling and cursing</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and forth among its members.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney Carr knew the signs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They don't want any of it, kid,''</seg><seg type="columnLine">he told Ed Dow quietly. "They'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">heading for the bars to try and drink</seg><seg type="columnLine">their self-respect back pretty quick."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney holstered his guns, lifted an</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm for attention. "I see Chet Chad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row and Sten Vinson out there," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted. "They claim to be the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt by that hold-up. I'll talk com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise with 'em--but I won't be bull-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ied into anything. All right, Shadrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to talk it over, we'll try and hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">some agreement."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen, chief," muttered Ed Dow</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a choked sort of voice, "I ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure but what I've made a damned</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool of myself. But Caspian and Stud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inger get a fair break before the law.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't stand for them to be turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to Shadrow and Vinson on any</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of a compromise. That goes!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Good kid!" murmured Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carr. You're learning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mob, knowing its bluff had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been called, and anxious to save its</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, hailed Barney Carr's proposi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion with a yell of approval. Shadrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Vinson were shoved forward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they came up to the steps sullenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm tired, boys," said Barney Carr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"My feet hurt. Let's go in and sit</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, where we can talk this over</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet."</seg><seg type="columnLine">LIE LED the way in and relaxed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a sigh behind his battered</seg><seg type="columnLine">old desk. At the rear of the office</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a locked door. This led directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the jail in back. Ed Dow moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and stood with his back to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. He was taking no chances on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shadrow and Vinson pulling some</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise move and winning a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">past that door to the two prisoners</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond. Barney Carr smiled slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself as he noted the move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shadrow straddled a chair, stocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sullenly defiant. Vinson, a thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced man of medium size, nervous as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cat with all the excitement, paced</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and down the room a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">times before he sat down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm surprised at you two," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney Carr, in his old, amiable man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner. "Last men in the world I'd ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect to see in a mob. That ain't law</seg><seg type="columnLine">and order and you know it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It ain't law and order to let hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ups and killers run loose in this coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try, either," growled Chet Shadrow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"When the man supposed to handle</seg><seg type="columnLine">such things, which is you, Carr, won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">get off the dime--why then you got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to expect the boys to take things</seg><seg type="columnLine">into their own hands. If Ed Dow</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't listened to reason and gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and slapped an arrest on Caspian</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Studinger, them two whelps</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been clear out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">county by this time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Buck and Milo wouldn't have left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the county," drawled Barney Carr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No need of 'em to. They ain't done</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything wrong. Ed made a mistake</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he went out and arrested them</seg><seg type="columnLine">two. But Ed's young and anxious to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do his duty. Any kid is liable to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">over-eager and make a mistake. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">I ain't blaming Ed none. I'm blam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing," and here a distinct edge came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the old sheriff's voice-- "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">blaming them who talked Ed into it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Which, I'll gamble, is you, Shadrow--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you, Vinson. I figured you'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably overplay your hand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shadrow grew very still in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. Vinson stirred, licking his lips.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What you driving at?" blurted Shad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row. "I don't like what you're hinting</seg><seg type="columnLine">at."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shouldn't imagine you would,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shadrow. You're both under arrest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course. I'm charging you with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder of Jim Dykes and Shove</seg><seg type="columnLine">Macklin, and for robbing the stage</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were driving and guarding." Ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">82</seg><seg type="columnLine">2-GUN WESTERN</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruptly Barney Carr was a watchful</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiger again arfd his puckered eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of ice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shadrow's laugh was more like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled cough than anything else.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're loco," he scoffed. "Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">make me laugh. Charging me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding up my own stage."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," said Vinson thinly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're senile, Carr. I'd be liable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">steal the payroll of my own mine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not your mine, Vinson," rapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney curtly. "You only work there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now let's get down to cases. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">weren't in town the day of the rob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bery, were you, Shadrow. You passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the story that you were at Stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corral. Well, you went out there all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right--in a buckboard. But you didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay there. You got a saddle bronc</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Stone Corral and told the folks</seg><seg type="columnLine">there you were riding into Baker</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valley to look over the road and see</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it needed fixing for stage</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel. Well, you rode into Baker</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valley all right, but then you cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">back down White Horse Creek where</seg><seg type="columnLine">you met Vinson. I found out at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine that Vinson was away during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time of the hold-up. Shut up!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm talking--and don't try and make</seg><seg type="columnLine">any breaks. Keep an eye on 'em, Ed."</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARNEY CARR stuffed tobacco</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his old pipe, puffed out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge cloud of smoke. His cold eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabbed back and forth at Vinson</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Shadrow as he tolled out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">indictment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you pulled that holdup. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a chance Jim Dykes or Shove</seg><seg type="columnLine">Macklin might have recognized you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So you shot 'em down--cold. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought you'd left that traveling man</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead, too. Then you grabbed the pay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll money and headed back into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tut Bank country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There you split up. Vinson went</seg><seg type="columnLine">out over the Hardin Valley trail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which leads right around in back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rawhide Peak, where the mines are,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which made it easy for him to slide</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the mine, soft and cute. Shad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row, you took, to White Horse Creek</seg><seg type="columnLine">and headed back for Baker Valley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You thought riding the creek bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">would cover up your tracks.

And then wasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">no time steering talk toward Buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caspian and Milo Studinger. Easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to blame it on them two boys, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their past records. You and Vinson</seg><seg type="columnLine">had that angle all figured, didn't you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, it might have fooled a kid like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ed Dow, who is just learning this</seg><seg type="columnLine">law game.

If Shane had looked at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, the sheriff would have read the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear in Webb"s face. But Shane's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were probing about the ranch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard. Webb Freeman's spread had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen better days, for blackleg had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken a lot of his cattle the season</seg><seg type="columnLine">before but Webb knew Shane wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for the signs of his poverty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bert around?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My boy? Nope. Sent him to comb</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few strays out o' the timber," Webb</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied. "We're kinda short of ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">cash hereabouts so I thought I'd have</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bert drive some stock to the butcher</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Mustang."</seg><seg type="columnLine">ANVIL SHANE digested the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation thoughtfully, tugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his moustache. And Webb, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew Shane better than he knew any</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, recognized that tell-tale symp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom. There was something the sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to say but didn't know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">to word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yuh wanted tuh see Bert?" Webb</seg><seg type="columnLine">encouraged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No-o-o," Shane countered. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">might keep Bert close to the place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though." He paused, reddened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurted on: "The whole country's</seg><seg type="columnLine">just about loco account of this Jump-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Jack. Folks don't always think</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight when they're riled up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they're apt to be suspicious of a shad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ow. Bert does a lot of lopin' around</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his lonesome..</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The words stiffened Webb. Anvil</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shane was voicing Webb's own sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picions but it hurt like blazes to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone else point an accusing</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger at Bert Freeman. Something</seg><seg type="columnLine">akin to wrath tinged Webb's tone</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yuh mean folks think my boy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Jumpin' Jack?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now don't get het up," Shane said</seg><seg type="columnLine">soothingly. "Half the country is sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picious of the other half. Look at it</seg><seg type="columnLine">this way, Webb. You're broke, need</seg><seg type="columnLine">money. You been a damn good dad to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bert and the younker would probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">do anything to help you out. Bert's</seg><seg type="columnLine">about twenty, ain't he? Just at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild age when a younker's mady to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do a man's work but ain't got a man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">judgment. You see how it adds up?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And that's what yuh believe?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Webb asked weakly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anvil Shane rested a friendly hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the oldster's shoulder. "Bert's</seg><seg type="columnLine">your son--which means he couldn't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything but straight," the sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">said softly. "I'm just showin' you</seg><seg type="columnLine">how a lot of folks might figger</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. I'm just suggestin' you keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bert home so nobody can talk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The kindness in his voice warmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Webb Freeman. That speech was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Anvil Shane, typical of his gener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous heart. Webb had voted for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">old friend election after election and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could understand why the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mustang had unanimously fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed suit. Shane was worth it. Webb</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised grateful eyes, was framing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">reply when one of the posse called</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheriff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Come on," the fellow shouted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't chin all night, Shane. We got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be riding."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Webb recognized that petulant</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice just as he recognized its fancy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garbed wasp-waisted owner. Tate</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jervis was branch manager of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Western Overland Stage Company</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Mustang and Webb understood</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man's eagerness to be on the trail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The mysterious black-masked bandit</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been dubbed the Jumping Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he had flitted from holdup</seg><seg type="columnLine">to holdup. But mostly the Jumping</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack had concentrated on the gold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laden stages of the Western Over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land. The head office at Helena had</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered five thousand dollars reward</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his capture. Rumor had it they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were riding Tate Jervis pretty hard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">prodding him for action on the mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Webb watched Anvil Shane join</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jervis and the others, gallop on up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trail. Then Webb sat alone on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steps and the shadows gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">86</seg><seg type="columnLine">2-GUN WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blurring out the surroundings were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">no blacker than his thoughts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Anvil Shane had denied that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">suspicions against Bert were his own</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but the sheriff hadn't fooled Webb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Shane was giving Bert Freeman the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">benefit of doubt because Anvil Shane</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and Webb had began ^a friendship in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Texas thirty years before. That</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">friendship had matured here in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Montana where both men had mi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grated. Shane and old Webb had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mighty close but there was one phase</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of Webb's life that Anvil Shane</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">didn't know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ANVIL SHANE didn't know about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the early years of Webb's mar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ried life. Shane had been pushing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cattle north in those days. True,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">'' Shane had probably heard of Wild</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Bill Leatherby, the Texas badman,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">who had been corraled and sent to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">prison for twenty years. But Shane</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">didn't know Webb and his wife had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">adopted the infant son of Wild Bill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Leatherby to bless their childless</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">marriage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was Webb's secret, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Webb's alone. His wife had died a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dozen years before and Wild Bill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Leatherby was lost among the shad-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ows of the past. So Webb had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">living with fear and uncertainty</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">since the Jumping Jack had began to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ride. Webb had reared Bert by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">same rigid code of honesty that had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">governed Webb's own life. But blood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is blood--and Bert Freeman was the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">son of Wild Bill Leatherby, bad-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The dead past had refused to stay</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">buried, Webb reflected bitterly. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">called Bert his son and the boy was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">everything to him that the word im-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plied. He thought of it now and felt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">very old and very much alone. Then,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as though summoned genii-like by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his thoughts, Bert Freeman dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mounted at the corral, headed for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Bert might have been his kin for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the boy was tall and lath-like too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">His shock of hair was the same blue-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">black that Webb's had been before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the years had thinned it and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sprinkled it with gray. Slumping</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down beside his foster father, the boy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grinned wanly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Left the beef in the corral up at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the line shack," he reported. "I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive 'em down to Mustang come</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Webb remembered Anvil Shane's</seg><seg type="columnLine">advice about keeping Bert at home</seg><seg type="columnLine">but only grunted. After all, Bert was</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty, a man by range standards.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bert had taken a lot of the work</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Webb's shoulders. He couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">order the boy to hang around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranch-yard from now on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His hands were tied by Bert's ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turity and next morning he watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently as Bert rode away. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beginning of a week of sheer tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture for the lanky oldster for each</seg><seg type="columnLine">day the boy found something to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in the saddle and Webb was</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually in bed when Bert returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">by night. They always met at break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast and, facing the boy across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, Webb' would choke back</seg><seg type="columnLine">thronging questions he wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask and couldn't.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once Webb saddled up, rode down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Mustang. There were supplies to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be bought but, afterwards, Webb</seg><seg type="columnLine">prodded himself into the sheriff's</seg><seg type="columnLine">office. Anvil Shane greeted him</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearily and gave him the information</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wanted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yep, the Jumping Jack held up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospector night afore last," Shane</seg><seg type="columnLine">reported.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were new worry lines etched</seg><seg type="columnLine">in S'.iane's broad face and a heap of</seg><seg type="columnLine">untouched correspondence was piled</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon his desk. Webb didn't linger</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he almost collided with Tate</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jervis as he went through the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The carefully-dressed Western Over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land manager gave Webb a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching glance as the oldster</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunted his apology.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Afterwards Webb toiled up the hill</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail to the ranch and found Bert ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent. Nor did the boy show up for</seg><seg type="columnLine">supper. Webb spent another solitary</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening brooding on the porch steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went to bed early. But his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts made for sleeplessness. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered where Bert was riding--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and why. And he was still wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Bert came in hours later. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the boy steal along the hall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause for a moment at Webb's bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room door. Then, apparently deciding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oldster was asleep, Bert went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR LONG moments Webb lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">there listening. Then, impelled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">KILLER'S HERITAGE</seg><seg type="columnLine">87</seg><seg type="columnLine">some undefinable urge, he rose, picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his boots and tiptoed to the porch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pulling on the boots, he started for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barn, a phantom-like figure in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">flapping white nightgown. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze chilled him and he was glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach the shelter of the barn where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fumbled for a lantern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bert's horse, a deep-chested roan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in its stall and saddle and gear</seg><seg type="columnLine">were tossed over the stall partition.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Webb peered about uncertainly, over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelmed by the fact that he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what he sought. The roan had</seg><seg type="columnLine">its nose in a ration of oats and, with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out forethought, Webb plunged his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand into the oat bin. His probing</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers closed on something buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">there and he drew the object into</seg><seg type="columnLine">view. Moving the lantern closer, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">examined his find and his eyes wid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened with horror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many men had seen the Jumping</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack and all of the victims had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported like descriptions--a tall man</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed in nondescript range garb</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wearing a black mask. Sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the details of the garb varied but al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways that black mask had been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">insignia of the Jumping Jack. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Webb was clutching such a mask in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his trembling fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thrust the mask back into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oat bin, blew out the lantern and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeled toward the house. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night breeze sighing down from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peaks seemed to carry the mocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter of Wild Bill Leatherby to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. It was like the death knell of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifetime's hopes. He had tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mould Bert Freeman after himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">but wild blood had had its way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Webb carried that hideous thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bed with him and it kept him toss-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and turning until sunup. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he awoke from fitful slumber, Bert</seg><seg type="columnLine">had left. But Webb was glad he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't have to face his foster son</seg><seg type="columnLine">this morning--and he was glad to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone to fight the battle he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">All through the long day he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrestled with his problem. What was</seg><seg type="columnLine">he to do with his knowledge? A doz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">en times he thought of facing Bert</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an accusation but discarded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">notion. Bert would naturally deny</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything. It would be far better to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to Sheriff Anvil Shane, lay the</seg><seg type="columnLine">facts before him, Webb owed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">much to his old friend. But Webb</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that to do so would be like</seg><seg type="columnLine">betraying his own flesh and blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, when the shadows were</seg><seg type="columnLine">spilling from thf peaks once again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Webb heard a clatter of hoofs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he hurried to the door Sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anvil Shane was dismounting before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had arrested Bert! All day</seg><seg type="columnLine">Webb had contemplated betraying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy to the law himself but sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the squat lawman filled him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic. Shane's first words dispelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Webb's fear, however.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm still trailin' the Jumpin' Jack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Webb," the lawman said as he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ushered to the living room. "Thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd drop in this way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Reckon yuh'll cut his sign one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these days," Webb ventured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe so," Shane reflected and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proffered rocking chair creaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his weight. "Me, I'm tryin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty hard. Had an idea to start</seg><seg type="columnLine">checkin' on everybody workin' for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Western Overland seein' is how that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hellion always seems to know when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gold shipment's cornin' through.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tate Jervis reckoned it was a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea but figgered it would take too</seg><seg type="columnLine">long. Seems like Western Overland</seg><seg type="columnLine">is hollerin' for blood--and pronto--</seg><seg type="columnLine">so Tate's got a better idea."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tate's a smart hombre."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A gold shipment's cornin' over</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Missoula tomorrow aft-ernoon,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shane went on. "Tate's having a spe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cial driver and a special shot-gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard, hand-picked men. Likewise</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tate's riding the stage hisself this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time and he's a good hand with a gun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's asked me to come along so</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'll be four of us all primed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble. If the Jumping Jack stops</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, one of us is bound to get a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make a play. The reward is to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">split four ways."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ought to be a cinch if the hom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bre shows up," Webb said and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes drilled into Shane's "Just why</seg><seg type="columnLine">yuh tellin' me all this, Anvil?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">'THE DIRECTNESS of the ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion staggered Anvil Shane. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared wordlessly, one hand tugging</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his moustache. Webb knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">once again Shane had something to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say and didn't know how to say it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Spill it," he urged the lawman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">88</seg><seg type="columnLine">2-GUN WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Wa-al, I don't exactly know</seg><seg type="columnLine">where to begin," Shane stammered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yuh see, Webb, this being a lawdog</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a tough job. A gent sorta has to</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget he's human and that's mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard sometimes. Reckon every sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">has a day when he wonders which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's gonna serve--his badge or his-</seg><seg type="columnLine">6elf. And when a gent's had hisself</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled out of the Canadian on a trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive and nursed through a seige of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smallpox, it's sorta hard to for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">get..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I saved yore carcass a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of times," Webb interjected feeling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, "it was because I had the chance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reckon yuh'd 'a' done likewise."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just the same, a lot of water's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone under the bridge for us two,</seg><seg type="columnLine">old-timer," Anvil Shane said, hushed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voiced.

Nodding cordially, he strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the room and into the kitch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">en.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Watching him go, Webb wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">how long Bert had been on the porch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how much of the talk he had heard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And wondering, he remembered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things he, Webb, might say to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff. But Webb's tongue was</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anvil Shane wasn't sure Bert was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Jumping Jack. Otherwise the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff would be doing his duty--ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting Bert. At showdown Shane</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be true to his badge but for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time being he had side-stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty to warn Webb of the death trap</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting the Jumping Jack. And with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bert out there in the kitchen, Webb</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew he was going to side-step his</seg><seg type="columnLine">obvious duty too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked to the gate with Shane</seg><seg type="columnLine">in silence and when the lawman clam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered into his saddle Webb shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand, a long, hard grasp eloquent</seg><seg type="columnLine">or his unspoken gratitude. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched Shane lope away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Returning to the house, Webb</seg><seg type="columnLine">found Bert preparing supper. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">oldster helped. Bert, facing him</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the table later, spoke for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wasn't the sheriff saying some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about a trap for the Jumping</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack just before I walked in?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked between mouthfuls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," Webb replied and avoided</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bert's eyes. "Of course it's sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidential like, but the stage will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be loaded with gunnies tomorrow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They'll get that gent for shore if he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy enough to show up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Covertly he watched for a sign as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he spoke but Bert gave none. Still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warning had been passed along.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At least Bert wouldn't tackle the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Missoula stage on the morrow. Webb</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried that consolation to bed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and was gladened next day to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that Bert lingered near the ranch</seg><seg type="columnLine">house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">TUDYING him from the porch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Webb knew the first measure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">contentment he had tasted in a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Perhaps the news of the gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trap had sobered Bert, started him</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking of the odds that are perpet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually stacked against those who ride</seg><seg type="columnLine">the owlhoot. Maybe Shane would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never learn the whole truth and Bert</seg><seg type="columnLine">might still become the kind of son</seg><seg type="columnLine">Webb had hoped he would be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those were peaceful thoughts and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lingering over them, Webb felt as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though a load had been lifted from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heart. His chin sank upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest for it was a warm, pleasant day</seg><seg type="columnLine">and under the spell of the smiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">skies and his re-born hopes he began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to doze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He awoke with a start. Shadows</seg><seg type="columnLine">were spearing downward and the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dying fast. Coming to his feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Webb entered the house, found it</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty. Half-stunned by a budding</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear, he lurched into the yard, called</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bert's name. Only his echo answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bert was gone! And with the reali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zation, Webb knew Bert had gone to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop the Missoula stage. The boy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been warned but there was one thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Webb had forgotten, a thing Anvil</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shane had put into words when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had said Bert was ready for a man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">work but didn't have a man's judg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. For Bert, with all the self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">KILLER'S HERITAGE</seg><seg type="columnLine">89</seg><seg type="columnLine">assurance of Wild Bill Leatherby,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had undoubtedly reasoned he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn the tables, having been fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned about the gun-trap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Webb thought it all out as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed gear onto his horse. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolting for the house, he stopped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">don a holster-laden belt that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't worn for a long time. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked to his gun as he clattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the trail and found it ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">for work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No definite plan shaped itself as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he galloped along. He would let cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumstances take care of themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he reached trail's end. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail's end would be far below where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lobo Canyon cut through the Mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tang country, walling in the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">that squirmed among the hills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mentally charting the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead, Webb had a sudden hunch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Less than ten miles out of Mustang</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spring bubbled beside the canyon</seg><seg type="columnLine">road. The stage always stopped there</seg><seg type="columnLine">to allow the passengers time to drink</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to stretch their travel-cramped</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs. The canyon's walls sloped</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently at this spot. The country was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bush-mottled, a perfect place for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lone bandit to lie in hiding, waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the advantage that would be his when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passengers spilled from the stage</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Accordingly, Webb nosed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mount toward the promontory look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down on the springs. Nearing it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he dismounted, stalked forward on</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot. It was well he had adopted</seg><seg type="columnLine">caution for his hunch was correct.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crouching among the bushes at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canyon's crest was the lanky form</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Bert Freeman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Webb hadn't arrived a minute too</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon. The portion of the road below</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he glimpsed was empty but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear the creak of the stage, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracking driver's' whip, and he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the death-laden coach was just around</seg><seg type="columnLine">a turn. And Bert was ready to strike.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He hadn't donned the black mask yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he was looking to his gun, testing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hammer action. Satisfied, he eased</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weapon back into leather again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at that moment Webb moved for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three long, lunging strides brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to his foster son's side. Jabbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gun into Bert's' spine, he snatched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy's weapon, thrust it into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own belt. Bert stiffened, turned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and dismay creased his face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Dad!" he gasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Webb, "it's' me, son,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I"m sorry it had to be me. I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">like tuh think that what yuh've been</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing, yuh been doing to help me out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd like to think yuh didn't mean to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut down on Shorty Dale. But what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think don't count for much. Yuh see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, I know yuh're the Jumpin' Jack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found the mask."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're. . .you're makin' a mistake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dad," Bert blurted. "You..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Nope," Webb said. "I'm not mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in' a mistake this time. I made my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistake a long spell ago but..."</seg><seg type="columnLine">HIS WORDS choked him. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been ready to say his mistake</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been in adopting the son of Wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill Leatherby. But gazing at the boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the barrel of a gun, sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">moisture stung the oldster's eyes as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew a stunning truth. Regardless</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Bert's Freeman's wild blood, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gardless of the tragic outcome to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy's career, he had raised this</seg><seg type="columnLine">youngster. For years he had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself believe Bert was really his</seg><seg type="columnLine">kin until the thought had become an</seg><seg type="columnLine">actuality. And even now at the bitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">end, Webb Freeman didn't want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">change that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But regardless of his feelings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Webb's duty lay clear before him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anvil Shane had given Bert the bene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fit of doubt because of a long-fos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered friendship and Webb had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">content to take advantage of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendship and still his own con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">science. Bert had spoiled that by com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing here, showing his hand. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing left to do but turn Bert</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to the sheriff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The stage had jerked to a bone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jolting stop below. Anvil Shane was</seg><seg type="columnLine">piling from the big Concord and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasp-waisted Tate Jervis was easing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground after him. With a nod</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his head, Webb indicated the trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading downward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Move on below, Bert," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Bert opened his mouth to speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Webb never heard him. For Webb</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself was suddenly shouting, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror-inspired shriek. By the road-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side Anvil Shane had thrown himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">prone to the ground to bury his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the bubbling spring. Tate Jervis</seg><seg type="columnLine">90</seg><seg type="columnLine">2-GUN WESTERN</seg><seg type="columnLine">was palming a gun, leveling it at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawling lawman!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gun spoke but Webb had saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">his old friend's life. His ear-splitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">shout had disconcerted Jervis just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man's finger squeezed the trigger</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Shane had lifted his head to</seg><seg type="columnLine">listen. The bullet that would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried itself in the lawman's brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">grazed his head and Shane sank for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward unconscious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Tate Jervis raised panic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken eyes, glimpsed the two on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crest of the canyon. With a hoarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellow of rage and fear, Jervis fired</seg><seg type="columnLine">at them even as he hurled words at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the driver and the shot-gun guard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gun them two!" he bellowed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They saw me shoot Shane!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Webb was charging downward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bert beside him. There was a lot the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oldster couldn't understand about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing he had witnessed but certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">facts were obvious enough. One was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Tate Jervis had tried to kill An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vil Shane. And the guard and driver</seg><seg type="columnLine">were involved too. All three were</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly bent on killing the witnesses</seg><seg type="columnLine">for bullets buzzed about the Freemans</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they dodged and twisted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Webb wasted no time wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the deal. His gun was answer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the challenge of those below and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he rememebered Bert was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed. Snatching the extra weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his belt, he passed it over word-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly and both went into action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guard with his scattergun was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deadliest menace as they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into close range and Webb broke the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in the middle with a snap shot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Jervis had truly hand-picked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">driver and Jervis himself was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">slouch with a six. Both were spray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing lead that was finding marks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Webb cursed as his thigh flamed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">agony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Bert was shooting now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Webb's eyes snapped wide as he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deadly efficiency of his foster</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. Bert's gun bucked once, a care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less shot apparently, and the driver</seg><seg type="columnLine">reared upward, sprawled head fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most to the road. It was miraculous</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bhooting and suddenly Webb under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood its meaning. This was Bert's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heritage! Whatever else the boy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">or hadn't gotten from Wild Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leatherby, his was the same deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand as his owlhoot sire's.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN BERT crumpled. While he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been gunning the driver Tate</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jervis had utilized the moment to aim</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the boy. The bullet had struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bert in the leg. With a fierce yell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage, Webb brought up his own gun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eared back the hammer and Tate</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jervis was slammed against the stage</seg><seg type="columnLine">to slip lifeless to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bloody and disheveled, Webb Free-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man stood panting. His oldest friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">still lay silently beside the spring but</seg><seg type="columnLine">though his heart went out to Anvil</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shane, it was Bert that he turned to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wincing with pain, Webb kneeled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered the boy in his arms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">something clogged the oldster's</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat when he spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't savvy this set-up a-tall."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Webb said. "But I do savvy yore gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved my bacon today, son..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A bullet had furrowed Bert's scalp</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the boy grinned through a bloody</seg><seg type="columnLine">mask. "There's things I was gonna</seg><seg type="columnLine">say before the fireworks started,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dad," he said. "Maybe they'll help</seg><seg type="columnLine">you savvy. You see, I've been trailin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Jumpin' Jack for weeks. I fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered that five thousand reward</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come in mighty handy out our</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. When you told me about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun-trap set for today, I figgered it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was my last chance. Either 1 got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandit before he stepped into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trap--or not at all. So I rode out here</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lay for him. .."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But Jeivis tried tuh shoot Anvil,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Webb muttered in bewilderment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the light of truth dawned upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.. "I savvy," he ejaculated. "Jervis</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the Jumping Jack! Shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough! When Anvil figgered on</seg><seg type="columnLine">checkin' on the gents workin' for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Western Overland, Tate got woriied</seg><seg type="columnLine">seein' as Anvil was gettin' close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the truth. So Tate talked Anvil intuh</seg><seg type="columnLine">takin' this ride along with him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">these other two jaspers who must 'a'</seg><seg type="columnLine">been helpin' Tate all along. Tate</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably figgered on gettin' rid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anvil and grabbing this gold ship-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment at the same time. Afterwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'd 'a' reported that the Jumpin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack had did the job!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It all fits," Bert ruminated slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I found a black mask near the West-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern Overland office but I didn't savvy</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the time." His grin broadened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And you found the mask out in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barn.

The place looked desperately</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor, but neat. At the back of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire length; its southern outlet was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thin cleft in the hills that was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gateway into Mexico. In spots, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">really a canyon. One of these spots</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just beyond the cabin, where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">granite walls drew in till they almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That won't do," Russ Kilrain was</seg><seg type="columnLine">RUSS KILRAIN cursed sudden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, with angry surprise, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">upraised hand halted the five</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardfaced riders behind him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What the hell!"

A tight, sardonic smile twisted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips as he rode. Despite the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his home range was only twenty miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, in the northern end of the ba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sin, the odds were against his know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing whoever was in that dilapidated</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin. He'd been away almost five</seg><seg type="columnLine">years.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The transformation</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrought by those five years, Kent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Varing realized, was bad. The basin</seg><seg type="columnLine">had known him as a wild, but honest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">good-natured buckaroo. Folks had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned and predicted that slim, red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired Barbara Wayne would tame</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. But, a week before her scheduled</seg><seg type="columnLine">marriage to Kent Varing, Barbara</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wayne had suddenly and without ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planation married handsome Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ivor, and the devils that were in Kent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Varing's heart burst their bonds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He'd sworn to kill Ivor. But dud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish, whiskey-drinking Jack Ivor, son</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a well-to-do cowman, had turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow and refused to fight. So Kent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Varing had ridden away, swearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">never to return. The last year he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">been riding with Russ Kilrain's gang</seg><seg type="columnLine">over in New Mexico.

Drawn by the racket, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide-eyed, curly-haired boy of no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than four, came onto the porch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stared solemnly at Kent Varing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Varing dismounted, his silver spurs</seg><seg type="columnLine">jingling as he placed one shiny boot</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the porch. He asked, "You here all</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, sonny?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You ain't my daddy," lisped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">youngster, backing away. He called,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mummy! Mummy!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Footsteps sounded inside, and a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice asked, "What is it, Billy? Ia</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody...?" The voice dwindled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kent Varing had thought he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">imune to shock. But something almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a physical blow shook him as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze lifted to the woman in the door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. This was not the figure of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams that he'd seen in the red heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a hundred campfires, but living</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh and blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barbara whispered, "Kent--Kent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Varing! Why--why..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The years had changed Barbara too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still slim and pretty, but there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">haunting sadness about her violet</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. She looked thin, tired, and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands were toil-worn. She stood there</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at Varing, bewilderment in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Varing fought to steady his whirl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing mind. Barbara--here! He was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious of resentment for the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was still able to make him feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">fierce emotions. Affecting a casual-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness he didn't feel, Kent Varing</seg><seg type="columnLine">doffed his cream sombrero, smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">tautly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said, "I'm sorry, Barbara. I--</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know you were here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The youngster was tugging at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother's skirts. "That ain't my dad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dy," he piped. "Who is it, Mummy?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barbara said, "Hush, Billy." Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Kent Varing, "I--won't you come</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, Kent? You look tired, and hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gry"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On an impulse, Kent Varing went</seg><seg type="columnLine">HARDCASE OR COWARD?</seg><seg type="columnLine">93</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the cabin. The room was neat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean, but almost bare of furnishings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It showed evidence of desperate pov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Varing asked abruptly, "Barbara,</seg><seg type="columnLine">why are you here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her face pale and still, she said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I live here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And Jack Ivor...?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He lives here too. This is our son,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy. He was born soon after you--</seg><seg type="columnLine">went away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Jack Ivor brought you here--to</seg><seg type="columnLine">live?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">WISTFUL smile touched her red</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips. "Why not? There was no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where else to go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Questions hammered at Kent Var-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing's mind, and memories flooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">through him. When Barbara Wayne</seg><seg type="columnLine">had married Jack Ivor, without warn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing or explanation, it had cut deeply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had shattered his faith in humani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty. Barbara's head had been turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Jack Ivor's fancy clothes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashy good looks, and by the pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect of spending some of old Buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ivor's cattle money, Varing had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Five years ago, Buck Ivor had</seg><seg type="columnLine">owned a big cow outfit. Jack Ivor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had money to squander on whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">key and cards and women. Why, then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Barbara here in this squalid</seg><seg type="columnLine">shack?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There was nowhere else to go,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barbara said simply, uncomplaining-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. "Soon after we were married.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack's father died. He left us the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranch. But things didn't go well. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost cattle. Drought came. Things</seg><seg type="columnLine">went from bad to worse, and we lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ranch, everything. That was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">year and a half ago."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a brave tilt to Barbara's</seg><seg type="columnLine">chin as she talked. Kent Varing sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vied what had happened, as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">from what she left unsaid as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things she said. She was still loyal to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack Ivor. She didn't say that Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ivor had gambled their ranch away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spent it on whiskey and dance</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall flossies, but Kent Varing knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was what had happened. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't admit that she'd married a</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakling and a coward, but Varing</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that that knowledge too was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So we came here," she went on as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if talking helped her. "We just moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. Nobody would live here; the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">was supposed to be haunted, or some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. Everybody who'd ever tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">live here had been killed, or scared</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. But we didn't have any choice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We've lived here a year and a half</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nothing's happened. There's not</seg><seg type="columnLine">much room, but the ground's fertile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We have a garden, and raise a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">cattle. ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kent Varing listened as she talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. She was trying pitifully to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vince him that she was happy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied here. Varing knew she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither. He looked at a row of empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiskey bottles on the mantel, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the answer. Jack Ivor was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">a weakling, a wastrel, and with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the depths he was dragging his</seg><seg type="columnLine">loyal wife and their curly-haired son.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Varing knew why they hadn't been</seg><seg type="columnLine">molested here. Russ Kilrain had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. But now he was back. A chill</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched Kent Varing; momentarily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had forgotten why he was here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kilrain's wolves had killed others</seg><seg type="columnLine">who'd tried to live here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kent Varing thought: Why should</seg><seg type="columnLine">I warn them away? These two, Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ivor and Barbara Wayne, had humili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated him, hurt him more than any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body else in the world. They'd sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly turned a world of brightness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hope into a place of darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bitterness. Let Russ Kilrain move</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in his own way. .. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy had lost his shyness. Fie</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed hesitantly onto Kent Varing's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lap and tugged with pudgy hands at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ivory handle of one of his six-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooters. "Are you a sher'ff?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Varing grinned, said, "Not exact-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, Button!" He looked at Barbara,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knew that she guessed the truth</seg><seg type="columnLine">--that he was an outlaw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jack should be in soon," Barbara</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "He went to town this evening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I--he'll be glad to see you. Kent, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you alone?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No." After all, he thought, why</seg><seg type="columnLine">should a girl and a curly-haired kid</seg><seg type="columnLine">be made to suffer for Jack Ivor's sins?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He said, "Barbara, you've got to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Leave here?" She shook her head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We couldn't do that. We have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">94</seg><seg type="columnLine">2-GUN WESTERN</seg><seg type="columnLine">where else to go. Why should we</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "People have died here in this cab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But that was several years ago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nobody has bothered us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They might, if you stay. You must</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave, as soon as you can."</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARBARA shook her head again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I know you have a reason for</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying those things, Kent. But we've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to stay here--got to! It's our</seg><seg type="columnLine">only chance, Jack's only chance. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know I haven't fooled you. You know</seg><seg type="columnLine">why we lost everything, why we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">living here. Jack's weak. He's always</seg><seg type="columnLine">had too much. I made him come here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought, away from everybody, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might--do better. In time, he may. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">his only chance, our only chance. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">married him, and I'll stick with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I owe him that much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Varing fought back the words of</seg><seg type="columnLine">contempt he felt for Jack Ivor that</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to his lips. He said, "If you feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">that way. .."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Barbara had quieted. Her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady, she said, "I owe you some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, Kent Varing. I know how ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribly I hurt you. I want you to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">why I married Jack Ivor, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">even telling you I aimed to do it. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">can do no harm, now. I did it for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">old, old reason. Money--money Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ivor promised to pay off a mortgage</seg><seg type="columnLine">on daddy's ranch with. Jack wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">let me explain, or even tell you what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I meant to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So I married him; but I didn't get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the money. Daddy lost the ranch, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it broke his heart. He died soon after.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Buck Ivor died, and Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to go to pieces."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Fresh hate and contempt for Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ivor welled inside Kent Varing. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to his feet. He didn't want to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tack Ivor, for fear of what he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Barbara had got to her feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone to the window. She said: "Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes Jack now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Varing heard hoofbeats outside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They stopped at the rear of the cab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. and footsteps sounded as some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body entered through a back doorway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The footsteps came through a back</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, then Jack Ivor stood in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again shock over-rode the hate that</seg><seg type="columnLine">smouldered inside Varing. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't the old, debonair Jack Ivor</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd known, the old swaggering, arro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gant dandy. A stubble of beard cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered Ivor's gaunt face. His eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleary. His clothes were dirty, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kempt. Jack Ivor had a quart bottle</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand, and he swayed a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he squinted in the sudden change</seg><seg type="columnLine">from sunlight to shadow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jack Ivor asked, "Barbara, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">bronc is that outside? And who're</seg><seg type="columnLine">them hombres coyotin' out behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thicket?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Barbara said softly, "Jack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">here's an old friend of yours. Kent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Varing. .."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jack Ivor stiffened, took a back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward step. Then his eyes focused on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Varing, and he laughed sneeringly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No need to come sneakin' back now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Varing. She's my wife now, remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barbara flushed, said pleadingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Jack, please! Kent didn't know we</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived here when he stopped."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then why is he here?" Ivor asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Anyway, he knows it now. He's not</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted here. Is that plain. Varing?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kent Varing held himself rigidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in check. "Plain enough. Your skunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">smell is worse than ever, Ivor. It must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be hell to have to stand it for five</seg><seg type="columnLine">years. Five seconds is too long for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">KENT VARING whirled, strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the cabin. He swung into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle, his brown, hawkish features</seg><seg type="columnLine">harsh with anger, and sent the dun at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gallop up the incline and through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cedars to where Russ Kilrain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It took you a hell of a long time."</seg><seg type="columnLine">the burly, red-bearded Kilrain</seg><seg type="columnLine">growled impatiently. "Who's down</seg><seg type="columnLine">there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just a woman and a kid."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I saw a man ride up on a hoss a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute ago. What about him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Varing shrugged, said. "He don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">count. Soused to the gills, and yella.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Name of Jack Ivor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ivor, huh?" Kilrain grunted. "I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">had dealin's with him. He's yella, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, and treacherous. He cain't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">trusted. Rather have most anybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">there than him. Did you tell 'em to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get out?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">HARDCASE OR COWARD?</seg><seg type="columnLine">95</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," Varing said tautly. "I fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ured--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're not supposed to do any fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">urin'," Kilrain snapped, hard-eyed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're supposed to do as you're told.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm not so blasted finicky. You gents</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait here a minute!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Russ Kilrain whirled his big black,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent it pounding down the decline.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kent Varing, watching, saw him fling</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the saddle and stride into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin. He was in the cabin no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than sixty seconds. Then he came out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted and rode back to his waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. A grin was on Kilrain's thin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruel lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I gave 'em till midnight to pack</seg><seg type="columnLine">and get out," he said. "Told 'em I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">be back then. Well, l^te ride!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kilrain's four henchmen grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">wolfishly. They were hard men, scum</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the outlaw trails; murder was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of work they enjoyed. Kent Var-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing said nothing as they rode on</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the notch beyond the cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and along the widening valley. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to hide from Kilrain and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others the turmoil that was in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun was sinking into its nest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blue hills when they arrived at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hideout--a big log cabin huddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">back under the walls of a niddon can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yon. Until his depredations had be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come too bold a couple of years ago,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kilrain had operated from this head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters, driving stolen cattle south-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward into Mexico. Their trail to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Border lay along the canyon-like val-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley they'd traversed that evening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The horses were watered at a lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle stream that trickled along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canyon, and turned loose in a rude</seg><seg type="columnLine">pole corral. Kent Varing remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloof from the others as they pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared a meager meal and wolfed it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He'd never liked them; only his bit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terness had driven him to seek their</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckless company.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ivor's yella, all right," Kilrain had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "But the gal's got spunk. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same as told me to go to blazes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She said they wouldn't leave, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I	couldn't make 'em. Well, mebbe I</seg><seg type="columnLine">cain't. But I shore as hell can plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You can't kill a woman and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">kid," Varing said softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cain't I?" Russ Kilrain growled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If they're not outa that shack by</seg><seg type="columnLine">midnight, I'll burn it over their</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Varing shrugged, let the subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop. Kilrain would carry out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">threat, he knew. Kent Varing thought:</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, why not? He'd come back for</seg><seg type="columnLine">vengeance against Jack Ivor. But now</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no savor to the thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack Ivor's cattle were gone, and Ivor</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself was a broken, whiskey-soaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">derelict, without courage or hope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vengeance against Jack Ivor would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be tasteless now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER EATING, Kent Varing</seg><seg type="columnLine">went outside. A white moon had</seg><seg type="columnLine">soared into the sky. The hills were</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool and quiet and peaceful. But there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no peace in Kent Varing's mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He kept seeing the shadows in Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bara's tired eyes; he kept feeling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tug of a curly-haired youngster's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pudgy hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barbara wouldn't leave. She'd said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">''We've got to stay here. It's our only</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance, his only chance..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barbara and the youngster would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">better off with Jack Ivor dead. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">if Ivor died, they'd die too. ..</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Kent Varing roped his dun from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corral and saddled him. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back to the cabin. It still lacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">three hours till midnight. Kilrain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his four followers were seated about</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rude table, dealing blackjack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kent Varing stood just inside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway. He said, "Kilrain, you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to pull that job tonight without</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I'm takin' a little ride. Mebby</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll be back, mebby not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Surprise leaped into the eyes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kilrain and the others. Then Russ</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kilrain's reddish eyes went bleak and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wary. "You pettin' cold feet, Var-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Varing said softly. "Call it what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you like. I just don't cotton to mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derin' women and kids."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So that's it?" Kilrain purred. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't have any ideas about double-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossin' us, would you, Varing?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Varing shrugged, said, "My ideas</seg><seg type="columnLine">are my own business. I'm ridin' now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I'll have a gun lined on this door</seg><seg type="columnLine">till I'm out of sight. Adios!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He backed through the doorway</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to his horse. His eyes never left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lighted doorway as he swung into</seg><seg type="columnLine">96</seg><seg type="columnLine">2-GUN WESTERN</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saddle and spurred through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jackpines that hemmed the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He put the dun into a mile-eating</seg><seg type="columnLine">lope and headed southward. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was doing a crazy thing. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to get Barbara and the boy out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that cabin. Jack Ivor had dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">them down to disgrace and shame.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ntow, unless they left that cabin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'd die.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kent Varing knew that Kilrain</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be furious at his desertion, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicious. Maybe he wouldn't wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">till midnight to start on his murder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous mission.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moon was high in the sky when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Varing pushed his tired dun through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canyon mouth and stopped before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack Ivor's cabin. The cabin was dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">and quiet. Hope lifted inside Kent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Varing. Maybe, after all, Kilrain's</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning had had its effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, suddenly, a puppy started</seg><seg type="columnLine">barking excitedly inside the cabin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy would never have gone off with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the pup. Kent Varing dismounted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped across the porch and rapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the door with his knuckles. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment there was deathly silence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even the pup had stopped barking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Barbara's voice, calm but de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiant, called out, "Get away from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, or I'll rhoot!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Varing said, "Barbara, it's me--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kent Varing. Open the door!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Jack Ivor's voice, high-pitched,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearful. "Don't open the door--it's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trick! Varing's one of Kilrain's gang.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don't open the door!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But footsteps sounded, a latch lift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed and the door opened. Barbara.</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood revealed in murky light, a gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her hand, and Varing saw that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows had been blinded. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't any fear or distrust on Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bara's pale face as she stood aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Kent Varing to enter. Varing</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped inside, closed it and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his back to it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">PLAINLY, preparations for a fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been made. There was an air</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tension in the room. Barbara was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed in denims and shirt. Billy</seg><seg type="columnLine">huddled on a pallet on the floor, eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide and bewildered, his puppy</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched in his arms. Jack Ivor stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall, repeating rifle in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. Ivor's face was ghastly pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his stubble of beard. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands were shaking, and stark fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed in his staring eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jack Ivor said shrilly, "Blast you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Varing, I know what you're up to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Russ Kilrain sent you. Put up your</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands or I'll cut you in two!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Please, Jack!" Barbara said sharp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. Then, "What is it, Kent?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All of you must leave here, now,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Varing said swiftly, ignoring Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ivor. "There's no time to explain."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You don't need to explain," Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bara said quietly. "Russ Kilrain, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was his name, made everythfTig</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty plain when he was here this</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening. He told us to leave, or he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Varing said to Jack Ivor, "You fool,</seg><seg type="columnLine">why haven't you taken her and the boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">away? Kilrain wasn't bluffing. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">may show up any minute."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jack Ivor was plucking nervously at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buttons on his dirty shirt. His lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed stiff. "I tried to get her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave," he whined. "I told her Kilrain</seg><seg type="columnLine">would kill us all. But she wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave. Maybe she'll listen to you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Varing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I won't" Barbara declared firmly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If we left here we'd have nothing, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">place to go. We'd be out on the prairie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">homeless, with the rain and wind in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our faces. What we have here is piti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully little, but it holds all our hopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the future. It's worth fighting for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth dying for if we have to!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are other places, Barbara,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack Ivor said pleadingly. "I--I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">I	haven't been much of a husband. I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">been weak, worthless; I've dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and the boy down with me. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave here with me, Barbara, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise you things will be different.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll get a job. I'll quit whiskey, and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other things. I'll be a man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> B a r b a r a's face was pale and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained, but she was adamant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said, "If you want to be a man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll never have a better chance than</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be one right here, tonight!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy had gotten up from the pallet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He went to Jack Ivor and looked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his fear-distorted face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm not afraid," he lisped. "My</seg><seg type="columnLine">daddy won't let anybody hurt me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack Ivor looked down at th#</seg><seg type="columnLine">youngster, as if just then aware of hi«</seg><seg type="columnLine">existance. His trembling finger*</seg><seg type="columnLine">HARDCASE OR COWARD?</seg><seg type="columnLine">97</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the curly head. He opened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips as if to speak, then closcd them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kent Varing said to Barbara, "Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">you won't leave?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shook her head. "I won't leave.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But you'd better go now, Kent; it may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be too late in a little while."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Varing shook his own head. An odd</seg><seg type="columnLine">exaltation had lifted inside him. Me</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "If you stay, Barbara, I stay.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'll fight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was nothing to do, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait. They talked little. Barbara was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet-eyed, tense. Billy huddled again</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his puppy in his arms. Jack Ivor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had quieted some; several times he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drank from the quart bottle on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mantel. But he was still nervous. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">paced the floor, the rifle in his hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARBARA had nailed thick boards</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the windows, leaving cracks</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fire through. They barricaded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors. Kent Varing crouched at a win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow, where he could watch through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chink the dim trail that snaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the narrow canyon pass three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards above the cabin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through this pass Russ Kilrain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gun-wolves would come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kent Varing smiled sardonically in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dim lamplight. Kent Varing, out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">law, waiting to fight, probably die, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very ones who had driven him out</seg><seg type="columnLine">onto the owlhoot! He knew they</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't have much of a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">against Kilrain's killers. They could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold them off a while, but there could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be but one ending.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barbara and Jack Ivor must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that too. But the girl showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">no signs of fear or regret. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to lose, perhaps nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gain. But she meant to fight. Varing</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at Jack Ivor. Ivor had paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the pallet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy's pudgy fingers were tugging</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the tattered leg of Ivor's levis. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard Billy say, "Daddy, you won't let</seg><seg type="columnLine">anybody hurt me. will you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jack Ivor started, looked down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy. He said hoarsely, "I--don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you worry, button. I--I'll take care of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you." Then Ivor went to the mantel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached a shaking hand for the bottle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kent Varing turned back to the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow. He didn't feel any contempt for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack Ivor's weakness and cowardice</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. A coyote couldn't change into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wolf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jutting against the moonlit sky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kent Varing could see dark moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains. The mountains looked friendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and inviting; the silvery moonlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming on their crests looked like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">beckoning finger. Beyond those</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains was safety for Kent Var-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing: here in this cabin was death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was yet time to ride.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kent Varing grimaced in the dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. Guns in hand, he hunkered</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower beside the window. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that midnight was almost at hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Any minute now Russ Kilrain would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He heard Billy ask, "Mummy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where's my daddy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Varing turned. Jack Ivor wasn't in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room. Now Varing remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing Ivor in the kitchen a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">while before, moving something about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strengthening the barricade, he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barbara was looking at Kent Var-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, a mute question in her eyes. Var-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing got to his feet, went into the tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">back room. Jack Ivor wasn't there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The barricade had been pulled aside;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door was slightly ajar. Jack Ivor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He replaced the barricade, returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the front room. He looked into Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bara's wide, questioning eyes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded. Barbara bowed her head, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Varing thought he heard a sob. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back to his vigil at the window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy had crossed to his mother. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked, "Where's my daddy? He said</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd take care of me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Daddy'll--be back in a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">while," Barbara said. "He'll take care</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us. You go back and lie down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harsh anger rioted through Kent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Varing. Jack Ivor was lower even than</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd thought. To save his own cow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ardly hide, Ivor had deserted his wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">and child just when they needed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">most. Varing remembered what Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bara had said a little while ago: "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you want to be a man, you'll never</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a better chance than to be one</seg><seg type="columnLine">right here, tonight!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jack Ivor hadn't taken that</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance...</seg><seg type="columnLine">2-GUN WESTERN -- 15 BIG STORIES!</seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN KENT VARING tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget about Jack Ivor. Ivor's de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sertion had cut down their already</seg><seg type="columnLine">slim chances. Barbara realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">too. Her tanned face was strained and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale in the dim light. Billy, sensing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last that something awful was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to happen, had begun to whim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kent Varing tensed suddenly. Faint,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet plainly audible on the still night</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, he heard the sound of hoofs. Eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">glued to the crack in the window, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared into the shadowy mouth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass three .hundred yards away. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see nothing, yet he knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kilrain's renegades were coming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, all at once, the canyon mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to explode in a red burst of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fury before Kent Varing's eyes. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasting roar of gunfire beat against</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eardrums, and the pass was criss-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed with writhing tongues of gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame. In the gunpowder torches he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see weird, leaping figures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kent Varing leaped to his feet. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tore the barricade from in front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, hurled his body through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening and started running toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canyon mouth. The pass was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fiery chaos of leaping flame and</seg><seg type="columnLine">boiling gunsmoke, of screaming lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yelling, confused men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Varing's pumping legs seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry him at a snail's pace toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass. He was aware that Barbara's</seg><seg type="columnLine">slim, flying figure was beside him; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see moonlight gleaming on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun in her hand. Side by side, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped into the canyon mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gunfire had slackened. Rider-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less horses were pounding along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canyon. Motionless figures lay on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. Then two mounted figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">loomed before Kent Varing. They'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen Varing and the girl in the moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, and their guns started blazing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kent Varing heard the waspish hiss of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead; he felt a fiery sting as a bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">grazed his thigh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then his own deadly guns started</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammering and flaming. He heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasting roar of Barbara's .38 beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Fresh sound beat back from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canyon walls. The shadows churned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with cyclonic gun-fury. In the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow, Varing saw one of the mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures suddenly drop his gun and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumble stiffly to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, as suddenly as it had begun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gunfire subsided. Whipped by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chill wind, gunsmoke rolled like a fog</seg><seg type="columnLine">up out of the gorge, and the ribbon of</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlight that penetrated to the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the canyon revealed six dead men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of them was Russ Kilrain. Four</seg><seg type="columnLine">others were his henchmen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sixth man was Jack Ivor. Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ivor sat with his back against a wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the still-smoking muzzle of his rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust over a boulder before him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't look scared or weak now. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">died there had been a soft smile on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack Ivor's gaunt, bearded face, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was thinking of something pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jack Ivor had said, "Don't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry, button. I--I'll take care of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you!'' And he had. He'd made it pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible for them all to live.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barbara was sobbing softly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kent Varing put his arm about her</seg><seg type="columnLine">slim figure and led her out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canyon--toward a future that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">purged of its bitterness and glowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright with promise of happiness. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">future made possible by a man who,</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid to live, had in the end found</seg><seg type="columnLine">something worth dying for. #END</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       KILLER S HERITAGE</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked for me, seein' as how I"d been</seg><seg type="columnLine">doin' a lot of night ridin' on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandit's trail--and seein' how I</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed up here today. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Webb was silent, mutely grateful</seg><seg type="columnLine">because Bert wasn't blaming him for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ugly suspicions he had nursed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But even if Bert had damned him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skies, Webb would have been hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">py at that moment.
