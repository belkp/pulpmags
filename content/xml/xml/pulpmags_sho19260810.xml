            <seg type="columnLine">lived, emerging a shaking skeleton of a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">But he managed to find three square</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">meals a day most of the time. Once he did</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">went forth to search bars and gulches for</seg>
