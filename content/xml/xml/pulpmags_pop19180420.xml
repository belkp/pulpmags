                <seg type="columnLine">the Continental Sugar Company to help survey the Zapata swamps in southern</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Cuba. His fiancee, Lola Simmons, has come with her mother to Santa Fe, hoping</seg>

                <seg type="columnLine">announces that he must leave. A fellow engineer, Burt Williams, accompanies him.</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">On the steamer from New Orleans Dawson meets S^nor Casada and his sister Alicia,</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">in whose family, it afterward develops, rests the title to the Zapata swamps.</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Although a Spanish stude'ht whom he engages to carry the chain for him tells</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Dawson that the Continental Company is planning a railway for the region, the</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">other engineers on the ground seem discouraged. Dawson hears that instructions</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">have been given by George Halderman, a boyhood acquaintance, and now general</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">manager 'of the company, to the effect that he is to have the hardest part of the</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">swamps to survey. After a perilous trip through a crocodile-infested morass, Dawson</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">is discharged by the chief engineer, Hardy, but later engaged again by Halderman.</seg>
