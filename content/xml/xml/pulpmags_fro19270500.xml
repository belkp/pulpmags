Brandon Grey had</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. Ajid to that challenge there was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, but one answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had been no more than six hours in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tangier before 1 had begun to feel a cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain tension from the atmosphere which</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung about Brandon Grey. It had begun</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we had clasped hands on the wooden</seg><seg type="columnLine">pier and had looked into each other's eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I realized at that moment that Grey was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer the careless adventurer I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">known in years gone by, who had faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me the assegais of Menelik's war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">■~tnit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">riors in Abyssinia and the multiple dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers of India and Thibet.

But what his new purpose in</seg><seg type="columnLine">life might be he did not then divulge, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not press for information. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one in whom I had entire confidence--</seg><seg type="columnLine">through strenuous experience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when in the evening I sat down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dining table as one of four guests, 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">was convinced that his mission was deeply</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned with Moroccan affairs, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">are always dangerous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morocco offered adventures, offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger, offered high achievement, even to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a foreigner, an American. I knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country somewhat, having lived there once</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a year or more; but Grey knew it in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">timately, so intimately that he spoke cas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually of matters strange to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other three guests at his dining ta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble were native gentlemen arrayed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white swathing robes of formality; dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed, dark bearded, and, except for one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair skinned. This one was brown skin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ned and yet with no trace in his features</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the negroid mixture. Of the two white</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moors I need say nothing further; they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were high officials from the office of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sultan's representative in Tangier, friends,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed, of Brandon Grey. They talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">of everything except politics. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third man. Sidi Achmed Lahya, spoke lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle; and when he did speak referred al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most invariably to the disturbed condition</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the country, to the efforts being made</seg><seg type="columnLine">by France and Germany to seize control</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to oust the reigning Sultan, or to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempts of unpatriotic Moors to create</seg><seg type="columnLine">rebellion and to place another Sultan upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throne.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had gotten, I judged, almost through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the somewhat elaborate meal, when a ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vant entered and whispered something to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brandon Grey. Excusing himself, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">host rose and left the room. In a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">he returned to the doorway and beckoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you," he asked, when I reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, "game for a night ride--and probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fight?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I told him that I was if it was not too</seg><seg type="columnLine">long a ride nor too big a fight. I was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rather soft. For the last few years my</seg><seg type="columnLine">exercise and my adventures had been few</seg><seg type="columnLine">and far between.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded and smiled, left me standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">there while he spoke to his guests; explain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, as I understood, that he had been ur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently summoned to the home of a friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been taken ill. He begged them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make themselves comfortable and com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand the servants as though they were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own homes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LOSING the door upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, Brandon Grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried me to his sleep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing quarters. From a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bureau drawer he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">hea\-y automatic pistols</seg><seg type="columnLine">with holsters and belts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He handed one to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strapped the other around his waist;</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed me clips of cartridges.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But look here, Brandon," I said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Aren't we going to change clothes? These</seg><seg type="columnLine">things--" The idea of going into a fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">in evening dress struck me as grotesque.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Not a moment to cliange, old man," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed back at me. "Let's go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where?" I managed to ask as I fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell you on the way," he said. "Let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">get going."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We reached the cobbled patio into which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that moment, a native groom led two</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddled horses. I was relieved to note that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they bore Texas saddles; were powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts. Brandon Grey beat me to sad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle, but not much. He swung his horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the gate, and I followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the open road which ran past the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, and from which the courtyard</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened, a lantern gleamed in the hands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">another groom, and by its feeble lights I</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceived brown robed, bare legged native</seg><seg type="columnLine">horsemen. And although I could not see</seg><seg type="columnLine">their faces because the hoods of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">djellabas were dropped. I could see those</seg><seg type="columnLine">points on the left shoulders which tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly as words that rifles are slung across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the backs of the riders under their gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments. '</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ride," commanded Grey, and galloped</seg><seg type="columnLine">off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I followed I could not help smiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the picture, or rather, at the two pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, of Brandon Grey and myself, for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that my own aspect resembled that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the figure ahead of me--a man in eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning clothes, the trousers already crawling</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the legs and revealing the white of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">undergarment, the feet in patent leather</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARBARY BLOOD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">5</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pumps thrust into wooden stirrups, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silly short dinner jacket blowing back, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glazed white shirt bosotn and high collar</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming phosphorescently in the starlight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and panama hat topping it all; followed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a similar apparition who in turn had at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels galloping brown shrouded native</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountaineers, with their ritles across their</seg><seg type="columnLine">backs and the Lord only knew what inten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions in their hearts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now. knowing something of the Tangier</seg><seg type="columnLine">district, it was not long before I became</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised at the route we were following.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We had skirted the main part of town</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had reached the beach, which here</seg><seg type="columnLine">curves around Tangier Bay for a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles: but in the middle of the crescent is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the River Halle; a tidal river. While we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been skirting the town I had been sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we must be headed for one of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">only roads out of town; that is, the Fez</seg><seg type="columnLine">road, which runs south; or the Tetuan</seg><seg type="columnLine">road, which runs east. We passed the Fez</seg><seg type="columnLine">road, however, and I decided it was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tetuan. But in turn we passed the Tetuan</seg><seg type="columnLine">road and reached the beach and started for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Halk River. As we were crossing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand dunes which lie above the beach I</seg><seg type="columnLine">became conscious of a peculiar warm wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming from the east. With almost every</seg><seg type="columnLine">leap of my horse it seemed to increase in</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength. By the time we had reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach it had grown stiff, was throwing up</seg><seg type="columnLine">whitecaps in the bay, the mutter of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached my ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once upon the beach there was no need</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer to ride in single file. I spurred my</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse and overtook Brandon Grey. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time I had done so we had covered an</seg><seg type="columnLine">arc of the beach crescent, bringing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind more into our faces. I felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp sting of beach sand it liad picked up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shurgy !"* I shouted as I raced along-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of Brandon Grey. He did not an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swer. We raced on, curving along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach, more and more the wind in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces. Now it was a gale. Upon it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only blinding sand but little pebbles</seg><seg type="columnLine">which cut. There was a booming across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bay; the waves broke angrily. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses shook their heads in the fusillade of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pebbles. I drew my hat down over ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes to protect them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where," I shouted, "are we going?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not, I admit, that it made very much dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference, but I knew this: there was no road</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the beach between where we were and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Halk River, nor was there anything be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween where we were and the river except</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach and sand dunes. Manifestly then,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   •Awhrcfftr</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">we were heading for the Halk River--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I noted that the tide was in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To Anghera!" Brandon Grey shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">back at me. His voice came unevenly, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind seemed to twist it, to tear the words</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pieces. I caught two more words.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wait--river-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We raced on. The pressure of the wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew greater and greater. I felt myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed backward in the saddle by its force.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It became a miniature sandstorm. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, my nose, my mouth, were full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand. My face, and hands and wrists</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned with the sting of pebbles. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">through my clothing I could feel their im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pact. And my horse felt them, too. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then he would swerve abruptly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">snort angrily. Thus like devils unchained</seg><seg type="columnLine">we galloped through that constantly in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creasing hail of sand, that constantly hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening wail of wind until abruptly I almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed into Brandon Grey, who drew his</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse to his haunches on the bank of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">River Halk. He turned as I reached him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now where?" I shouted. I'll swear</seg><seg type="columnLine">he grinned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is this Anghera?" he shouted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I knew it wasn't, of course. I knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anghera lay on the other side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brandon Grey drew his horse nearer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are going," he shouted--I knew he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shouting, although his voice was little</seg><seg type="columnLine">louder than a whisper in the bellow of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind and the hiss of the sand--"we are go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the village of El-Menar, where I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope to capture a man I want. You said</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were game."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked at the disturbed water of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river which it was his apparent intention</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cross.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I am," I declared. And I almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">added, "But this is a hell of a night for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">party.

The water reached my knees; I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that it was up to Brandon Grey's sad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle. I laughed at the picture we must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">made then. Two gentlemen in evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress in Texas saddles in the middle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Halk River in a sandstorm.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not see them, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could feel their presence, could hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased thudding of horses' hoofs, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased clanking of metal accoutrements,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the increased creaking of leather, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that the rifles had now been unslung</seg><seg type="columnLine">from brown backs and were carried across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saddle bows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We mounted the western slope of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills and tumbled down into the valley be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond.

There Brandon Grey halted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung from his saddle and gave the order</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dismount.

Now at moonrise of this same*day I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was climbing across an African hill be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the chief of the Sultan's Secret Ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vice and a file of dark faced Berber fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing men, all of us intent upon raiding a</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARBARY BLOOD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">native village and carrying off from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">protection a man who plotted the creation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a new Sultan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within the next hour other strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">things would happen; some of these feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">which now toiled up the hill might not go</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the hill again; the rifles upon these</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown backs behind me would speak and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be answered by other rifles and per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps on one of the shrieking bullets my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own name would be written. In an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps history would be written; for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could easily perceive, through my knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the temperament of the Moroccan</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, that Belabbas in death or captivity</seg><seg type="columnLine">might eliminate a real menace to the throne,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Belabbas at liberty might reorganize</seg><seg type="columnLine">the empire; for the hold of the present</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sultan upon his people was not strong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But strangest of all, it seemed to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that my old friend Brandon Grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be the man to hold the fate of em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pire in his hands. Again I had to smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the mental picture of this ambassador</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fate, with the water of the Wad-el-Halk</seg><seg type="columnLine">dripping from his shapeless trousers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mingling with the yellow dust of the An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghera hills, making his way insouciantly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a boiled shirt to attack a native village</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wrest from half a hundred fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">men the person of, as Grey had put it, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">son-of-a-gun, Belabbas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have found that adventure always</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes in smiling guise, never as a terri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fying phantom. One goes singing, a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">trick of fate and the dark wings are heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">above; they pass and one goes again upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">one's way singing. And I have noted, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that those who seek for adventure are those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who find the least of it, whereas those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">want none of it, upon them is it thrust by</seg><seg type="columnLine">perverse destiny. Truly, as I have writ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten at the start of my narrative, it is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">key of chance that opens the door to ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture--the key of chance, and never the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jimmy of intention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We came'then to the top of the hill and</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted. I perceived that a sort of plateau</seg><seg type="columnLine">or mesa spread before us and that at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance which I judged to be less than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter of a mile, a single yellow light</seg><seg type="columnLine">shone. About it was a sort of silver sheen</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I knew to be caused by the moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light shining upon the great flat cactus</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves of the wall which surrounds almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">every native village.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moonlight was unfortunate for us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but this evil was overcome by the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon our right was a chain of minor hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at the foot of this ran a shallow can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The native addressed by Brandon Grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Idrees called attention to this gully, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the fact that it ran from where we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted to a point far beyond the village of</seg><seg type="columnLine">El-Menar. All we had to do to escape the</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealing moonlight was to reach this gully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then to follow it to our destination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We did this, Idrees in the lead. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazed at the silence with which we trav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eled, until I realized that the natives had</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed their slippers and were carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">them on their backs in the hoods of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">djellabas. The only sound seemed to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the contact upon the stones of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gully of the evening slippers worn by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brandon Grey and myself. And before</seg><seg type="columnLine">we reached the village, I reflected, grimly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we would both be as barefooted as those ...</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown men who followed us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wind was from the east, so that our</seg><seg type="columnLine">little noise was held back from the village,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more important still, our scent was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried to the noses of the village dogs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE yellow light drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer and closer; we</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew near enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that it was. a lantern</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging on a post at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance to rhe village,</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed it. and halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">v again. Now Brandon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey took the lead from Idrees. Gave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief command to follow, and climbing out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gully led swiftly toward the gate</seg><seg type="columnLine">where hung the light. I followed, gained</seg><seg type="columnLine">his side, noted that he had drawn his pis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tol, and drew mine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is only one gate, of course," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung at me as we strode along. Wre</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the gate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two men on guard here," snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greyr "The others come with me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now a dog barked, and another dog, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen. Voices called. There was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of movement within the dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">thatched roof huts ranged around a central</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening, sort of a public square, necessar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily small, because the entire village was</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained within walls of cactus which did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not enclose more than three or four acres</seg><seg type="columnLine">of land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grey led swiftly to the center of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening. A match flared in his hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw him applying it to a thing that re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded me of a Roman candle such as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">use on the Fourth of July. The thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">sputtered, and bending over, Grey thrust ii</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the ground. Suddenly it burst forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a glaring blue light which illuminated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the village from end to end. As this li^ht</seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">burst forth the man Idrees shouted an or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der and the dozen natives formed a hollow</seg><seg type="columnLine">square facing toward the four sides of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">village. Thus every house, and whoever</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from them, was under the sights of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their riHes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It requires no effort of the imagination</seg><seg type="columnLine">to conceive tliat the simple natives of El-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Menar must have been startled half out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their wits by the sudden glare which</seg><seg type="columnLine">flooded the village and which must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrated many a crack and cranny of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their houses with its ghastly light. Nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">that when, tumbling out of bed to seek the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of this magical illumination they</seg><seg type="columnLine">should sec against the infernal glare the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black silhouettes of the riflemen facing</seg><seg type="columnLine">them wherever they might be. Doors</seg><seg type="columnLine">were thrown open and half clad village men</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in the doorways, blinking and open</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouthed; here and there a wide eyed wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man peered over her man's shoulder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then ducked back with a shriek; children</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to cry and the multitude of village</seg><seg type="columnLine">dogs, apparently startled into a momentary</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence, voiced their objections.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To the headman's house!" Brandon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey called over his shoulder to Idrees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This house, easily distinguishable be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause it was a little larger than the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had a little more space about it, stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the east side of the square. We went</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly toward it, but before Brandon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey's upraised pistol muzzle had time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall upon the door, it was opened and a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown man stood scowling at us. A man</seg><seg type="columnLine">becomes headman because he is less easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbed, or because he has quicker per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptions than the others. Djellali, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">headman, must have observed us from</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the house; now he addressed us</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarsely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are you and what do you want?'5</seg><seg type="columnLine">he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brandon Grey lowered the pistol until</seg><seg type="columnLine">it covered the headman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who I am does not matter," snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey. "What I want does matter.

I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In whose name," growled Djellali, "do</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you thus descend upon my village at night</seg><seg type="columnLine">with armed men ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "In the name, Djellali." answered Grey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"of His Majesty, the Sultan--and the pis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tol you perceive in my hand.

He moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pistol a little--cursed and lowered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun. For Belabbas had done an unlooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">for thing: he had dashed straight toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the muzzles of the rifles of the men held</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him from the hollow square in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light still flared.

And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next thing I saw was Belabbas 6tooping in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his run to pick up the blazing torch in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the square holding it aloft for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment while lie grinned about him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reason to grin because in the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARBARV BLOOD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ihat square he was again perfectly safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the rifles which surrounded him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he thrust the lighted end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch against the ground, and darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">came like a thunderclap upon the village.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Chapter III</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BLACK MAGICIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">N THE sudden dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, doubly dense be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of the vast bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liance of the flare, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man we sought made</seg><seg type="columnLine">his escape. The ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planation of the guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had left at the gate</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that they had been staring at the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that when it ceased to be they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly smitten blind, so blind that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not even perceive the light of the lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tern near them, let alone the figure of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">being which they heard rush past them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brandon Grey was more philosophical</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Belabbas' escape from his hands than</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had expected he would be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Elsewhere if not here," he said, shrug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging his shoulders.

Then he called Idrees and</seg><seg type="columnLine">commanded that three riflemen be brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. They crowded through the door al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most before the order was given.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," commanded Grey, "stand that</seg><seg type="columnLine">man up against the wall."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Obediently Idrees bent over Djellali,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized the big man by the arm and com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded him to stand. For a moment it</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked as though the headman was going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">put up a fight, but after he had looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the cold eyes of Brandon Grey, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three rifles which were now leveled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he rose with a grunt and Idrees</seg><seg type="columnLine">slioved him back against the wall. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">riflemen, understanding, raised their rifles;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hammers clicked as they were pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">back by brown thumbs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Now a Mohammedan does not fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">death, especially at the hands of a Chris-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">9</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tian, because Paradise awaits him. But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wirhout fearing death, he may greatly crave</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. In other words, if death must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">met, let it be met without fear; but if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">does not have to be met, so much the bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter. I observed that Brandon Grey un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstood this difference, this trick of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">native mind. Because he did not threaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">Djellali with death; but spoke to him of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pleasure of living, of eating and drink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and breathing, and watching his chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren grow up, and tilling his farm- and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting, and the undoubted opportunity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaining more and more favor in the eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Allah by acts of grace. In short, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">emphasizing life he put a terrible emphasis</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon death. And so, at last, it was Djel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lali who asked Brandon Grey what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted, instead of Brandon Grey demand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a thing from Djellali.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A trifle of information," answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey.

Our riflemen sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest in a big courtyard, Idrees threw open</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door of the house and bade us enter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then excused himself to go and see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what food was available. I took advan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tage of this opportunity to question Grey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What now?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not that I didn't think I knew; I judged</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we would have some refreshment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little rest at Idrees', then return to Grey's</seg><seg type="columnLine">house on the Marshan. Probably on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow, I reflected, my friend would start</seg><seg type="columnLine">out for Arzila, forty miles down the coast;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that I should probably ride with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he had a different idea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why," he said, "as soon as we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to eat and attend to another</seg><seg type="columnLine">little matter or two, we shall start for Ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zila."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A forty-mile ride at night--after our</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride to El-Menar and back!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are joking," I said, although I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew he was not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not on your life. The chances are that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Belabbas is already 011 his way--or rather,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he will be on his way as soon as he can</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk in from Anghcra and get a horse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I propose to reach there first, not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prevent him from warning Mulai Mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammed, but to try again to catch him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," I objected, "would he believe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Djellali would divulge Mulai Mohammed's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiding place?" That seemed to me im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">probable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He might not think he would," an-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">swered Grey, "but he might fear he would;</seg><seg type="columnLine">at any rate that would be the only thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would have to fear."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't think myself tKat Djellali</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have told you if the child had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered when he did,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nor I," agreed Grey. "Sheer luck."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again, I thought, the key of chance had</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened another door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And so we ride to Arzila--now--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in these clothes?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brandon Grey laughed as he surveyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">my bedraggled figure and no doubt woe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">begone face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not so," he answered. "In half an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour two beggars with ragged djellabas</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be on their way to Arzila. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">beggars will be Philip Dale and Brandon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Matters eventuated as he had said. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate of Idrees' kesk'soo and baked chicken</seg><seg type="columnLine">and luscious grapes, drank many cupfuls</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sweet tea, and then, discarding the gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of super-civilization, donned beg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gar's rags. Dirt from the roadway on our</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and arms and faces, ashes from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire-pots rubbed into our tousled hair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">filthy bandages w-rapped around his neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">and both my forearms, dilapidated slippers</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon our feet, we looked like two rem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nants of misery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why," I asked, "don these things here?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why not wait until we get to Arzila?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"One can ride as well in these as in</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other garments," Grey explained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Moreover, we must pass on foot through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city; horses will be waiting for us on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other side."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so it came about that we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed through the eastern gate by a night</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchman who grumbled at being aroused</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a couple of beggars, but who let us</seg><seg type="columnLine">through, nevertheless, and we took up our</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey through the sleeping city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just after we passed the mosque of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hulai Hassan. Brandon Grey pointed to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">barred and shuttered window in the sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond story of a house upon our right hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That," he said, "is where lives the</seg><seg type="columnLine">famous El Habib, the Black Magician,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Master of Innumerable Djinns. Quite a</seg><seg type="columnLine">character." He chuckled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As if in answer to his whispered words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we reached a door set deeply into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of the house he had pointed out, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door opened and the moonlight fell upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vast figure standing on the threshold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A vast black figure of a Sudanese negro,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swathed in black garments. His chin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead and cheeks and nose seemed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver where the moonlight struck them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARBARY BLOOD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ii</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here a moment, beggars,*' he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly. "I have alms for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It struck me that this was not so good,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that Grey would probably ignore the</seg><seg type="columnLine">summons. Wherefore I shuffled steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the cobbles until my companion stop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped me with a hand upon my arm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled me toward the doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are dumb. Say nothing," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered under his breath. And then in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arabic he whined, in the voice of the beg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gar the world over, "Alms, Sidi. Alms in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the name of Allah the Compassionate,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went up to the big negro. I tagging</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his heels. He thrust out a dirty paw</seg><seg type="columnLine">and repeated his solicitation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was watching the magician. I saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlight shatter on his face as it wrinkled</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a grin showing his white teeth. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">change startled me, but even more start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling was the deep guffaw of laughter which</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed the grin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So! So!" he said, having rid himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the guffaw. "So we have two beggars</seg><seg type="columnLine">who are going on a journey; a long jour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney; as far, I think, as--let us say--Ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zila. " My knees nearly let me drop. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey was of sterner stuff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Alms, Sidi," he whined. "Alms." I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to admire his nerve, and while doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">so realized that I was standing with open</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth staring at the Black Magician as at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ghost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," He continued, "to Arzila, I think.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Good. And instead of alms I will give</seg><seg type="columnLine">you something worth more than alms. Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">assuredly worth more than many alms. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean advice. And that advice is to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">note of the fifth house on the right hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the street beyond the Tangier gate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Arzila." He guffawed again, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">quieted as suddenly as he had laughed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And," he went on, "being a magician,</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally I make charms of value. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">one for you. It is better than alms."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Into Brandon Grey's still outstretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand he laid what appeared to be a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">square of folded paper, bent the fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to hold it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This charm," he said, "may bring good</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortune to two beggars in Arzila.

Bran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don Grey looked at me, and I looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brandon Grey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hmph!" uttered Brandon Grey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed to me that that did not cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Chapter IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BY THE TANGIER GATE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE uncanny knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mysterious words</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Black Magician</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a jolt to Grey, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think, even more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me. My astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment was due chiefly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man's apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of our mission, to his weird</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognition of us in our beggar's rags, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that he appeared to have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting in the doorway for us to pass; in</seg><seg type="columnLine">short, I was aghast that anyone should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have possessed such knowledge as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to possess. That he had secured</seg><seg type="columnLine">it through magic and djinns I was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to believe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The effect, however, upon Grey--I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to judge this from his occasional mutter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings addressed not to-'me, but to himself--</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be different. Apparently he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the Black Magician's operations</seg><seg type="columnLine">something bigger than I was able to per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceive. And when, in a sheltering nook,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he paused to light a match and inspect the</seg><seg type="columnLine">charm which El Habib had given him, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was disappointed at what he did not say.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He held the match and folded paper so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might see--and all I saw was a tangle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">arabesque lines shaped roughly like an out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread hand--and then grunted something</seg><seg type="columnLine">unintelligible and started off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nevertheless, El Habib did not change</seg><seg type="columnLine">our plans. We found Idrees waiting with</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses as he had been instructed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning found us squatting upon the cob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bles at the side of the street just within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tangier gate of Arzila. We had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted before daybreak outside the walls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Idrees had led our horses to the south-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern gate where, upon its opening, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to enter and put the beasts into some con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venient fonda or caravanserai. And when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gate had been opened by the city guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had made our way through in a group</seg><seg type="columnLine">of countrymen gathered to attend market-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. and had taken up our seat by the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the road to raise our voices now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then in a duet of *'Alarbi--alarbi! Alms</seg><seg type="columnLine">--alms!" and to watch for Belabbas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had visited Arzila once some years</seg><seg type="columnLine">12</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">before, and had thought then what a mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nificent sanctuary it would be for a bandit</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang, or as the headquarters for a revolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. It is a walled town, several square</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles of massed buildings surrounded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">red sandstone walls fifty feet high in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">places, and almost as thick. These walls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 knew, were honeycombed with secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">passages and forgotten rooms which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">superstitious natives had sealed up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten because of their fear and belief</seg><seg type="columnLine">that evil spirits dwelt therein.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Time was when a hundred thousand peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple had their homes in Arzila; now I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the population to he not over two thousand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Which meant, of course, that thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thousands of the residences--each one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which joined 011 to others, so that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole town, it might be said, was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">under one flat roof--were deserted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling into decay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had thought to myself when in Arzila</seg><seg type="columnLine">before that an army could be hidden in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruins, and another army in the secret cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers of the great wall, did fear of spirits</seg><seg type="columnLine">not deter them from opening the passage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways. It occurred to me now, as I squat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted there beside Brandon Grey, almost un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the feet of passing pedestrians and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts of burden, that men like Belabbas</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mulai Mohammed were far less super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stitious than the common citizen, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspected that what I had thought of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantages of Arzila for revolutionary</seg><seg type="columnLine">purposes had also occurred to others.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wise men, I have noticed, control the ig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">norant because they lack superstition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is to say, conventions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I	had not forgotten the admonition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">El Habib not to ignore the fifth house</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the right hand side of the street, inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gate. Wre were seated in front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third house on the left hand side, where-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the house in question was plainly vis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible. Perhaps I should say that the fifth</seg><seg type="columnLine">door was plainly visible, for that was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only indication of an individual residence</seg><seg type="columnLine">existing independently behind the solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of the street. There happened to be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">irregularity of roof heights here to indicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">different buildings, only the blank yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall with iron studded doors set deeply into</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and an occasional foot-square airhole</seg><seg type="columnLine">up near the roof line. What was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the wall which surrounded the fifth</seg><seg type="columnLine">door I could not guess. No inspiration</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from its blank lace. It looked just</seg><seg type="columnLine">like all the rest of the street. In this veil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of house faces as well as of women's</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces, is one of the mysteries of Morocco.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The door, while I watched, did not open,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nor did anyone even pause before it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had sat there, I judge, almost two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours, and Belabbas had not come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He must have beaten us," muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey, leaning toward me. This was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first word he had uttered for an hour and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second time only that he had spoken</seg><seg type="columnLine">since we had sat there. Apparently he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that I needed no instruction and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">did seeun obvious that when Belabbas rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the gate the thing to do was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow him. But as I say, no Belabbas</seg><seg type="columnLine">came; and I was mentally agreeing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey's words when, casting another look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the fifth door, 1 saw the figure of an as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ftari. a native soldier, leaning against it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, askaris infest all the towns of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morocco. They are no more uncommon</seg><seg type="columnLine">than policemen in an American town, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">like policemen, they have a right to lean</seg><seg type="columnLine">up against things as they are inclined.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nevertheless, I watched this fellow, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quite typical of his caste. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown, wore the red fez, red coat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">baggy yellow pantaloons of the askaris;</seg><seg type="columnLine">was bare legged, with his feet in worn yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low slippers, and he carried a rifle. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to call Grey's attention to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped because it seemed useless; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">did so suddenly because the door had</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened a little ways and the askari had</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped inside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I saw him," answered Grey, "just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he disappeared.

This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the houses which, Grey explained,</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, he kept in almost all the important</seg><seg type="columnLine">towns, ready to receive him at any hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in any guise in which he might ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear. Now he was engaged in changing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his clothes, during which operation he</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked to me more than he had talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">since the beginning of our adventure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he repeated, "guns for the lion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a snare for the birds.

It tore</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the rotten wood. The man behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dgor tried in vain to close the portal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but could not because the gun-stock pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vented. We threw ourselves against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and forced it open. The crowd be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind us set up a cheer. Grey closed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and bolted it. We found ourselves in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long, dimly lighted hall at the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which a large light room was distinguish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able. Grey handed the rifle back to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a motion to guard the man we drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of us, and drew his saber. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a door slam as we strode toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room ahead. There was nobody in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, but two doorways opened from it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In one the door was open, showing another</seg><seg type="columnLine">door at the end of a hall in the rear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. Grey threw open the other door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was unoccupied. I looked about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main room, saw in front of one of the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor cushions a little table gaudily painted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on which lay paper, bamboo pen and a bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle of ink. Grey picked up a sheet of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper, studied it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mulai Mohammed." he said, "was here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think. Here is a letter he might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">written. His signature is not on it, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ink is not yet dry: it was not finished.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let us try the other door."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as we turned toward it a velvet</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging on the side of the hall leading to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door in question was thrown aside; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure sprang into view, threw open the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and disappeared. It was the man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the askari costume.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We ran to the door, tried to pull it open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not do so. A bolt on the other side</seg><seg type="columnLine">held it. We were stopped. Brandon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey growled and studied the door. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">again took the rifle from my hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepping back began to pump the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullets into the oak. The gun was a .45-</seg><seg type="columnLine">70, throwing a bullet which would stop a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion. Before its attack a hole appeared in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the splintered oaken barrier. Brandon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey returned the gun to me, reached a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand through the hole he had made, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled the bolt which held the door. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung it open ; a draught of cold, damp air</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck us. We passed through the door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way and found ourselves in a stone walled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stone roofed and stone paved passage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, damp and fungus-grown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were inside the great wall of Arzila,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its unknown secret corridors and hid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARBARY BLOOD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T5</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">den chambers. The wall had swallowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up Belabbas and his master, the false Mu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lai Mohammed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly we were in darkness, darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">following: a loud crash. I turned to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light behind through the hole which my</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle had splintered in the woodwork of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. The door was closed. I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bolt thrown. As I sprang toward it I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard additional crashes against the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that the man we had left in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room was piling against it any object which</seg><seg type="columnLine">might prevent our opening it, even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">we again used the rifle as a key. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">use of the rifle was unnecessary. I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered that the bolt on that side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door was located just below the hole we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had created. I reached through it, pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bolt and threw mj'self against the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But there was no give to it. Grey came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my aid, but our shoulders were of no avail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even as we pushed, only managing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">move the door a little at the top, that mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was stopped by a timber which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown against the portal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not only were Belabbas and Mulai Mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammed, and the Lord knew who else,</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the city wall, but we two were also</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners there, without food, without wa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, and without light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Chapter VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CRY IN THE DARK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HAT there was a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, a way out which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men we sought had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken, was clear; but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was equally clear that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we did not know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'ay, and that, should</seg><seg type="columnLine">we happen to stumble</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it, we might find ourselves blocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">by barred and immovable doors. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to me highly probable, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if we wandered about in the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">we would become completely lost. I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not help thinking that if this happened our</seg><seg type="columnLine">world would never know of our fate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was true that many people had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">us enter the house, but it was probable</seg><seg type="columnLine">that yery few of them would await</seg><seg type="columnLine">our coming out, and eventually those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited the longest would go on their way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">either because their affairs pressed, or be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause they feared that some event had oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curred within the house which might get</seg><seg type="columnLine">them into the hands of the law as witnesses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 could not help remembering the blank</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead look of the fifth door in the wall. 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">imagined it still turning that same cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">frown upon all passersby, hiding what</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on behind it as a mask hides the</seg><seg type="columnLine">features of a Chinese actor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My thoughts had taken scarcely the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">of two breaths; were interrupted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice of Grandon Grey asking if I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">matches. There was no need to look. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered that I had none. I told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have one only," he told me. "I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered to slip my match box into my</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket, but there is only one match in it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We're out of luck. That one we will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep for an emergency. Now the prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lem is, not to get lost. Is your memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">good?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I told him it was, and asked why.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Because," he explained, "we have got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remember every turn and the number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">paces we take between each. If we had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">light we could make note of them and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be simple, but as it is, we have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember them. And if we want to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trace our steps we will have to remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">them backwards."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That will serve for a little while," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed, "but not for long." An idea oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curred to me. "What say we find a w-ord</seg><seg type="columnLine">or phrase which will have the same num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of letters as there are paces between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the turns? Words are more easily re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered than figures."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Excellent," approved Grey. "We can</seg><seg type="columnLine">make up a sentence which will have some</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning and thus easily remember it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let's start. You trail your hand along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left hand wall, and I will follow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. No telling on which side the turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be." So we started, counting paces to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether--one--two--three-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were, I realized, walking in a line</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the wall, not following it longitud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inally, and therefore we could not take</seg><seg type="columnLine">many paces without finding a turn. _ As</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had counted nine my hand slipped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall into space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nine paces," I repeated, "and here's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a turn. Is there one on that side?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grey proceeded a few steps and felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">around and said there was not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A nine letter word, or phrase, then, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin with," he said. I suggested the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word "traveling."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Correct," endorsed Grey, "and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a left turn. Therefore we have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember the words 'traveling left.' Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">let's proceed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following the same method we passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the longitudinal corridor until simul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taneously the two of us said, "Stop! We</seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">16</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone forty paces and at the same time</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reached a cross passage,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A phrase of forty words or letters</seg><seg type="columnLine">then," began Grey--and fell silent, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure on my arm which I understood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slight as the sound was I had heard it</seg><seg type="columnLine">also. The sound of men breathing, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men trying to breathe noiselessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We stood, it was clear, at an intersec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of a passageway which ran parallel to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the length of the wall, and one which cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">across it, so that on each side of us in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lateral passageway was a short corridor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in one of these corridors were human</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings. Belabbas, the one calling himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mulai Mohammed--pro!ably others. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange part of it was that because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some peculiar acoustic property of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passageway, 1 could not determine on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which side of us they were; the slight hiss</seg><seg type="columnLine">of breathing seemed to come from both</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides the same.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No doubt the men pursued knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were only two; there was no doubt in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind that they intended to attack, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which direction? Standing there</seg><seg type="columnLine">with drawn pistol I seemed to hear their</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing behind me and before me as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as on either side. It was confusing. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">this moment Grey's lips approached my</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear. "1 am going to use our only match,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he whispered. "Be ready and watch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor on your left."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I heard the sound of a match striking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw nothing in the corridor down which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was looking, and turned my head just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey's pistol roared. The two of us went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in a heap beneath our assailants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">\vhose number I could not determine, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fact I liad no time to think about. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol had been knocked from my hand as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I fell and I felt strong fingers seeking for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I fought l&gt;ack, rolled over, crawled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways with the man on my back, twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Then I felt a hard lump beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">my shoulder, reached for it and clutched</seg><seg type="columnLine">my pistol. The hands were now at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat. It was difficult to breathe, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that the man was much more</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful than myself. Therefore with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out any other movement, I laid the barrel</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my pistol upon my neck, pointing back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, and fired three shots as quickly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could pull the trigger. The hands upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">my neck relaxed, a great silence fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I scrambled to my feet and called to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey. No answer. No motion. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound. I took a step and my foot came in</seg><seg type="columnLine">contact with a body. I felt* for its heart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat. There was none, but the man had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a beard and so was not Brandon Grey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Probably he was the man I had shot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I walked around in a circle, as I thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there were no more bodies, living or</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead. I was alone in the passageway, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">besides that, I realized with a sickening</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensation that I was utterly lost as tu di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection; I could determine the cross pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ageway, all right, but I would not be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell which way we had come along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main corridor. What had become of Grey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our assailants? The answer seemed ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vious. The latter had taken Grey, dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">or alive, into some other part of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I am not ashamed to admit that my knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew weak, that I sat down upon the cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">damp stones and regretted that the key of</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance had ever opened for me this par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticular door of adventure. Death by hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger or by thirst is bad enough when it oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curs in company with a fellow-being; when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it occurs in such a place as permits one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the sun or the stars. But to be buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive in a city wall, to starve and thirst in</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness and alone until death should re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve one's sufferings, was a thought which</seg><seg type="columnLine">sapped such little courage as I had. Better</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quick death which might be facing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brandon Grey at the hands of his enemies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">than this!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But after a little I rose and in sheer des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peration started off, leaving the question</seg><seg type="columnLine">of route in the hands of fate. When I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone some thirty steps I knew that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the longitudinal passageway, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not know, nor care, whether it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading me back toward the house by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tangier gate, or away from it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I continued on in utter blackness until</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sharp cry brought me to a sudden halt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cry seemed to come from a little dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance ahead of me. But it was not a man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry; it was the cry of a woman, or a girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went forward, listening intently. Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the cry. a cry of pain or fear, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time seemingly from the w'all beside me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I passed my hands over the wall, thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">that possibly there was a door which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not see. They came in contact with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a heavy wooden framework in which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">jagged projections of rusty metal. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">first I thought I had found the door I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">visioned there, but, feeling over it a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, I realized that it was a window, once</seg><seg type="columnLine">protected by an iron grill which had rusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. Also I discovered that it was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed by wooden shutters which gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly beneath the light pressure of my.</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now the ciy came again, followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARBARY BLOOD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">17</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">by a woman's frightened voice pleading in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spanish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No cs vcrdad, Francisco! No cs ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dad!--It is not true, Francisco! It is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">true! I swear that it is not true! Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not kill me, Francisco! Do not--" The</seg><seg type="columnLine">words rose to another scream of terror.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I pushed against the window shutters and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they gave beneath the pressure. But no</seg><seg type="columnLine">light came through them and I realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a curtain or wall hanging concealed the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">window. The woman's scream had died</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a gurgle, and I pictured unpleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. Gun in hand I swung through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window, flung aside the curtain and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">up within the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GIRL with loosened</seg><seg type="columnLine">long black hair was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent backward over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's knee; liis fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">W'ere on her throat, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth was open and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes were staring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man was a Span-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iard ; dark, villainous looking, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood-red sash around his waist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had not heard me, did not know I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was there until the barrel of my pistol der</seg><seg type="columnLine">scended upon his head. Probably he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know I was there even then, because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell unconscious to the floor, the girl roll-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from his suddenly limp knee to lie be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the work of a moment to unwrap</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long red sash from the Spaniard's waist</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to truss him up with it.

There was none,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I let the curtain drop into place again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned back to the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thank you a thousand times, senor,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she began, hesitantly. "But--but-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw her eyes scrutinize me up and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">down, realized that I still appeared to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">native askari, and that for one of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupid fellows to rescue a woman from</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger was rightly a matter of surprise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not that they are cowardly, but they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very deep-seated belief in tending to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own affairs only and that Allah, with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out their assistance, will rescue from dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger those whom he desires to be rescued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While I was thinking thus I had time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to notice that the girl was strikingly hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some in a Spanish way.

Her eyes were as black as her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair, wrhich was utterly so. Her features</seg><seg type="columnLine">were well formed, although unduly flushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">now by her recent experience. And more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than this, there was a look of intelligence</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her eyes which many a handsome Span-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish woman lacks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was in doubt as to my course of ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. I realized that through the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had entered a house built up against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city wall, that I was out of that dread, dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">dungeon. But I had to go back in search</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Brandon Grey. That had been my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought before I had found the window,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I had heard the cry. To get out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall, secure a lantern or candles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">go back in search of my friend. But fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ordained that I should gain my free-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom by passing through the quarrel of an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other man and a woman. Of the man I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made a mortal enemy, or I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know Spaniards. Of the woman---yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was true, too--of the woman I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a mortal friend, or I did not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spanish women. Even though I was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Moorish askarifilthy from the dirt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city wall, clothes torn by the fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">therein, even thus the woman looked upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">me with eyes of gratitude.

I myself was lost, having no</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, until I heard your scream and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a corridor some six</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet wide, I judged, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a third again as high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">damp and mouldy in spots, dry and dusty</seg><seg type="columnLine">in others. The floor of it was of stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">slabs and the walls seemed to have been at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one time covered with plaster, judging</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the heaps of white dust which lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">along their bases.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our lanterns gave but little light, threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">their yellow beams a distance of only a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards; hence I moved forward slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching the distant darkness for what</seg><seg type="columnLine">might materialize out of it. I judged that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had gone thirty-five or forty paces when</seg><seg type="columnLine">something did materialize; namely, a wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of which a corridor turned off on</seg><seg type="columnLine">each hand. Warning the senorita, I ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached cautiously; similar lateral corri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dors had not long since held an ambush.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gun in hand I peeked cautiously around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner. But the corridors were quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty. ^ Thereupon, faced by the blank</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, I investigated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was this peculiarity, however--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the passageway we were in came to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">end in the lateral corridors, and the height</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these, and of the opposing wall, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be treble that of the passageway behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. In other words the cross-wall which</seg><seg type="columnLine">confronted me was like the side of a house</seg><seg type="columnLine">built into the city wall--or the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some big room which stretched completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the barrier. We came out of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel into an open space and ahead was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wall some twenty-five feet high, and, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to me, almost the width of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city wall itself. In it I could perceive no</seg><seg type="columnLine">door or opening of any sort. In my first</seg><seg type="columnLine">examination, tliat was. As I walked along</seg><seg type="columnLine">it the second time, in one corner I saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glittering disc lying half imbedded in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crumbled mortar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I fished it out and stared at it startled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was an American silver dollar. That it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fallen from above was apparent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therefore I looked up, lifting my lantern</seg><seg type="columnLine">as high as I could, and a dozen feet above</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">19</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> my head I distinguished a hole in the wall</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a couple of feet square.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Two and two combined with a click.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Brandon Grey had passed here and the sil-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ver dollar had either fallen from his pocket</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or had been dropped from him with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thought that it might serve as a guide for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me if I should search for him. And as I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had found it in a corner of one of the lat-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eral corridors, directly beneath the open-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing above my head, it seemed reasonable to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">suppose that my friend had passed through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that opening to the other side of the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But how?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I could conceive of several ways in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which he and his captors--for I had no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">doubt that he was a captive--could have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gained the opening. But these ways were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">closed to me at the moment. A rope</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">might have been let down to them from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the room beyond, or a rope ladder lowered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But I had neither rope nor ladder, and if</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I had possessed either one of these instru-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ments I failed to see how I could have at-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tached it to the opening above. Perplexed,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yet vowing to pass that wall, I leaned back</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">against the side of the corridor and raised</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my lantern in order to see as far into the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hole as possible, to determine, if I could,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">. how thick the wall before me was. For-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tune favored me. From this angle I saw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a yellow curve maybe a handsbreadth in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">length, which was undoubtedly a segment</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of rope. So, I thought, the rope or the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ladder by which they ascend or descend is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">kept in that hole. Remained, then, for me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to devise a scheme by which I could get</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hold of the piece of rope which I saw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Not a difficult task, providing I could find</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a pole and a bit of wire to fashion a hook</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out of. And naturally the only place the^e</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">things were to be secured was in the house</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we had just left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Come,'' I said to the senorita, "we must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> go back to your house." I explained what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I needed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   This was the first time I had spoken</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">since we had reached the spot. My voice</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seemed strangely suppressed, thrown back</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upon my ears by the surrounding walls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The girl turned toward the passageway</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and I started to follow, when I heard mv</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">name called, as from a far distance. I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">recognized the voice, and in fact, there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could be no one else who would so call my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Grey!" I shouted. "Where are you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "The other side the wall," came the an-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> swer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I moved back to my former position be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> neath the hole in the wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">20</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you all right?" I asked him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The answer floated back through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole above my head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Not all right," he said, "but still alive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Get to me if you can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am going to," I told him. "I am go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing now after the means wherewith to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach this hole in the wall. Are you tied</seg><seg type="columnLine">up?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Worse than that," lie answered. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am not only tied up, but I am chained into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stone tub into which they have turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water. It's some ancient torture cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber, I think."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shuddered. The picture was vivid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But there is only a little water coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">in," Grey continued. "It's intended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drip slowly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How long wilt it take--" I began, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not finish. But Grey understood</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have been trying to figure it," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">called back. "I don't think it will reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">my neck for twenty hours, perhaps more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps less. I can only guess at it. Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viding, of course, the water doesn't come</seg><seg type="columnLine">any faster than it does now. Better bring a</seg><seg type="columnLine">file or a saw when you come. And be</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful, too, when you return. They may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be here and I may be unable to warn you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AM going," I told him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with the word I set</seg><seg type="columnLine">off, quivering with hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror at the thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friend's danger. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">make it worse, if that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were possible, I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">read of this form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">punishment and torture and death. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">psychological torture. A torture of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind more even than of the body. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone basin, the sides rising higher than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the victim's head, a man was shackled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">chains fastened to the bottom of the tub.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two short chains held his hands down, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">others passed over his knees. Thus the</seg><seg type="columnLine">victim could not rise, could not move ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept perhaps to sway his body three or</seg><seg type="columnLine">four inches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the water was permitted to drip</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the tub. After a little the pain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cramped muscles, of water-soaked flesh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of perception of the water rising with such</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible slowness, gave way to the horror</seg><seg type="columnLine">of counting the drops as they fell. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last after the mind had been torn by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inescapable count, it had to face that awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment in which each globule of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">became more and more deadly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, it was in haste that I led the way</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the senorita's house. The girl kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my heels, followed me through the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow and then gave a cry. Looking at her</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw her pointing to the comer of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room where I had left the Spaniard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no Spaniard there. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I had tied him with no gentleness</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatsoever, he was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh." cried the girl. "He lias escaped!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He will return and--and-- Let us go, ]</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly. I am afraid."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The quicker the better," I told her, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking of Brandon Grey, and not of the j</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spaniard. He was unimportant. The I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiling to do with all speed was to gain ac- I</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess to the torture chamber where water!</seg><seg type="columnLine">dripped on Brandon Grey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A pole of some sort, girl," I told her.]</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And quickly. A bit of wire." I looked j</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the room and could see nothing that]</seg><seg type="columnLine">would serve. Realizing that I still held!</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lantern I set it down upon the floor;]</seg><seg type="columnLine">then noticed the wire handle by which l]</seg><seg type="columnLine">had carried it. Good. That would doj</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the wire perfectly. I tore it loose from!</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tin case.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look you, senor," the girl cried fromj</seg><seg type="columnLine">another room into which she had gone.]</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Will this serve the purpose?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I entered, and found her holding a good j</seg><seg type="columnLine">sized bundle of what at first I took to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">brass curtain rods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," I answered. "Yes, we can make</seg><seg type="columnLine">them serve," and took them from her hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I discovered that they were not cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain rods, but cleaning rods for rifles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hmph! This is queer," I said. "These</seg><seg type="columnLine">l&gt;elong to your cousin ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where there are cleaning rods for rifles</seg><seg type="columnLine">there must be rifles," I told her. "Does</seg><seg type="columnLine">your cousin, by any chance, sell rifles?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The girl seemed embarrassed, hesitated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, senor. I--I think he does," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said at last. "I think that he has a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nection with a factory in Barcelona."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I began to understand the presence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these two Spaniards in Arzila, where there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not, so far as I knew, half a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europeans all told. That was what sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised me when I had come upon the girl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now it seemed fairly certain that her cou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sin was selling contraband arms. And it</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly flashed into my mind that con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traband arms went very well with the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volution being planned by Mulai Moham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">med and Belabbas, particularly as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spaniard was sojourning foi the town</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was apparently Mulai Mohammed's</seg><seg type="columnLine">headquarters. I decided, on the moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Spaniard was of some importance</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARBARY BLOOD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">21</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">after all; that the next time he fell into my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands I would see to it that lie didn't es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, I had the wire necessary to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hook and cleaning rods could be lashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">together to form a pole. This would give</seg><seg type="columnLine">me access to the torture chamber. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thing more I needed, a file or a saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would cut metal. Little chance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find such a thing here. The girl, when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">told her of my need, shook her head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am certain, senor," she said, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is no such thing in the house. I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">look--we will search--but-- Senor, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is nearby a shop of a v/orker in brass--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who makes cups and trays and such</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. He would have such an instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, would he not?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nearby, you say?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh. very near, senor," she answered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I think it is but the third or fourth house</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good," I said. "I will go and get that</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I need. Close the door and bolt it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and be ready to let me in quickly when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">return." I went to the door and laid my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand upon the latch. As I did so, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung open and the Spaniard plunged into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room with two scowling natives at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I jumped back and reached for the pis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tol which I had returned to the holster in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side my jacket, but before I could grasp it</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Spaniard was upon me like a tiger. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a knife in his hand and I had imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately to abandon the attempt to reach my</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol in order to grasp the hand that held</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knife. Fortunately I got the Spaniard</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the wrist with my left hand and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flected his blow. Then I sent an uppercut</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his chin which had all the strength I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could transmit to it. But it failed of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">objective. The Spaniard saw it coming,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved his head quickly, but not quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to keep my fist from landing upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his jaw. He staggered. Even as I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck with my right, I twisted his wrist</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply with my left and heard the knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinkle on the floor. But before I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">even think of picking it up the Spaniard</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped upon me, taking another blow as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did so, and overcoming my balance, bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we fell I remember seeing the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives standing inactive just inside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, and the senorita with the backs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hands placed to her lips staring horri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied. Then the blows which the Spaniard</seg><seg type="columnLine">was raining upon my face prevented fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther attention to anything except them, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thought of the knife which lay some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">where near us. I saw him glancing about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as he rained blows upon my head;</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew what he was looking for. Summon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing all my strength I managed to throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">him off of me, away from the knife. Roll-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over, then, before he could recover I</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized the weapon, turned to meet him on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my knees, heard a cry from the senorita--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then a great blaze exploded in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I regained con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sness, realization</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhat had happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. My eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">;d me so that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">L scarcely raise the</seg><seg type="columnLine">but when I did so</seg><seg type="columnLine">aw the place where</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was, I remembered. Unconsciously I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to move. Consciously I perceived</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was bound so tightly that I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">move nothing but my head. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark in the room; my eyes sought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows, saw that it was darkening out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. And then remembrance of Brandon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey crashed down upon me like a thun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derclap. My fight with the Spaniard had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken place shortly after midday, I judged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would soon be dark, and darkness did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not fall early. I guessed it to be fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight o'clock. Six precious hours at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed--for six hours Brandon Grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been expecting aid that had not come</seg><seg type="columnLine">--for more than six hours the interminable</seg><seg type="columnLine">drip, drip of water in his tub had been go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A wave of rage succeeded the wave of</seg><seg type="columnLine">despair which shook me. I strained at</seg><seg type="columnLine">my bonds, twisted and turned--and failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to accomplish any loosening of them what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soever. My head spun, lights flashed be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore my eyes at the effort. I lay quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">then for a moment thinking that it did no</seg><seg type="columnLine">good to lose control of myself. No, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to do was to try to ascertain how my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands were tied and with what, and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible, to set them free. Unless I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do so Brandon Grey would die. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spanish girl had probably been carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, perhaps killed; the ropes which</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound my wrists spelled either life or death</seg><seg type="columnLine">for my friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so I concentrated upon those ropes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I grew sick again when I discovered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by raising my head sufficiently to see, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">each wrist was twice encircled by a stout</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope, doubly knotted, and that the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrists were connected by a rope which</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed completely around my body, thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">making it impossible for me to bring my</seg><seg type="columnLine">22</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hands closely enough together so that one</seg><seg type="columnLine">might fuss at the knots which held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. There were ropes around my knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">and around my ankles. These I saw, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not feel, because my legs were numb.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And finally 1 discovered that the rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">which connected my wrists and encircled</seg><seg type="columnLine">my body was so fastened to the floor as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevent my turning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I recalled the manner in which I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">roped the Spaniard, and of how he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently escaped with ease. And I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered, too, that the bony structure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some men's hands is such that they cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">be manacled; that they may withdraw their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands through a manacle no larger than</seg><seg type="columnLine">their wrist. I knew the trick of expand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing one's muscles when one is being bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that when the muscles are relaxed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonds wall be loose. But of this knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge I had had no opportunity to make use.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I also remembered bitterly that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands were none too small, even for a man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And after all these considerations I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have given a Chinese cash for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance of escape--or for Brandon Grey's</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance for life. I am something of a fat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alist, but never until that moment did I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize the shallowness of fatalism. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossibility of it when every particle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, mind and spirit cries out that a thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall not be!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 wondered that the Spaniard had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed me outright. That assuredly had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been his intention when he had attacked me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the knife. What had happened af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter that attack, could not so far as I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, make him desire to be more lenient.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps he had some use he intended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make of me; perhaps he had discovered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white skin beneath the shirt and jacket and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had held his hand in order to try to unravel</seg><seg type="columnLine">that mystery. Or perhaps, if the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin had not been discovered, the natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">had prevented the killing of one of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However that might be, I knew that un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less I could secure my freedom before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tub in the torture chamber should be filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by that cursed dripping, I would desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all my heart that the Spaniard had</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged the knife into my unconscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. I should have been on guard every</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, at least so long as my friend's life</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay in my hands, I thought bitterly. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-reproach gained nothing: I turned my</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention again to my bonds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I made no further progress in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ensuing hour than I had made before. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was entirely dark now, and somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">there began a faint tap-tap-tap, which took,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the sound of dripping water--although</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew it was^not. It tried to drive me</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad. My wrists had swollen now. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">first I could turn them slightly in the rings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rope which encircled them. Now they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were chafed and bleeding and swollen, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not. At last, setting my teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the pain, I tried to pull one hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the circle by main force, at any ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pense, even though the flesh should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripped from that hand; but the effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved useless. It hurt excruciatingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the hones of the hand were too big to</seg><seg type="columnLine">permit its passage. I had to give up at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last, to admit that the thing I had to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">was impossible. If only I could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the rope, anywhere, with two fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers only, I could have plucked it apart in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, fiber by fiber. But I could not.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And so, giving up the effort I lay there in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness, trying to think of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">miracle I might perform. But no inspira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion came, and no miracle, and the hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I judged that it was near midnight when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard the sound of slippers proceeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the street. They stopped. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a gentle knocking upon the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">startling me, for in all of my thoughts it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not occurred to me that anyone, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept perhaps the Spaniard, would come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tliis house. It was not the Spaniard now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he would not have knocked. The sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mons was repeated Well, I thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever comes can not be as bad as what</seg><seg type="columnLine">is; wherefore I called in Arabic for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">visitor to enter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I heard the door swung open, heard foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps in the room, but the darkness was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete that I could not even perceive</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outline of the figure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Senor Francisco?" questioned my un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen visitor. He spoke in Spanish, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew from the guttural tones of his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was a native, and his question sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested to me a plan of escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sidi Francisco is not here," I replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Arabic. "If you have matches will you</seg><seg type="columnLine">not make a light? My friend, Sidi Fran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cisco and I were attacked. He was car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried away and I was left here bound. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be grateful if you will release me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I heard a grunt of surprise, a fumbling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then a match sputtered, illuminating</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face and figure of a black bearded na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive, who was looking curiously at me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, gazing about the room, his eyes fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon one of the candle lanterns we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left.

"These</seg><seg type="columnLine">ropes are growing very painful. Will you</seg><seg type="columnLine">not cut them?"

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that my fabri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation had been fortun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate. And my relief may</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been imagined</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he reached within</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cloak, pulled a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">curved knife from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheath, and bending over, cut the ropes</seg><seg type="columnLine">which held me. I sat up, chafing my</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrists and arms, and made the surprising</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery that my automatic was still in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">holster beneath my arm. Slowly I got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my feet, unsteadily, and I was thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast. The lies I had told this man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">set me at ^liberty. I had in mind to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">other lies which might set at liberty Bran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don Grey. The tap-tap-tap which I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard I had finally identified as that of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammer upon metal, and not far away. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspected that the brass worker was work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing during the night as well as during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day to get some job finished on time, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I now had it in mind to get from him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">file I needed and to inveigle this native into</seg><seg type="columnLine">helping me get Brandon Grey out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torture chamber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Earlier in the day I would have needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">no help, but now I knew that he would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">so weakened from emersion in the water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say nothing of the effect upon his nerves</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the continual dripping, that I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">need help to get him up to the hole in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall on one side and down from it on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. And with this in mind I spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">again to my unknown rescuer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think, Sidi," I told him, "that I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they have taken Senor Francisco,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if you will accompany me perhaps we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">can recover him. Will you do so?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not?" he said. "I desire to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Therefore let us go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," I said, "I have one matter to at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tend to first. Wait here for me for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment." 1 left the house and hurried to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the place whence came the tapping</seg><seg type="columnLine">noises. There, sure enough, although the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door of his shop was closed, I found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brass-smith working. He opened the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my request and was very glad to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">change an old file for a Spanish peseta</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece. In a moment I was back in Fran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cisco's house and found the native stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as I had left him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, Sidi," I said then, picking up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bundle of rods and the hook I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made, "now we will go to see if we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">find our friend, Francisco." At my re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quest he lighted another lantern. Imper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbably he watched me go through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuttered window into the passageway of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city wall, and silently he followed me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In due course we came to the transverse</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, beyond which I had left Brandon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey. Swiftly, while the Moor watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">with expressionless face, I jointed and tied</seg><seg type="columnLine">together the cleaning rods until I had a pole</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficiently long. On the end I fastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hook I had fashioned from the lantern</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle. When this was completed I</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised the pole carefully, got the hook up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the hole in the wall and over the piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rope I knew to be there, and pulled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rope ladder I had visioned came un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hniph!" grunted the native. "Is it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">there you expect to find Sidi Francisco?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," I lied, "I think he is here." I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave no time for further embarrassing</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions, but called to him to follow me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hooking a lantern over my arm I as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cended the ladder, reached the hole in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall and crawled in. My lantern showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that the ladder was hooked over a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron pin set into the stonework and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised and pleased indeed that it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not slipped off of this short pin when I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled it down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you coming?" I shouted down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Moor, then peering over I saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">put his hands upon the ladder. Without</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for him I slid through the hole and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat down, my legs hanging over the edge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As soon as the Moor came up we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull up the ladder and use it to descend on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inside of the wall. In the meantime I</seg><seg type="columnLine">called to Grey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you all right, old man?" I asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If you are, say yes--but don't talk."</seg><seg type="columnLine">24</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Righto," came back from him, but in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained, weak tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Moor should have been up by now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I turned to see what was the matter with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ladder was no longer hanging over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the book. 1 leaned forward quickly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">peered over, thinking that j&gt;erhai&gt;s it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come unfastened, while the Moor was as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cending.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now by the light of the lantern sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his feet I saw the Moor holding the lad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der in his hands, saw him throw it into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner and then look up at me with a grin</seg><seg type="columnLine">which seemed horrible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why don't you come up?"

I set Brandon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey, more dead than</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive, at liberty at last.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At liberty, that is so</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as the deadly tub</seg><seg type="columnLine">w a s concerned. A t</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberty I might say, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoy captivity with me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I felt cheered thereby--mightily</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheered. Together we could face what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to come. Two heads had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">better than one when I had unknowingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Belabbas to aid me; but I felt sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that now they would be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I must admit that I felt cheap indeed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the way Belabbas had tricked me. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that I had tricked him first into re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leasing me from my bonds, when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed what I had said and had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">known me, did not entirely offset, in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, the chagrin arising from the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had fooled me when at last he did learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I was up to. He had not known me;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I had not known him--but he had been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first to learn. There was one thing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least for which Brandon Grey and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be thankful. Belabbas apparently had</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten, in his undoubted surprise when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had led him to the hole in the wall, my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">short absence from the house when 1 went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the shop of the brass worker. As a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequence of this oversight, I had retained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the file which I had procured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Besides this, we had a light now, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantern contained a fairly large candle</seg><seg type="columnLine">which by careful usage would last a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderable time, or which, if we extinguished</seg><seg type="columnLine">it now and then to conserve it, could be re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted with the matches which I had se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cured from the Senorita Valdez.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brandon Grey was in sorry plight, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I worked feverishly to cut the chains which</seg><seg type="columnLine">held him, not because of the height of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, which was but little above his mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle, but because of his physical condition</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the result of being unable to move and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the icy cold water which had numbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and paralyzed him. But he was a strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with a reserve of strength which came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his rescue as soon as I had dragged him</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the tub, partially stripped him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">given him a brisk rubbing. In a quarter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an hour, perhaps, he was able to walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the chamber and something of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">look of a live man had returned to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he picked up the lantern and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make a careful examination of the dun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geon wherein we were.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The examination served to cheer us lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle. Two w-alls of the room were solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone, as was the floor and apparently the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling. A third side was solid save for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hole through which we had entered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fourth side bore the outline of a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway which had been filled in with cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones cemented together. Seemingly it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as solid as the rest of the wall. Bran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don Grey summed up the situation in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cut a hole through this old doorway</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the file," he said,, "or tear up our</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing and so make a rope which we may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to cast over the iron peg in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole. To cut through the wall means days</seg><seg type="columnLine">of work; to toss a rope into that hole so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it will catch on the peg means incon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceivable luck. Which shall we attempt?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Belabbas," I pointed out, "will prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably be returning with his friends before</seg><seg type="columnLine">long. He knows we have clothing, prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably guesses that we would try to make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope from it. Of course it is practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible to get the rope fastened in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole: even an expert with a lariat, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best sort of a rope, would find difficulty in</seg><seg type="columnLine">casting a noose over a peg set within a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tvvo-foot-square hole a dozen feet above</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head, having to make the cast at an an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gle of perhaps sixty degrees."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grey nodded his head in agreement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARBARY BLOOD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the sealed up doorway, shook his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head again doubtfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "We don't know how thick that wall is,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he pointed out, ''and we have only the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">tool, the file. And, as you say, Belabbas</seg><seg type="columnLine">will probably be returning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here I suddenly bethought myself of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the automatic pistol in the holster under</seg><seg type="columnLine">my arm. I drew it forth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This." I offered, "will hold Belabbas</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his friends for a while, I think. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">will have to come through the hole one</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I don't think they will try to enter,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Grey. "More probably they will just</seg><seg type="columnLine">put a man on guard outside so that if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">should manage to get a rope fastened it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not do us any good. His idea, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine, would be just to leave us here--</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "In that case," I said, "and I agree with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, it's up to us to begin cutting through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We selected a stone big enough, were it</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed, to permit the passage of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies, but low enough down to make our</seg><seg type="columnLine">labors at it most efficient, a stone waist</seg><seg type="columnLine">high. A few jabs of the pointed end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the file, which fortunately for us was large</seg><seg type="columnLine">and heavy, revealed that the mortar in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the stone had been set was nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inch thick. This fact was in our favor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as age and dampness had softened it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its thickness gave us room in which to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work the file. Had the stone been set in</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the usual quarter-inch of cement our</seg><seg type="columnLine">task would have been almost, or entirely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible. But the walling up of the gate</seg><seg type="columnLine">had apparently been done in haste, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">much mortar used, to save time of squar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing off the stones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once we had made a little impression</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the mortar, Grey extinguished the</seg><seg type="columnLine">candle in the lantern and we worked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness. This was unpleasant. Dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness has a way of illuminating the images</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one's mind, and the image which per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted in mine was of the picture in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone chamber some days later in case the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall we were attacking was as thick as</seg><seg type="columnLine">that through which we had passed. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of the apparent haste in its con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction we had a right, I felt, to hope that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was but one layer of stone. In that</seg><seg type="columnLine">case we could break through it; but when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we removed the stone on which we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">working, would there be other thicknesses</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which we would have no time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrate? And suddenly I felt a sicken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sensation as the thought came to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that even if we did penetrate this wall,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">what would we find on the other side?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps--probably, in fact--a dungeon</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar to this one. But I kept this cheer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less thought to myself, and in fact we</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked not at all as we worked. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brandon Grey's hands grew numb from</seg><seg type="columnLine">prodding with the file I relieved him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus we continued through the hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What is there to say concerning these</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours ?^ What does a man think as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">chips bits of mortar hour after hour with</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure death at his back and only possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberty ahead? It is true I thought now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then of Belabbas, of Mulai Moham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">med, of the Spaniard and of the Senorita</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valdez. But to tell the truth, they occu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pied a surprisingly small amount of my at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention. No, in such a situation, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the efforts are being exerted and continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a monotonous rate of physical action,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mind rides its own horse. And mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">insisted upon ignoring the present situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and in carrying me back through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">years to re-picture a thousand and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">scenes of no importance whatsoever. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost laughed aloud when I found myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking of the stupendous bustle that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">grandmother used to wear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We could not judge the passage of time</seg><seg type="columnLine">--time for us had become only the length-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening crack between the stones. No light</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shown in the hole in the wall, no sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to indicate that Belabbas or any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his men had returned. Only the sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">grating of the file point against the mortar</seg><seg type="columnLine">and our loud breathing could be heard;</seg><seg type="columnLine">these and the infernal drip, drip of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the pipe above the tub. It might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been six hours we had worked, or it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been sixteen, but at last we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed all the mortar the file would reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">on two sides and the top of the big stone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then we thrust our fingers into the crevice</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had created and strove to break the rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the mortar beneath it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It did not move. Despite our efforts it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was solid as it had been before all our la-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bor. Nothing remained save to continue</seg><seg type="columnLine">our work upon the mortar which lay be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> More hours passed and at length Grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid down the file. I relighted the lantern</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we again seized the stone, pressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward upon it with all our weight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This time it toppled forward a little. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">now we fell to working it from side to</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, pulling it forward. It came, a hair's-</seg><seg type="columnLine">breadth at a time it seemed, but it came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And at last it projected so far from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall that we got our shoulders under it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted it and threw it clear. Thereafter</seg><seg type="columnLine">2 6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for some moments we stood there, both of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, staring in the hole. I was waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey to lift the lantern and reveal our</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate. I suspect that he was waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me likewise. Suddenly he raised the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thrust it into the hole we had made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At die far end of the hole was a smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of rock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Or was it rock? Moving the lantern</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer I thrust the file against the seeming</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock and cried out in relief. The file pene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated it; it was only a coating of stucco</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had loosened from the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone we had removed. A half dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">pokes from the file and it fell away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through this hole I crawled, took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantern from Grey and watched him wrig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gle through.

Long narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">--boxes were stacked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the room and a glance suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficed to show that they contained guns. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantern squatted upon one pile of boxes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and several others hung from wires which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been fixed to the ceiling. This room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some reason, was perfectly dry, dusty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brandon Grey expressed my thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he said, "The Spaniard's storehouse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Mulai Mohammed's armory?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But together with this question there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come into my mind another. Regard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less of whose guns these were, it was mani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">festly necessary that there should be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">method of ingress and egress to this arse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nal. The house wherein I had found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Senorita Valdez connected with the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall; it seemed almost certain that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber in the city wall wherein we now</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood served as a back room for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">house which abutted the city barrier.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whether this arsenal belonged to the Span-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iard, Francisco, or to Belabbas, or to Mu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lai Mohammed--and so far as we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned they were all the same--it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain that from it was an exit which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would lead us into someone's domicile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whose would it be?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let us," said Grey, "first find the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of this place. I cannot see any door."</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gave a quick scrutiny to the walls. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was true, there seemed to be no doorway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was strange, strange enough to set us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">both upon a careful inspection of the walls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">particularly of that which we knew divided</seg><seg type="columnLine">this room from the house to which it must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be attached. But beyond any question</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatsoever, that wall was solid stone. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">being definitely established, we turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other walls. But as I have said, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were almost covered with racks holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifles. Of course a rifle rack may be so</seg><seg type="columnLine">built against a door that it will swing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. But our most careful efforts failed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">locate any such portal. A space in the ,</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the wall through which we had j</seg><seg type="columnLine">burrowed contained no racks, but to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, of course, there was no need of giv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brandon Grey and I looked at each other |</seg><seg type="columnLine">with some astonishment and a little amaze- I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. I began to make a remark when a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound came to my ears, and I stopped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey heard it, too, stepped quickly over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the hole we had cut and poked his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">into it. I joined him. Voices came to us, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat faintly, but still clearly enough I</seg><seg type="columnLine">so the words might be distinguished: talk !</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Arabic concerning what very shortly j</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going to happen to the twro masquerad- |</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing askoris in the torture chamber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Belabbas and his friends," Brandon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey backed up a little and whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was obvious. They were return-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to make sure that Brandon Grey and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">were eliminated from opposition to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">plot. Sounds were perceptible, scrapings</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the floor of the passageway and</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall, which indicated that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brought a wooden ladder. Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly they would have the rope ladder</seg><seg type="columnLine">in place inside the chamber and would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">descending. It was scarcely probable, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, that the light would be strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to reveal the absence of Grey from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tub or the absence of both of us from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chamber until they had reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. But then it would require but an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant for them to perceive that the tub</seg><seg type="columnLine">was empty, to find the hole in the wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That they would be fully armed was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainty. This thought reminded me of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own defense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had my automatic, but Brandon Grey's,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew, had been taken from him. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, I chuckled inwardly at the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we had several hundred stands of guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">at our backs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We had better get some rifles ready,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I said to Grey, "because it looks to me as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though there was going to be a fight. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">how shall we manage it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would have been a simple thing, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, for us with the rifles to have pot*</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARBARY BLOOD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ted Belabbas -and his friends as they de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scended the ladder or after they were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room, with but little chance of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">injuring us in return. I was capable of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thought, but incapable of the execu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of it. It would be rotten sportsman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, and I knew Brandon Grey would feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same way. The suggestion which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made was more acceptable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Once they are down into the room we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can hold them there with a rifle, one of us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the other tries to find a way out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this confounded armory. There must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a way." He reached over and took a rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one of the racks. "Did you see any</seg><seg type="columnLine">ammunition ?" he whispered to me sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had not, but I set about looking for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. At first I had expected easily to la}'</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand upon cartridges. Then I began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">search in earnest, and finally faced the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that so far as I could see there was no am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munition in the place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '"Anyhow, they won't know it," Grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned. "And here they come." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">poked a rifle through the hole, let it rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the stone. "Now," he said, "go</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead and see if you can find an exit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I started upon the renewed search.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stay where you are!'' Brandon Grey's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice snapped out abruptly in Arabic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw him smiling sweetly over the sights</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his rifle. Putting my head alongside</seg><seg type="columnLine">his I saw through the hole the figure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Belabbas and two other natives huddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the corner at the foot of the rope lad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, staring with wide eyes and surprised</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouths at the orifice from which the voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sounded, and through which a gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly it occurred to me that if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could but find the exit an excellent piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of strategy might be executed. I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">gain the street, return to the house of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Senorita Valdez, then re-enter the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, and returning to the hole through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the Moors had climbed, pull up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope ladder and take it away with me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving them to the same condition of cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tivity in which they thought they had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. No doubt we could find some method</seg><seg type="columnLine">of barricading the hole we had cut through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall into the arsenal. But I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">find the confounded exit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quite unexpectedly, however, I learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it was. The rough, low pine table</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the middle of the floor was suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">tipped over, a square opening was revealed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and through this opening appeared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and shoulders of Francisco Valdez.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beneath him I saw, in that first startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance, the faces of two Moors. It must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">27</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have been that Valdez was as startled as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I. We stared at each other while one</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have counted five, perhaps. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached for my gun, and called a warning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Brandon Grey. Quick as I was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spaniard was quicker. His pistol spat</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame and I felt a numbing pain in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">right arm; saw that my hand dropped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol. I reached for it quickly with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hand, only to have it leap from beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">my fingers as a bullet from the Spaniard's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol struck it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OW confusion reigned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Spaniard leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the room; Bran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don Grey met him, us-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his rifle as a club.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Moors behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spaniard joined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fray. Brandon Grey's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle had knocked the Spaniard's pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his hand and it had fallen through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trap door in the floor. Quickly Valdez</seg><seg type="columnLine">replaced it with a knife. I managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">recover my own pistol only to find that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been rendered useless by Valdez's bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let. So in imitation of Grey I seized a rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and managed to lay out one of the attack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Moors. I now duelled with the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, rifle butt against knife, and out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of my eye saw Brandon Grey en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaged in a similar struggle with the cursing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valdez. It was a rather even match: so</seg><seg type="columnLine">long as we could wield the rifles it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult for our opponents to use their</seg><seg type="columnLine">knives; but there was one disadvantage I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not, and neither, I judged, did Bran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don Grey, dare to raise my rifle for a blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would knock out my opponent; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have given him an opportunity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get home with his knife. All I could do</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to keep thudding at him. using my rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as a billiard player uses a cue. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then I saw the head and shoulders of Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">labbas coming through the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Very shortly, I realized, we would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">five opponents against us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I shouted a warning to Grey the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moor whom I was opposing, having his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the trap door, sidestepped to avoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">faling into it as I pressed him back. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprisingly, a thing happened which</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed the situation. I saw the figure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Spanish girl rise swiftly from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trap door, saw her hand and arm flick for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, saw the glitter of a long knife--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my opponent, screeching from a horrid</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut in his leg, jumped forward, stumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fell. When I looked again the Span-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish girl had disappeared. As quickly as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">28</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could do so I jumped to my fallen foe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a swing of my rifle gave him a tap</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his head which laid him out. I hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had not killed him, but spent little</seg><seg type="columnLine">time considering the matter. The Span-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iard, whom Brandon Grey was holding off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had little chance now, between the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns. He saw me coming, used the fatal</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment to glance at the silent form of liis</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally, and then fell beneath a blow from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grev.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Belabbas, seeing how things were going,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled himself back into the hole, even as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed at him. Thereupon 1 seized Grey's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm and pulled him to the trap door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we leaped in. I had remembered seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bolt on the other side of the door, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now swinging it down I slid the bolt into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bolt hole. We found ourselves in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">low passageway at the far end of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an oblong of light, and silhouetted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this oblong was a girl's figure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We wasted no time there. I had noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was a ring on the upper side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trap door, although the table had at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first concealed it, and in fact had scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolted it before I heard fingers fumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">at it. Nor was the door very solid--I sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected that if Belabbas and his friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to slide a rifle barrel through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring and two or three of them pull upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it they would tear the door loose from</seg><seg type="columnLine">its fastenings. Hence it behooved us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get elsewhere in haste.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I explained this to Grey as we hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the passageway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then," said Grey, "we had better bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ricade the door ahead of us if we can. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">least we ought to be able to hold them for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a while." Passing through the low door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way we found ourselves in a room some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what similar to that room in the Span-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iard's house where I had lain prisoner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another room ahead of it, separated from</seg><seg type="columnLine">it by a big archway, contained windows</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I imagined opened onto the street.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I looked at the Spanish girl after we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed and bolted the door; found her</seg><seg type="columnLine">disheveled, clothes tom, and a rope still</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon one arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They brought me here and tied me up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">senor," she explained. "And I--I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you were also a captive. I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">help thinking about your poor friend in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. Therefore I made every effort to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape in order that I might aid you or aid</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Both perhaps. But it was only af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter Francisco and the Moors had gone into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passageway and after I heard sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fighting that I was able to free myself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We assured her that she had come to our;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">aid in the nick of time, but she brushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside the compliments we would have paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is nothing," she averred. "Noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to speak about. And now what shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">you do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We told her then of our plan for barri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cading the door. That was a good idea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she thought, and helped us carry chests of</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawers and other articles of furniture</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we piled against the door so that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have taken a great force indeed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">break it open. In fact I was satisfied</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there would be no exit for Belabbas</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his friends in this direction. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">that reminded me of my previous plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come," I said to the girl. "Come and</seg><seg type="columnLine">show me the house of your cousin, Fran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cisco."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grey understood my intention; the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not need to, although I explained it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her later. She led us quickly out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house which, as I suspected, opened onto</seg><seg type="columnLine">a street, and down the street a short dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance she paused before a door which she</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung open for us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again she found and lighted lanterns</seg><seg type="columnLine">for our use as I threw open the wooden</seg><seg type="columnLine">shutters of the window through which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had already passed more than once. Swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">we passed through the aperture, found ouf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves in the passageway of the city wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sped along it until we came to the wall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the torture chamber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There, sure enough, was a wooden lad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der standing under the hole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brandon Grey sprang ahead of me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted the ladder and thrust his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's here," he cried, looking down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, and began swiftly to haul up the rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladder which hung suspended inside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Then, grinning, he came down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us again and between us we bore back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Francisco's house the rope ladder and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooden one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed to me, and it seemed to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend, that we had neatly captured Belab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bas and his men, as well as the Spaniard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his native followers; that we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed places with them most satisfac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torily. I could not see, nor could Grey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had any more means of making</seg><seg type="columnLine">an escape than we had had. Perhaps not</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much, for luck had been with us in</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving us only a thin wall to penetrate into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arsenal. Most anywhere else now, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have been confronted by thicknesses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wall which would require weeks to dig</seg><seg type="columnLine">through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, it seemed as though we had elim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARBARY BLOOD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">29</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">inated from the equation the two men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had thus far given us the most trouble,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that the path was dear now, for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while at least, to seek our real game--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">who called himsdf Mulai Mohammed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed to be the rightful Sultan of Mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">occo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Chapter IX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I FIND A SENTINEL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HERE was one thing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be done at once, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, and the senorita</seg><seg type="columnLine">reminded us of it. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to get her safely</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of Arzila, to get her</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet set, with those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">would protect her, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way to Tangier. What would happen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her if her cousin Francisco were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make his escape did not make pleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking. I knew that if he did not know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would at least suspect, and with a Span-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iard, suspicion is usually as compelling a</seg><seg type="columnLine">force as certainty. We must make use of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time while Francisco was a captive to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the girl to safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This at first seemed to be a simple mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, but on further consideration certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangers became perceptible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We do not know," Brandon Grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed out, "the extent of this plot in Ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zila, nor the number of men who may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">involved. I think it would be extremely</seg><seg type="columnLine">hazardous to attempt to send the senorita</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Tangier at the present moment. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite true thac wrapped in a native haik</seg><seg type="columnLine">she might pass through the streets any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where without being recognized--but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">differs from making a fifty-mile journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">in company with men whose curiosity</seg><seg type="columnLine">would naturally be somewhat aroused.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Idrees and some of his men are in town,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I could send them with the senorita,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I fancy that in the near future we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to have use for them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," I objected, "after what the Sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">orita Valdez has done for us we cannot let</seg><seg type="columnLine">her remain here in danger."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quite true," agreed Grey. "But there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is an alternative. We can let her remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">here if she is not in danger. What I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">in mind is this: there is a house on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other side of town--where Idrees is at</seg><seg type="columnLine">present I suppose--which as you know, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my service. If the senorita has no ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jections she could remain there until we</seg><seg type="columnLine">get our business cleaned up and then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could proceed with us to Tangier. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be in no danger in the house I speak</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of, because I will see to it that it is al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways guarded. But I am very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid of setting her feet upon the road to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tangier in company with anyone whom I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will do as the senor suggests," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl. "I am sure he will let no harm</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In that case, we had better travel," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey. "I want to get into some different</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes; both you and I, Dale, had better</seg><seg type="columnLine">change our appearance merely as a matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of precaution. Now if the senorita will</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow us, taking care to hold her haik up</seg><seg type="columnLine">i.n front of her face, the distance is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We set off across the town, and, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the south gate came into view, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned off the main road into a by-street</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at Grey's summons were admitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the courtyard of a dwelling house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brandon Grey held a rapid conversation</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Idrees, who had opened the door for</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, arranging that the Spanish girl be taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">in charge by old Fat'ma, the cook. Idrees</seg><seg type="columnLine">led the girl away and Grey led into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house where came shortly Idrees bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms full of native clothing for our use.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stain we had put on our faces was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly removed by a preparation which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey applied, and then after bathing we</seg><seg type="columnLine">donned the apparel of the town Moor--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the baggy trousers, fine white linen shirt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored broadcloth vest, and over this the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightweight white sulham and heavyweight</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored one. Fez and turban, white wool</seg><seg type="columnLine">stockings and yellow slippers completed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outfit--except for the shoulder bag whidi</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the place of pockets, and the auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matics which were concealed by our robes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scarcely was this change effected when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fat'ma came bringing an immense tray</seg><seg type="columnLine">laden with food, which we ate with gusto.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had been a long time since we had eaten,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in the excitement we had noticed no</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunger pains. Then a couple of whiskey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">and-sodas and cigarettes while we lay at</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease on floor cushions and discussed plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the immediate future.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The house of the fifth door from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tangier gate," said Grey, "was, I believe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied by Mulai Mohammed as head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters. Now, either he wTill go back</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, which is doubtful; or he will find</seg><seg type="columnLine">another house, which is probable. I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not think that he knows, or will be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess, what has become of Belabbas; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">unquestionably Belabbas would have told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him of having imprisoned me in the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the tub. That is why I think he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not return to the place where he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">30</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  before. The problem, then, is for us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">locate him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ''Don't you think," I asked, "that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably in the house of the fifth door</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we entered and that he made his es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cape with the others into the city wall?</seg><seg type="columnLine">If he did, where did he go?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That is still another question," agreed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey. "Maybe he was there--maybe he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't. If he was, he went where Belab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bas and the others went after they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">chained me up. Which, of course, means</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there is an exit from the city wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we have not yet found."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Wouldn't it," I suggested, "be a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea for us to go back to the house of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifth door, remove the barricade, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">search for the exit which they must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">known of?" Grey shook his head doubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully. /</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I don't like that city wall stuff," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There are more passages than you would</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine. It is a mighty easy thing to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost in the wall. We have had a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of narrow squeaks, and I'm not looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">for any more of them unless it's neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary. There is one fact which I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe has occurred to you. It's this: we</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the fifth house from the city gate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The gate was on our left. We turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right. Now it is obvious that al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the passageway on the left led up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the gate, it did not pass it. It must</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to an end there. Consequently</seg><seg type="columnLine">either Mulai Mohammed and Belabbas</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to one of the four houses between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city gate and the fifth door, or there</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be a passageway which we did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">see. which leads in the other direction, past</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room where I was a prisoner, past the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arsenal, and the good Lord only knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">how much farther. If they have also one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the four houses next the city gate it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be difficult to find it out; but if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have not, then there is the entire four or</seg><seg type="columnLine">five miles of city wall to explore--an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible feat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What is your suggestion?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "First," Grey replied, "to ascertain who</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupies the four houses between the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate and the fifth door. If they are not</seg><seg type="columnLine">open to suspicion--well, then I have a plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we won't discuss at present. Par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticularly as I haven't got it worked out</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite to my own satisfaction. The first</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to do is to find out about the four</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the people we passed, as we made</seg><seg type="columnLine">our way through the town, we appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be two town Moors. I knew that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore our clothing properly, that our heel-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">le.ss slippers betrayed no awkwardness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One must learn to curl one's toes at pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cisely the right moment in the step. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">skins were now as white as those of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">average native merchant, our beards were</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sufficient growth to serve the conven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, and we conversed with each other in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arabic as we walked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We shall po6e," Brandon Grey ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained, "as two merchants from Tangier,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who desire to open a carpet shop in Arzila,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and who desire to rent a house in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">to live. We desire, moreover, a house</seg><seg type="columnLine">as near as possible to the Tangier gate, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause the mosque of Mulai Idrees is near</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, and because the nearer we live to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mosque the greater grace shall we ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quire in the eyes of Saint Idrees. Hence</seg><seg type="columnLine">there will be nothing strange in our in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiring about the four houses in which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are particularly interested."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But who," I wondered aloud, "can tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">us about these houses? Isn't there an</seg><seg type="columnLine">cimin mustafed, or some real estate official,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who is in charge of the tax rolls?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's the man we are going to see,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Grey. "He used to have a little office</seg><seg type="columnLine">not far from the mosque, not far from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tangier gate, and I believe he still is</seg><seg type="columnLine">there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">E FOUND the official,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fat. lazy Moor with</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy lidded eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pudgy hands, squatting</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cubicle which</seg><seg type="columnLine">served him as an office,</seg><seg type="columnLine">checking over tax lists.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To him we made proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeting and Grey explained our desires.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As you know. Sidi." he added when</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was done, "on this side of the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are only shops, so that the only resi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dences are on the other side. It is one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those that we should like to obtain if it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The arnin mustafed leaned over ponder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously, cast his eye down the street toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the houses we had indicated, although he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have known them as well as he knew'</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own hand. He leaned back again shak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his head slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The fifth house you could have rented</seg><seg type="columnLine">a month ago," he said.

The other four--</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is no chance." His fat hand lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bulky roll of paper heavy as parchment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unrolled it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The first house is the property of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARBARY BLOOD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">excellency, Hadj Salem Terhouni," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">droned, "the second house belongs to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">merchant, Sidi Bushta, the third house is</seg><seg type="columnLine">owned by his Excellency, the basha, and is</seg><seg type="columnLine">leased for a term of years to Musa Zauda.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fourth house was sold during the cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent year to. and is occupied by, the grain</seg><seg type="columnLine">merchant, Suliman, of Fez.*'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are all of them known to you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sidi?" questioned Grey. The official</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at him quickly. "So, I mean, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know they would not be willing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent?'' Grey hastened to add.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All are known to me," pronounced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">amin mustafed heavily. "They would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">consider rental."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In that case. Sidi, we beg to thank you</seg><seg type="columnLine">for your information. We shall look</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. Perhaps you will permit us to call</seg><seg type="columnLine">again upon you tomorrow. In the mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time you might recall some other house</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would be suitable for us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You may call, of course," said the arnin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we bade him adieu. I realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey had brought the inquiry to an end</seg><seg type="columnLine">very cleverly by failing to pass a few coins</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the arnin to purchase his continued in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest in a house for us. But we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found out what we wanted to know. Ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept for the very slight chance that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">amin was a follower of Mulai Mohammed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a colleague of Belabbas, and therefore had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lied to us about the occupancy of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses in question--a contingency which</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed extremely remote--we could rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured that Mulai Mohammed was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">utilizing any of these houses as his head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thus," observed Grey, "we can forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. It now remains to perfect and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry out my other plan. Let's go some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where and think it over."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We returned to the house we had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">not long before, to Brandon Grey's Ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zilan domicile. The sun had set and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was already beginning to grow dark. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">we entered the house the fragrant smell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">steaming kcsk'soo came to me and shortly</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterward, with the Senorita Valdez as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">guest, we were disposing of an excellent</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal prepared by the ancient Fat'ma. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk did not hang upon the momentous</seg><seg type="columnLine">events through which we had recently</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed; Grey appeared not to want to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuss them, and neither did I. Once or</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice the senorita asked questions, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brandon Grey cleverly led her thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">into other channels. She withdrew as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as the meal was finished, and then my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend took up the business in hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am going to leave you for a while,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">31</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "I am going with Idrees to see a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cousin of his, who may know something</seg><seg type="columnLine">of value to us concerning Mulai Moham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">med. I would take you with me, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Idrees must go, and I do not think we</seg><seg type="columnLine">should leave the house unguarded so long</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the senorita is here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No one knows of her presence outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the household," I pointed out.

We think that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to this house unnoticed. But we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't take a chance. Besides, how do we</seg><seg type="columnLine">know how long the city wall is going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold Francisco and Belabbas and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't think there is any probability</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them escaping, do you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he agreed, "I don't think they will</seg><seg type="columnLine">get out until we let them out.

I sha'n't be long, barring</seg><seg type="columnLine">accidents."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About how long?" I asked, dissatisfied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling that I should be with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An hour, I should say," he answered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But don't start worrying for two hours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then don't worry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was easy for him to say; neverthe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less when he had gone I pictured, unneces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sarily perhaps, but vividly, Grey and Idrees</seg><seg type="columnLine">encountering Belabbas and his men, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Francisco, or both. Grey had explained,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my request, that he and Idrees were go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to a cousin's of the latter, who lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the south gate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How," I asked, prompted by misgiv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, "should I recognize the house if--if</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Idrees says," Grey told him, "that it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only house in Arzila which has a round</seg><seg type="columnLine">window in the front of it.

But the fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing hour, as it wan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, grew more a n d</seg><seg type="columnLine">more disturbing.

I knew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morocco well enough to be aware that a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> man, a foreigner, attending"to his own open</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and aboveboard business could come and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> go where he would, day or night, without</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> mishap; but I was also vividly aware of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the fact that a man cannot mix himself in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> plots or intrigue without drawing danger</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> as a magnet draws steel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I knew the Moor and I knew the Span-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> iard.

In fact, he sus-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> pected that the basha himself was support-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ing Mulai Mohammed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The last minutes of the second hour</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> dragged themselves away on heavy feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My friend had given permission for me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to worry when this time had elapsed, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> worry I did. And at last, after half of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the third hour had passed, I flung my sid-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ham over my shoulders, drew the hood of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> it over my head and went into the court-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> yard, thinking that perhaps the night air</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> would calm my nerves. The courtyard</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> adjoined the house and was surrounded by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 a wall seven or eight feet high. Along one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> side of this wall ran a back street. There</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were flowers and bushes and a few small</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees in the courtyard, which was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of a garden than court, as the gate</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the wall had been boarded up. I slip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered around for a few minutes in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness, then out of curiosity climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a big packing case which I noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying by the wall, and looked over into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street beyond. As I did so I saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark figure move back against the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This gave me something to think about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had made some noise in mounting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">box, and no doubt the watcher had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. That the man was watching the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had no doubt; watching or reconnoiter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. I hesitated for a moment as to what</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do; then drawing my pistol I climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall, dropped to the road and ran to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the spot where I had seen tlie shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappear. He ran before I could reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, paid no attention to my command to</seg><seg type="columnLine">halt, ran only the more swiftly when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired at him. He came to a side street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">veered into it and disappeared into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I climbed back over the wall with a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal of effort and re-entered the house. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was determined now to go in search of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey. At first, after seeing the nun</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom I had tried to kill, I had felt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey was right, that the house should not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be left unprotected, but now, I reflected,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place would not be molested; anyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had intended to try to enter or to at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack would have been warned that the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">was well guarded. I sought old Fat'ma</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the kitchen. She had heard the shot but</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not disturbed by it. The noise of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunfire was common because of the pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence of a garrison of native troops. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was also surprised to see, squatting in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner an old whiskered man smoking</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long stemmed keef pipe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am going out," I told her, "and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not to open the door to anyone except</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you hear the voice of Sidi Grey or</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself. Moreover--" I looked at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man--"can your man here handle a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is my brother," she said. "Get</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, you lazy fool, and listen to the gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man grunted, laid aside his pipe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can you handle a gun?" I asked him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course, Sidi, of course. Was I</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a soldier for many years?" His pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent appearance was no affirmative proof</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this; still I went into the other room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">secured a rifle and gave it to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARBARY BLOOD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You two will guard the Spanish sefior-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ita while I am gone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is no need for a gun, Sidi," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old man. "No one will disturb us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nevertheless--" he set the gun in a cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner--"nevertheless, if anyone does, as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suredly I shall slay him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus it came about that three hours af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter Brandon Grey had left me I was shuf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fling through the dark streets of Arzila</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the south gate in search of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house with the circular window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Chapter X</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SULTAN'S SEAL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE African stars il-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminated things faint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, so that I was able</seg><seg type="columnLine">without difficulty to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make my way across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tow'n, and upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing near to the Fez</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate discernible for</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite a distance because of the lanterns of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night guards stationed there, I was able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to locate the house of Idrees' cousin, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwelling with the circular window, so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">called, near the rcof. It appeared as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">disc of blackness against the white wall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house. Beneath it was a door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon this door I lost no time in knocking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There w'as no answer to my summons and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hammered again, more loudly. Still no</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer, and there was that peculiar seem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly audible silence which pertains to</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses empty of humans. Nevertheless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a due interval, I rapped again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">no answer being forthcoming to the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">summons, I turned away and was debating</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'hat to do, when three figures which I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not seen before approached the house. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be caught unaware, I half drew my pis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tol from the holster beneath my shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and waited. Probably the trio were only</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing along the street, but I wras not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be caught off guard. I was glad of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">precaution, when one of them stepped to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Schoon h'naya?" Who is here? he</seg><seg type="columnLine">queried. I was about to reply that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought a certain man named somebody or</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, when another voice spoke, that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brandon Grey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am glad you're here," he said. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going back to the house now to reas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure you.

And after we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted cigarettes, I looked at Grey and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gleam of adventurous reminiscence in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eye. "Well, shoot," I said. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">have you been up to ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, nothing much. Only--I have seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mulai Mohammed and become one of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">followers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have what? Are you joking?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he affirmed. "It's the truth. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, when Idrees and I got here to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house of his cousin, his cousin told about</seg><seg type="columnLine">having noticed quite a number of strangers</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming and going from a house just off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">market-place. Observant sort of chap, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to be. At any rate it struck him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer that these fellows were all stran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers. He claims to know everybody in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arzila and most of the country round</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. It looked to me as though this</seg><seg type="columnLine">were worth looking into and consequently</seg><seg type="columnLine">we took a walk up to the market-place, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three of us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There I left Idrees and his cousin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat myself down upon the matting of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffee house from where I could see those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who entered and left the place Idrees'</seg><seg type="columnLine">cousin had indicated. I figured that pretty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon some one of them would want some</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffee--you know the cafe here is like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">English pub or the American saloon--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I guessed right. I had not been sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">there long when a fellow came out, shuf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fled over to the cafe, squatted dowm and or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered coffee. I sized him up as a country</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moor, not very intelligent, and it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult to get into conversation with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No use going into that. You know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">you would go about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The upshot of it was that I convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that I was a kaid just arrived in Ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zila for the purpose of offering the support</seg><seg type="columnLine">of myself and the men of my village to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">noble Mulai Mohammed. The fool did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even question me, merely assured me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Mulai Mohammed was the rightful</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sultan, and that no doubt he would shortly</seg><seg type="columnLine">be on the throne. Then I had him, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">just for luck I tried out on him the charm</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the Black Magician gave us in Tan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gier--just showed it to him in the palm of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hand, very secretly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'Allah!' he exclaimed, 'Allah kenm!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is the mark of the true Sultan!' So</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were right in your guess, you see, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the birthmark which Mulai Mohammed</seg><seg type="columnLine">34</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sports is the shape, roughly, of a five-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingered hand. This made me solid with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and--oh yes, I paid for more coffee</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him--and then I became very friendly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I told him that although I had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">told where to find Mulai Mohammed, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone to the fifth house from the Tan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gier gate but no one was there. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, I suspected, had caused him to move</seg><seg type="columnLine">his headquarters. Yes, the fellow said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">something had happened, he did not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">just what. But he could now be found at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a house across the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">" 'I am going back there myself soon/ he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. 'You can go with me if you wish/</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Naturally I wished, so he led me across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street, gave a couple of raps thrice re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated upon the door.

I prostrated my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self and bumped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor with my forehead</seg><seg type="columnLine">and invited Allah to</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile upon this worthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">descendant of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prophet and our right-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful Sultan. Personally I think that Allah</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not only smiling but laughing as well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But to get on with the story. We appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently had entered in the middle of a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussion or a giving of orders, for now Mu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lai Mohammed continued the giving of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll cut it short: at four o'clock tomor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rom morning--yes, that's right, it isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">midnight yet--at four o'clock tomorrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning all of his followers are to gather</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the house and in the market-place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thence to launch an attack upon the garri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son.

They might, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that.

The idea was bizarre. But he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly in earnest, and very shortly we</seg><seg type="columnLine">set forth upon the first of our missions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The basha," he explained as we went</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, "left the meeting for some purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I did not discover.

His business, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was concerned with the arrangements for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intended seizure of the town in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning. He went to his own residence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that is where we are going."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The basha's house, I found when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached it, was not a very pretentious place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but enough so to serve as the abode of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">basha of a small town like Arzila. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a big and fancy doorway in the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the place, which I knew must enter into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the garden in which the house was set.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This gate was unlighted and, so far as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could determine, unguarded. The nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row street which approached it came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">an end at a broad cross street which ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">past the residence, and in this dark canyon</seg><seg type="columnLine">like passageway we waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't think," whispered Grey, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he has left his house yet to return to Mu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lai Mohammed, but we will catch him</seg><seg type="columnLine">either coming or going."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had not long to wait. The gate</seg><seg type="columnLine">creaked as it swung back and was drawn to</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. A portly figure hastened toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">us across the street. Apparently the basha</seg><seg type="columnLine">was keeping this business a secret; at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was not running around the town this</seg><seg type="columnLine">night with a bunch of guards. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been better for him if he had been.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As it was he walked into our arms, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he could do more than grunt in</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise, Brandon Grey had seized him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I had wrapped the hood of his sulham</seg><seg type="columnLine">around his face and neck, choking off any</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise. I heard a tinkle of metal, a click,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw that Grey had handcuffed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">basha's hands behind him. And now my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend addressed the man in no uncertain</seg><seg type="columnLine">terms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'That which you feel poking you in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribs, Sidi Traitor," he said, in Arabic, "is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pi3tol of large caliber which will make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">most unsightly hole. You desire to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">who I am, of course. I shall tell you.

I not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspect you ; I know you are guilty. Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">life is in my hands: you may buy it for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">price."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--I am no follower of Mulai Moham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">med," the man gasped the words, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosened the throttling cloth a little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You lie," Grey told him bluntly. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have just come from a meeting where I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw you at the feet of Mulai Mohammed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I heard you accept instructions from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">35</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Y'ou were returning to him now."</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt the big figure grow limp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What--what is your price, Sidi?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You do not wish to die then--for your</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sultan Mulai Mohammed?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Sidi," quavered the man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In that case," rasped Grey, "you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead us into your house, into your office,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where we will discuss the price of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">life.

I bolted it</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind us. The basha</seg><seg type="columnLine">led us through a dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden to a little side</seg><seg type="columnLine">door of the house. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered that and found ourselves in a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">room fitted up as an office in the native</seg><seg type="columnLine">style. The basha obeyed Grey's motion</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seated himself upon the cushions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Grey examined the doors and locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Pulled aside every hanging with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the walls were covered to make sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there were no hidden doors through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we might be surprised. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">no window's to bother us. Two huge can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dles in floor candlesticks lighted the room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there were half a dozen others standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">around and these Grey also lighted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At his suggestion I picked up a round</seg><seg type="columnLine">table perhaps a yard in diameter, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than eight inches high, on which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper, bamboo pens, ink and a dish of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand for blotting purposes, and set it down</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the basha's reach. While I wras do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing this Grey searched the Moor, relieving</seg><seg type="columnLine">him of the long curved knife called kum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iah, which almost every native carries; re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieving him also of a small caliber pistol.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he unlocked the handcuff from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">basha's left wrist, but snapped it around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man's left ankle. The position this</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused did not seem comfortable, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly well precluded any rash actions on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the part of the native official.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These things being attended to, Grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in front of the basha, staring down</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him coldly, and stated his desires.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you a khalifa?" he asked. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">khalifa is a vice-basha.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Sidi, I have not, at the moment,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied the Moor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Strange," commented Grey, "but I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose you were waiting to see who would</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay the largest amount for the job.

Then my friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">squatted cross-legged before the little ta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble, reflectively lighted a cigarette and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took several deep draughts of smoke, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to write.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I watched him wonderingly.

But Grey's hand moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly from right to left across the j)age</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in a surprisingly short time he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">written half a dozen lines. Then he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tangle of lines which I knew to be a sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature. although I could not read it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally he fished around in his bosom, drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a thin chain at the end of which dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled a metallic obect. This came apart in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands and I saw that it was a rubber</seg><seg type="columnLine">stamp. He impressed it above the signa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know--" he held out the paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the inspection of the baslia--"that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seal?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Moor's eyes bulged and he made an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinctive bow of reverence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That," he said, "is the seal of our Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Master.

"And this document upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I have just placed the seal, appoints</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the name of the sultan, a new basha of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arzila.

"Sidi Alarbi</seg><seg type="columnLine">ben Hassan," he said, extending me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper, "here is your commission as basha</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our city."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was amazed, too, at the native name he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had bestowed upon me, but at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I perceived that this thing was serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in order.

For a moment, I thought, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">basha hesitated. I saw a little motion be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the folds of the sulham which lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">across Grey's lap, and perhaps the basha</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw it also; because, drawing a deep breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">he handed the message to the captain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARBARY BLOOD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Carry this to the house where dwells</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sidna.

I n accordance</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his suggestion I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken up a position</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the cushions beside the basha--in</seg><seg type="columnLine">case of contingencies. I did not have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest idea, nor do I think that he did,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the basha would make any false</seg><seg type="columnLine">moves, but we did not intend to give him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We rose, of course, as the man called</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mulai Mohammed entered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dismiss the captain," I muttered to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">basha, and at a word from him the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the guards closed the door and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.

But I was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn that, surprised and angered as he un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtedly was, he had been doing some</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift thinking in that brief interval.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With admirable nerve he proceeded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn his back squarely to the gun in Grey's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and to stride, without a word, toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the basha.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Obviously this reaction puzzled Grey as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it did me, but the explanation came with</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning-like quickness: the half dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">paces across the room had given him time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">37</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to thrust his hand inside his sulham; now</seg><seg type="columnLine">he swung about and leaped upon Grey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was close behind him. It was a des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perately brave action. He could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, as I did, that Grey did not dare to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire because a shot would bring the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">household running. And if Grey had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to shoot, Mulai Mohammed would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have met quick death. As it was, I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey parry the upward stroke of the ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible curved kumiah with a downward</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweep of the pistol, I saw him toss his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun onto the cushion behind me, and as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">continuation of the same motion, seize the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrist which held the knife. I took two</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps forward to his assistance. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the action, shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can handle him," he said. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch the basha."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had known that Grey was strong, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see that the big native was no weak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling.

The art of boxing is al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most unknown to them, although they do</seg><seg type="columnLine">know something of jiu-jitsu, and I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Grey was an expert with the gloves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had scarcely time to think of this before</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw him release his hold upon the Moor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm, feint with his left, and as the Moor</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinctively guarded his masked face, gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">an uppercut to his jaw. The pretender to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Moorish throne dropped as though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been pole-axed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Allah kcrim!"

A close-cut and somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparse black stubble ran over cheeks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chin and upper lip. The lips were coarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">and heavy, drawn back now to show a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow teeth and above them a large nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">had negroid characteristics.

I thought, as I looked at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, for him to keep it masked. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother and father from whom he pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended to have sprung, Mulai el-Hassan</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his Sultana, were white.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grey turned from a study of the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look at the basha with a quizzical smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have seen this face before, Sidi."</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a statement rather than a question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The basha nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You, of course, did not believe that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the son of Mulai el-Hassan," con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued Grey. The face of the basha, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite his predicament, grinned faintly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was necessary that he should be,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know who he is--really?" ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned Grey.

Lacking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the use of his hands he bit at the exposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck like a beast of prey. We pulled him</seg><seg type="columnLine">away as soon as we had recovered our mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentary surprise.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that we did not consider his comfort</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much, but it seemed to me we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made sure that he would not get loose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This being done we chucked him into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner and withdrew into an alcove, out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">earshot of the others, for a consultation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the upshot of this conversation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a quarter of an hour later I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned the part I was to play, and had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the basha's residence to make various</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparations, and to ascertain if all was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it should be at Grey's house. Grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">elected to remain with his natives, assuring</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that he intended to snatch a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours' sleep and advised me to do the same.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But as I had to be on foot again an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the meeting scheduled for four</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock in the morning, I had little rime for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RMED with my docu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of appointment I</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought the small mili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary garrison and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">particularly, its captain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My authority was su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preme in Arzila, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Brandon Grey--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and except for that situation which modi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fies all authority, even the highest, namely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">willingness on the part of one's subjects</seg><seg type="columnLine">to obey or force enough to make them</seg><seg type="columnLine">obey.

Thus the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">was propitious for the arising of pretend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers and other disturbers of the nation's</seg><seg type="columnLine">iieaee, and disloyalty to His Majesty Abd-</seg><seg type="columnLine">el-Aziz was to be encountered in many</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters where change of Sultans might</seg><seg type="columnLine">react to the gain of the individual.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I knew from Brandon Grey that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were traitors among the little force of</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventy-five or a hundred soldiers in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arzila garrison. That some of them were</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to be looking with favor upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">claims of the pretender, Mulai Moham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">med. The former captain of this garri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son had been involved in this movement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey had told me, but either by accident</seg><seg type="columnLine">or intention, a rifle had gone off in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">vicinity with results fatal to him. Grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood the new captain to be one Kaid</seg><seg type="columnLine">xAttar, and had little confidence in his loy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alty. But loyal or disloyal the document I</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried should serve to bring the captain to</seg><seg type="columnLine">order--particularly as I had been author-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized by Grey to tender him, for his sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port in this matter, not only a better posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, but certain English banknotes which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I carried. Money talks a universal lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I came eventually to the garrison gate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was carelessly halted by a slovenly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleepy guard, who shook his head when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded admittance to the captain, stat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that the chief was asleep. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been useless to have made any ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planations as to my identity to this stupid</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow, but I knew of the astonishing fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have of documents with official seals;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with good reason, because there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">extremely few of them who can read, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">many who know by sad experience that</seg><seg type="columnLine">an officially sealed paper often carries</seg><seg type="columnLine">grief. Letters from high officials are</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore met with great reverence, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">many cases amounting to kowtowing, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">prostration as though the letter were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">person of the writer himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the light of the lantern hanging on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gate I showed the guard the document</seg><seg type="columnLine">I carried--pointed to the official seal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sultan, The fellow came out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleepiness most abruptly. And after pay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing due reverence to the symbol of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lord and master of the country, made haste</seg><seg type="columnLine">to unlock the gate and to lead me through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the garrison straight to the one individual</seg><seg type="columnLine">domicile, the house of the captain. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">another sleepy sentry halted us, staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupidly at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''This excellency," said the guard from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gate, "bears a letter from the Sidna,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mulai Abd-el-Aziz. Present arms and in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">form his excellency the captain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second guard came to life abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the first had done. Letters from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sultan are usually received in a city only</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the accompaniment of the thunder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-one guns from the local battery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But before the guard had applied his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knuckles to the portal of the captain's</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, the door swung open and a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood framed in the doorway, his face il-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumined by the lanterns hanging on either</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is this?" he demanded. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you say concerning a letter from His</seg><seg type="columnLine">Majesty?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guards looked at me and I looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain. I stepped forward quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hadj Wazzani!" I exclaimed, calling</seg><seg type="columnLine">him by name. "So you are captain of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">garrison! Let us enter your house then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I will explain the business." I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">relieved, for this was not the unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kaid Attar, but one whom I had met and</seg><seg type="columnLine">known fairly well in Tangier. A man I</seg><seg type="columnLine">liked and who I believed was loyal to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sultan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My words startled him. He leaned for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward to peer into my face, and I took ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage of this to whisper my name. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his face cleared, he drew me into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house and closed the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And so," he said, after I had explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation and my desires, "and so this</seg><seg type="columnLine">boil comes to a head shortly, eh? Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">high time! High time! I was planning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I may tell you, to have a few private exe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutions here in the garrison in the near</seg><seg type="columnLine">future. Yes, I have known that things</seg><seg type="columnLine">were stirring in Arzila, but I arrived only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few days since and one cannot be too</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasty in handling such a situation, espe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cially as the basha--'' he hesitated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Particularly as the basha was mixed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it," I completed for him. "Well, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">basha is out now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is well," he commented. "Never-</seg><seg type="columnLine">theless, the basha I believe was really</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced into his position. He is greatly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">debt, and his debtors were supporting Mu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lai Mohammed, notably one called Belab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bas."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," I said, "and Belabbas must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed where he can support no other pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenders."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hadj Wazzani agreed with me heartily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I did not tell him then of where I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved Belabbas to be at the moment, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">omission which I was later to regret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Time was passing swiftly and there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">other matters needing my attention.</seg><seg type="columnLine">40</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You can, then," I asked, "pick out two</seg><seg type="columnLine">score honest fellows of your garrison upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom you can depend? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Assuredly, my friend, assuredly," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "In fact practically all that I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done in the few days I have been at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">post is to discover what kind of an army</seg><seg type="columnLine">--" he laughed at the word--"I have."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And you are acquainted with the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who owns the coffee house across the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the place where the meeting is to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">held?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I know him well," the captain assured</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. "We come from the same town, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is loyal." I rose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Then at four o'clock you will have ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged to be concealed with your men in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coffee house awaiting the signal from</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. which will be two pistol shots."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It is already arranged, Sidi. Have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear on that score. There is a rear en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance to the coffee house on a back street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which I can send my men without</seg><seg type="columnLine">being seen, a few at a time. I will begin</seg><seg type="columnLine">the business at once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then I had the pleasure of using,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as reward, that which I had thought to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a weapon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I am authorized to tell you," I said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"in the name of His Majesty, that a better</seg><seg type="columnLine">post will be yours as the result of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">work tonight." But I did not mention the</seg><seg type="columnLine">banknotes I carried. Hadj Wazzani was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not that kind of a man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thereupon I went away from the garri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son and started for Brandon Grey's house</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I had left the senorita. The street</seg><seg type="columnLine">I followed passed very near the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">where we had barricaded the door against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the egress of Francisco and Belabbas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Time pressed, I knew; it had been two</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock when I had started for the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain's house. It must now be three or</seg><seg type="columnLine">later. Nevertheless the impulse seized me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take a look at the barricade. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that the impulse was silly, caused by</seg><seg type="columnLine">my curiosity and started on my way again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it would require only live minutes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impulse was there, so I turned, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traced my steps and covered the short dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance down a side street to where the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I was startled, when I reached it, to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the door was open. Startled and put</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my guard. I listened carefully, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">any sound which might indicate people</seg><seg type="columnLine">within, heard none, and struck a match,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no one in the room. I ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced into the passageway. The match</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned out and I struck another. Its yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low gleam showed me that the barricade</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had been removed, that the door into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city wall was ajar!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ERY quickly I made my</seg><seg type="columnLine">exit from that house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, outside, I drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">my pistol and held it</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready. Belabbas and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others might now be at</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberty, or, so far as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, the man who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved the barricade might just have fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished doing it and be still within the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. It occurred to me to re-enter the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house and replace the barricade, but I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reject the plan at once. I had not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time for this labor, which, after all would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be useless in case the escape had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">been made, as seemed probable. More-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over. I could not afford to risk being at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacked and overpowered by Belabbas or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Spaniard, or both, leaving Brandon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey unaided and the captain of the garri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son without anyone to give him the signal</seg><seg type="columnLine">as arranged. My first duty, it seemed, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to protect myself in order that Grey's plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be carried out. Therefore I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly away from that place of danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had not gone far, however, when I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">called the man whom I had seen watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house, at whom I had fired unsuccess-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully. Had that man been Belabbas or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Spaniard? As Grey had said, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not tell, in such a place as this, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">might know or suspect our actions. Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man I had tried to kill one of our en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">emies reconnoitering the house previous to</seg><seg type="columnLine">an attack in force? If Belabbas or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spaniard were at liberty, it was beyond me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to guess what they would do. We had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent Idrees and his cousin to guard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, it was true, but it was quite on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cards that Belabbas could take with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough force to overcome all the resis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance they could put up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was, therefore, with hurried and per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbed feet that I hastened toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house of Brandon Grey. As I swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">around a corner, pistol in hand, into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street running by the house, I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds. Sounds which speedily resolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves into the noise of combat. I ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached and saw figures struggling in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness. Then a pistol shot was fired</seg><seg type="columnLine">and another, and another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even though my principal duty might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Brandon Grey and his plans, I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">let Idrees and his cousin wage unequal</seg><seg type="columnLine">warfare against an undetermined number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men, who, I felt certain, included Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">labbas and the Spaniard. That they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARBARY BLOOD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting furiously was evident.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Idrees! Idrees!" I shouted as loudly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I could and plunged across the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the twisting shadows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Idrees!" I called again. I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot, not knowing friend from foe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here, Sidi," said a voice, as a crouch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing figure approached and rose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Call your cousin," I commanded, "to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come here to us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is wounded, lying beside the wall,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">panted Idrees. "There were five. One I</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, the coast being clear, I began</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting. A black figure plunged toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and I let him have it, bringing him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a heap at my feet. The others followed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Idrees swung a rifle as a club and I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">its impact upon a head. And then my</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic clicked, failed to fire, was ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausted of ammunition. I did not need it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, for now our tw^o opponents who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were able to do so, turned and lied into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I fished in my pocket for matches, failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find them and was about to ask Idrees</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some when I heard shouts from within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house, the door swung open and, lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tern in one hand, rifle in the other, Fat'ma's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient brother stood in the doorway wag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling his beard and demanding what in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name of Mulai Idrees people thought they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were doing, shooting in the streets and</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping honest folk awake. He baa-ed</seg><seg type="columnLine">there like a nanny goat until I took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantern from his hand and with Idrees</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to see what the light would show.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost at the gateway of the house lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">Idrees' cousin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is only a bullet through the shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, Sidi. Nothing serious," he greeted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">U5.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We lifted him to his feet, found that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could stand, and took him to the gate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the old man stood, and let him rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">there; then returned to see wliat of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foes had fallen. The first we came upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a native unknown to either Idrees or</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, a vicious looking fellow, and very</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At a little distance lay another. I low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the lantern and saw that it was Fran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cisco, the Spaniard, and a purple hole in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his forehead indicated that he would run</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more guns. I guess I hoped that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third man would be Belabbas. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">groaning and groaned worse when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned him over to see who he might be.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was not Belabbas, and at first I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not know who it was. Then remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brance came. This was the man, Sidi</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Achmed Lahya, who had sat across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table from me at Brandon Grey's home the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night I rode to El-Menar in the attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to capture Belabbas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now I saw, in a flash, why Grey later</seg><seg type="columnLine">had asked me what I thought of him; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw, too, how the Black Magician had ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired his eerie knowledge of our plans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apparently Brandon Grey, doubting this</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, had let fall in his hearing something</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would lead him eventually to reveal</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, and without any particular harm</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Grey's own plans. Even as I was think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing this, the fellow opened his eyes, stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you do, Sidi Dale," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with a convulsion, died.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We carried the bodies into the courtyard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and closed the door and then Idrees set</seg><seg type="columnLine">about attending to the injuries of his cou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sin. My thought now wfas to get word to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brandon Grey, to warn him that Belabbas</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at liberty. No telling what the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">might do--Grey, in going to Mulai Mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammed's house at four o'clock might walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a fatal trap. Was there yet time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to the basha's house and wrarn him? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at my watch, stared at it--it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible that so much time had passed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It now lacked only twenty minutes of four</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock. What the devil should I do? If</seg><seg type="columnLine">I went to the basha's house to warn Grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">I might not find him there. I probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not; already perhaps, he had gone to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meeting Mulai Mohammed had called,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps had walked into a trap set for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Belabbas. Or he might be on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. No, I resolved, my job was to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">to that meeting, in a hurry, to be there</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Grey arrived, if possible, so that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">case of danger I could summon the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his men from their hiding place across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But if Belabbas were already there he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would recognize me--and I had no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to what he would try to do in that case.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A disguise of some sort was necessary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with only a moment in which to make it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, I must do the best I could, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust to luck that the little alteration in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance would serve. Wherefore, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">borrowed a piece of Idrees' turban cloth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wrapped it around my neck and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower part of my face, as though I suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered from some ailment. Also, I dosed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it liberally with a strong smelling liniment</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found at hand.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping town would have awakened to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself possessed by a new regime. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been no struggle, because while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Moroccan natives, out of sheer love of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting, would have united to repel an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vading force, their sense of fatalism de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prived them of the desire and the energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to overthrow a usurper who had already es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tablished himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In other words, they would contend</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a thing not yet accomplished even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though that thing might be best for them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they would not oppose a change al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready executed, even though it might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad for them. There is merit in this view-</seg><seg type="columnLine">point: if the usurper maintains his posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion he has no cause for grudge against you</seg><seg type="columnLine">who did not oppose him; if he is ousted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one can always say that at least nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been done in active support of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen usurper.

Other pedes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trians passed me in silence, hastening, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed, t^ the same destination. And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">when at last I reached the place 1 found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big front room well filled and half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen or more natives standing about out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, discussing in low voices the matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hand. I paused outside to observe what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going on. The door of the house was</seg><seg type="columnLine">half open, and although the room was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only dimly lighted by a couple of lanterns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could see that the floor space was pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">well covered by squatting natives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mulai Mohammed has not yet arrived?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard the question put by a native who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had just come up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not yet," came the answer. "All is</seg><seg type="columnLine">in readiness, however; now we merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">await the coming of the Sidna. No doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">he w'ill come with Belabbas."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hmph!" I grunted to myself. Belab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bas might come, it was true, but nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">short of a miracle would permit the masked</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure of the pretender to appear in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded room. I thought of entering</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, to ascertain if Brandon Grey load yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived, and yet also I wanted to stroll</seg><seg type="columnLine">casually across the street to the coffee</seg><seg type="columnLine">house to make sure that the captain and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were there in readiness. I had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided to do the latter, had already taken a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few steps in that direction, when someone</seg><seg type="columnLine">called from the doorway for us all to en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I desired a station at the door, where-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore I permitted the others who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside to enter ahead of me. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded into the room, and lacking seating</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, took up positions along the walls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nowhere could I see the face or figure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friend. As I stepped across the thresh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">old a man with whose face I was unfa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miliar, entered from a little door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused just within it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Homage to our Sidna, Mulai Moham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">med!" he announced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly those who were seated rose to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their feet. Silence fell. I saw only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">backs of heads. The faces w^ere all toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open door behind the man who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the announcement. For a brief mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment I think I failed to comprehend what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been said. I must have stared stu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pidly at the door. I remember wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing what kind of a joke the fellow was</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing upon us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then into the room strode the</seg><seg type="columnLine">masked figure. There was a mutter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blessing from the throng and deep obei-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sance. I gasped. Consternation seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shook me. It was unbelievable, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">true, unless my eyes lied to me. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath or two I was panic stricken. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing untoward had happened. And fears</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARBARY BLOOD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">came tumbling upon me. If Mulai Mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammed had made his escape from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">basha's residence, where was Grey? He</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been overcome. The basha</seg><seg type="columnLine">might even now be approaching with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of followers. Was Grey alive, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">if so, where? Was he dead? Were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain of the garrison and his men really</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the coffee house ready to come to my as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistance at my signal? And when should</seg><seg type="columnLine">I give it? The word as to the time was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have been given me by Grey, the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand raised with first and second fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended. Should I take my chances now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">give the signal which would bring the sol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diers? Or-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had been so occupied in my problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had not heard the sound of hurriedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching footsteps. But now I real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized that two men pushed past me, That</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were breathing deeply as from run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning. I darted a glance at them, and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that one of them was Belabbas. Even as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I perceived this--realized the added dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger-- heard the voice of the masked man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All are here?" it questioned. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-nine chiefs have come?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All, Sidna, all are here," replied some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the followers," continued the</seg><seg type="columnLine">masked man. "They are gathered outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Fahssi gate as was arranged?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Sidna. Yes---yes." A dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is well," said Mulai Mohammed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It required only a moment for this to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take place; during that moment I stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the masked figure, my thoughts in tur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moil. The crisis had arrived. But Bran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don Grey had not. I must give the signal</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would summon the captain and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. I moved my hand stealthily under</seg><seg type="columnLine">my djcllaba• to grasp the pistol with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">to signal. The voice of the masked man</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The first thing to be done, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is to overpower the guard at the gate and</seg><seg type="columnLine">let your men enter. After that-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T THAT moment my</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncovered eye must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have popped for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">masked pretender, a s</seg><seg type="columnLine">he spoke, and apparent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly merely as a gesture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of emphasis, had raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right hand with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first and second fingers extended, the oth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers folded into the palm. There are some</seg><seg type="columnLine">things which the mind at first flatly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuses despite the senses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">43</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A coincidence!" something shouted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head. ''But impossible!" came another</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental shout. And then I saw that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">masked man, having lowered his right arm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but speaking still, had again raised it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fingers as before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I desire, Oh Sidna," boomed the voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Belabbas then, "to see again the sacred</seg><seg type="columnLine">birthmark upon your breast."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It is permitted for you to look again</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the mark." He bared his left breast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposing the hand shaped crimson symbol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A mutter of awe tittilated through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Art satisfied, Sidi Belabbas?" There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a lash in the question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Sidna. I--I meant not that."</seg><seg type="columnLine">stammered Belabbas. "Thou art indeed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the son of Mulai el-Hassan and our right-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful Lord and Master." He made obei-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then again the masked man's right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand rose with two fingers outstretched--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I am glad of that, Belabbas," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Glad indeed that you are satisfied."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With his left hand he tore away the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mask--my forefinger sent two shots crash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into the night--while I stared at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing face of Brandon Grey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the two shots from my pistol echoed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the deserted streets, I became</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of two activities. The coffee house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintly discernible now in the quickening</seg><seg type="columnLine">false dawn, began to spew forth running</seg><seg type="columnLine">men; within the room Brandon Grey had</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn a pistol and before the paralyzed</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd had sensed the turn of events, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had leaped past Belabbas and to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is no way out the back." he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "'Hold them here." And so side by</seg><seg type="columnLine">side with level pistols we held the now en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightened and angry crowd at bay, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wild urgings of Belabbas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The captain now added his pistol to ours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looking over my shoulder I perceived</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his men, three score of them at least,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I judged, had formed a double ranked line</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the doorway to the coffee house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let them come now, as they will," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said to Grey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I should prefer that you handle</seg><seg type="columnLine">this matter now, Captain," said Grey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Good then," returned the officer, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">raising his voice, commanded those within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room to come out. The game was up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and most of the conspirators were aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that fact. One or two at a time they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out, meekly enough, were passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the lane of soldiers to the coffee</seg><seg type="columnLine">house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">44</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There are those who will see that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are securely tied," explained the captain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Our prison will be full tonight. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes twenty-live so far."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are a few others then," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey, "in the back room. Including Bel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abbas."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Let us go after them." suggested the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain, and 011 the suggestion we moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the now empty front room. But we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not taken half a dozen steps before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little door was Hung open and four</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, Belabbas at their head, with a knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">in either hand, rushed forth. It came as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a surprise to us, took us off our guard in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, just as will the sudden opening of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">door when one is near to it. I chanced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be between Grey and the captain, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was therefore I who met the force of Bel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abbas' charge. I fired, even as the big bulk</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck me; then I felt myself toppled over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Belabbas leap through the doorway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One man, I saw, lay sprawled at the feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the captain. The two others were</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheeling about, trying to use their knives.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey and the captain called upon them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrender.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never," they cried. "Better to die</seg><seg type="columnLine">here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Very well, then," growled the captain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You shall have what you want." His</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol crashed twice, the two natives spun</seg><seg type="columnLine">about unsteadily, like tops running down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the instant Grey turned and leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the door after Belabbas. I fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed him. There came the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifles, soldiers were firing at a white figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleeing down the street, but their bullets</seg><seg type="columnLine">went wild.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take your men now to the Fez gate,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey called to the captain, "and disperse</seg><seg type="columnLine">those ignorant fools who are gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. Do not harm them. They have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been misled." He set off at a run, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">Belabbas, and I with him. I heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain giving swift orders to his men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard them falling into ranks and march-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing off as we ran.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Where, I wondered, was Belabbas mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for. He was leading toward the Fez</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate, I noticed. Possibly he thought to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to escape through the guards, to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door opened, to find sanctuary among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foolish followers of the false Mulai</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mohammed outside the gates. And surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, we drew closer and closer to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">portal. But abruptly Belabbas, who had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards start of us, dodged off into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a side street. When we reached and en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered it we saw at a little distance an open</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">double doorway, saw the cobbles of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">courtyard within. And on the instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">there came the sudden crash of horse's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoofs and Belabbas dashed forth, swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">his horse about and made off, the sparks</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying from the animal's iron shoes. Both</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us fired at the fleeing figure, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil himself seemed to be protecting Bel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abbas this day. Wherefore we ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting and ran to the counyard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are in luck!" cried Grey. "Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">are other horses!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WIFTLY wc mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and followed the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">made by the feet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">• Belabbas' horse upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cobbled streets. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a mad chase and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous one, T h e</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets of Arzila were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not made for rapid travel. It led us across ]</seg><seg type="columnLine">the town to the big north gate. The doors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gate were closed, I saw, as we came •</seg><seg type="columnLine">within seeing distance, but I could also see j</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white mounted figure of Belabbas and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darker figures of the guards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Stop that man." shouted Grey, "in the j</seg><seg type="columnLine">name of the Sultan." 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But even as he shouted the gates swung j</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, I saw the scatter of sparks as Belab- j</seg><seg type="columnLine">has' horse responded to the spur. The i</seg><seg type="columnLine">man we pursued had gained the long white |</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach which stretches from Arzila north- j</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As we raced through the gate I saw die j</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupid faces of the guards with open ^</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouths and eyes distended, but they of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered no impediment to our passage. And j</seg><seg type="columnLine">so we, too, gained the beach and saw ahead '</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us, less than a hundred yards now, the &gt;</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleeing horseman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a contest now between horse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh. The mount which Grey bestrode J</seg><seg type="columnLine">was bigger and swifter than mine. I ne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessarily fell behind a little. I maintained</seg><seg type="columnLine">my distance with Belabbas, but Grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained somewhat, and continued to gain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A quarter of a mile was flung behind us</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he had cut in half the distance from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Belabbas. Another quarter of a mile, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">although I was yet almost a hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind, I saw that Grey was riding scarce</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen feet behind the Moor. Why, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered, did he not shoot? He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely miss at that short distance. I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know then, as I learned later, that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend had determined to capture Belabbas</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive, but in a few moments more I wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nessed a startling thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARBARY BLOOD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The head of Grey's horse was at the tail</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Belabbas'. The Moor was hunched</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward over the saddle. I saw Grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike home the spurs, saw his horse leap</seg><seg type="columnLine">alongside that of the Moor, on the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. And then I saw Grey kick his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot free of the stirrup, throw that leg over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horse's neck and leap through the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">to descend upon the crouching figure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Belabbas. The next moment the two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them plunged from the beast as it reared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the impact, and fell upon the sand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I watched the struggle as I raced toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Grey had fallen underneath but in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly had thrown the Moor from on top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him. and reversed the position. I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a knife go flashing through the air; I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brandon Grey's right arm throw back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was near enough now to hear the impact</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a blow. When I swung from saddle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brandon Grey had risen, and Belabbas was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying unconscious at his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A noon sun saw Kaid Wazzani, captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the garrison marching off toward Fez</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his prisoners under heavy guard, saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">us riding forth for Tangier with the Sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">orita Valdez between us.

During</seg><seg type="columnLine">his absence, up Crow Point way. this gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man Spreen had ridden up to the O-Bar</seg><seg type="columnLine">and asked for Carson.

He had re-created the</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder; had interviewed Rutter and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">O-Bar boys.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dark, bitter-tongued rancher had</seg><seg type="columnLine">told how he had ridden with the punchers</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the trail toward Crow Point, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carson's failure to return had alarmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Told how they had found Carson</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawled upon the sand, found his horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quarter-mile away with bridle reins</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught in the ocotillos.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two weeks after the murder a peremp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory summons had come to Ware's Kid</seg><seg type="columnLine">from headquarters in Austin.

He staggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the barroom, grunting, whining,</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless. At last some instinct seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show him the door. He broke for it at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a staggering run and Ware's Kid, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Comanche yell, leaped upon his back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spurred him through it, catching hold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lintel and swinging down to the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Bull Branch lurched through and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawling upon the veranda floor outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> W7hen he came back, the bartender was</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-crouched against the back-bar, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes bulging.

They saddled, talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a little for the benefit of any ears that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be stretched toward them, of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">western road; that toward Eagle Ford.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a couple of miles they rode swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastward, then turned south on the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Mesquite. They were close to the rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">road always, riding through woodland.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnson led, because of his knowledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country. Soon he checked his mount</seg><seg type="columnLine">and jerked the Winchester from its scab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bard.

The rails J</seg><seg type="columnLine">before them began to hum. The train j</seg><seg type="columnLine">was upon robbers and officers with a roar. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">Came a frantic squealing of brakes and j</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scream of the whistle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The train had barely halted when there ]</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a rattle of shots along the track. It ]</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so dark that there was no clue to the j</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbers' positions save the orange flames ]</seg><seg type="columnLine">that stab-stabbed the night. Ware's Kid j</seg><seg type="columnLine">was conscious that Johnson was gone from I</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside him. He wasted no time thinking 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that, but ran crouched over up to the j</seg><seg type="columnLine">track, where he could fire at the robbers'</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot-flashes. From here he went into ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion with coldly precise fire from the car- 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">bine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who's that dam' jughead?" someone</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared. Evidently, thought Ware's Kid, 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was believed to be some misguided</seg><seg type="columnLine">member of the gang, firing into his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From between the cars came shots to j</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer the gang, now. It was pandem- j</seg><seg type="columnLine">monium, there in the pitchy night, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy roar of Colt's and the sharp, whip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like reports of rifles. A man could but j</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess, by the relative positions of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashes, at whom he shot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Ranger hardly expected to do much (</seg><seg type="columnLine">execution--his position made that a matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of chance. But he was worrying the Bass</seg><seg type="columnLine">men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly a Tiigh, clear, voice rang out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crying a name over and over again, pene- *</seg><seg type="columnLine">trating even the staccato din of the firing, j</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Simp Dunbar! Where you-all ? Simp</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dunbar-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A voice answered, but there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">diminution in the firing. Ware's Kid</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled down the track, having reloaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">WANTED</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his carbinc. With his first shot a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried out shrilly. He pumped the lever</seg><seg type="columnLine">and--his carbine jammed. He spat a bit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter curse. He knew instantly what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened--he had slipped a .45 pistol cart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge into a .44 carbine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A huge shape hurled itself at him. Me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanically, he threw up his carbine and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oncoming man ran into it. Then Ware's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kid, tugging at the butt of his seldom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">used Colt, leaped aside. A roar sounded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost in his ear. Then a hand caught his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. Instinctively he stepped close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his assailant, turned like a flash when a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol brushed him; dropped his Colt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the fellow's gtmhand with both of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his and hung on grimly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Somethin's wrong, boys! Let's git out</seg><seg type="columnLine">o' yere!" a cool. hr.if-laughing voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting, down the track--not the voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had called Simp Dunbar's name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fellow with whom Ware's Kid</seg><seg type="columnLine">grappled was swinging terrific blows at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lighter opponent. But the Ranger's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head was against his chest; the big fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low's fists but grazed their mark. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was tiring with his bulldog grip on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other's gunhand. Suddenly he released his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold and tried to leap backward. A heel</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught on a bunch of grass and he stum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled. A flash and roar from in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; a stinging pain across his head. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed flat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">E CAME to, conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a dull headache and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">next, of a dim light</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his head. After a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment of blinking, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceived that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting in a chair of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">railway coach. Next</seg><seg type="columnLine">he realized that the train was moving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How d' you-all feel, now?" inquired</seg><seg type="columnLine">an anxious voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Painfully he turned his head and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bos' Johnson's worried face opposite him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right puny!" he grunted truthfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnson grinned widely, relief in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What happened?" demanded Ware's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bullet creased you-all.

From the little sand dunes behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, to northward, came the flat, vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">report of a rifle.

He was sheltered</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the bullets within two steps, stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing behind his stallion's bulk. His hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">slapped the saddle horn; he was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle without touching stirrups and lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat upon the black's neck.

His great</seg><seg type="columnLine">sombrero hung down his back bv the chin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strap; from the scabbard beneath the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">fender had leaped a sleek Winchester car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bine.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighted carefully and drove three -44's to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust along the crest of the dunes, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen inches apart. Instantly the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifleman replied with a rolling quartette of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullets that bunched most efficiently be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the Ranger's carbine-muzzle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He watched narrowly without replying</seg><seg type="columnLine">in kind.

There was cover of a sort up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very base of the dunes. But the ambush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er's fire had been entirely too craftsman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like, too nearly deadly, to make the pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect of scaling the low slope before him</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem anything but the brief prebminary</seg><seg type="columnLine">54</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to a funeral.

A good many times, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Ranger detachment from Ysleta, hunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apache sign, he had camped there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Guess we better hole up there t night,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rutter grunted, staring across the flat to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beginning of that welter of arroyo-cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">hillocks.

The canyon floor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hard-packed earth, but studded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose stones and he placed his feet care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully. One never knew who might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">using the Tanks. From time immemorial</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been one of the favorite watering</seg><seg type="columnLine">places of this region. Wild animals and.</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild men, red and brown and white, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">there furtively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He passed close along the left-hand wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">decorated with Indian pictographs and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">names of pioneers, and so came to the low</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern in which was the spring-fed well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or "tank." More cautiously than ever he</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved now. The rock apron before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern was pitted with rxc/a/r-holes, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehistoric tribes had ground their corn;</seg><seg type="columnLine">rude mortars still used by the Apaches who</seg><seg type="columnLine">camped there. It was tricky footing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trickier still inside, where one approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the well-lip over a stone floor worn slick</seg><seg type="columnLine">as glass by countless feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  'T»nV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inside the cavern-piouth he squatted for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment and listened. He heard nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from without or within and slid his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully forward, balancing himself with</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hand upon a rounded slab that divided</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cavern in two sections.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he was awkwardly balanced when a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinewy arm shot around his throat from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind and a hough sounded in his ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A smallish, rather insignificant-seeming</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure was Ware's Kid. But "all whale-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone and whang-leather," as the Rangers</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had wrestled with him remarked</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazedly; a hundred and ten pounds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiry, flashingly quick, steel-strong body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now he moved automatically, fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting, "Indians!'' Sideways he whirled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so the Apache's knife went wide in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward drive. Back shot the Ranger's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, to smash into the Indian's face. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke his strangling hold and Ware's Kid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning half in air. his feet were sliding</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, shot a vicious fist into the Apache's</seg><seg type="columnLine">midriff, then had the buck by the throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was gripping him about the body with</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs closing like scissor-blades and fending</seg><seg type="columnLine">off flailing arms with elbows spread.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Apache was powerful, but before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had much opportunity to struggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ware's Kid had banged his back-head</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the rock. He managed a long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">loud, gasping groan. Feebly his knife-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand rose. The Ranger loosed the throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an instant and fumbled fer the wea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pon. It sliced his palm. Then he seized it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and buried it in the Indian's body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the Apache was limp--wise men</seg><seg type="columnLine">made very sure that Apaches were really</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead--the Ranger stood up shakily and</seg><seg type="columnLine">groped for the entrance. A stone slid</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into the canyon and he hurled him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self forward out of the cavern. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained the middle of the canyon, running</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a quarter-horse, there was thud after</seg><seg type="columnLine">thud of feet dropping from the rocks to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hard ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ran on his toes, hoping that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">make camp sufficiently ahead of these fleet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians to warn Rutter; hoping, too, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rutter had the horses together, had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken them out onto the flat to graze.

The firing was a continuous roll, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumbling multiplied by the canyon walls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As usual the Apaches had rifles as good</seg><seg type="columnLine">as any in that country, better than those</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Army. Rutter swore venomously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Ware's Kid had slashed the lariat with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his belt knife.

The moon came out and flooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desert with a white light that re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded the Ranger of Billy Conant's New</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fashion Saloon in El Paso when the elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tric lightsxvere turned on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Being Tighter and, perhaps, the better</seg><seg type="columnLine">rider, Ware's Kid led. He had lost a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred dollar saddle, but he was phlegmatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">about that. It was all in the game. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were lucky--he especially--to be riding</seg><seg type="columnLine">away with their hair. A sudden groan</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Rutter aroused him from his thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he looked backward under his arm in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to see the big man slide sideways off</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gelding and roll over upon his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ECHANICALLY</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ware's Kid whirled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stallion and glared half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">a-dozen ways at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">in search of the assas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sin. But the broad ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panse of greasewood</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cacti lay quiet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the incandenscent moonlight.

There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a .44 hole in Rutter's chest. How he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridden this far was the marvel! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ranger squatted there broodingly, watch-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing mechanically along the back-trail, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">case the Indians appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Want me to--sign a paper?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the painful whisper.

Ware's Kid bethought him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self suddenly of what Rutter had said</seg><seg type="columnLine">about signing a paper. He fumbled in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumper pocket and found a letter of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjutant general, the letter which had sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moned him to Austin three months ago and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so had brought him, indirectly, to sit here</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonight.

This might not clear up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery to everyone's satisfaction, but Dell</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spreen had no intention of coming back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to this part of the country anyway. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the adjutant general saw the confession it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would clear Spreen officially.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the girl would not be branded--</seg><seg type="columnLine">openly, at least--as the daughter of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brutal, callous murderer.

One day</seg><seg type="columnLine">a band of Indians stopped at the post and</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed, with difficulty, to get the talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to racing, and it was not long before</seg><seg type="columnLine">a race was arranged. They had with them</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big buck and his disreputable pony. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">forelegs looked to be about three inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick; its coat was rough, long, dirty and</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with burrs. The distance was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be two hundred yards, and neither side</seg><seg type="columnLine">had grave doubts regarding the issue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which materially helped along the bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the word was given the big buck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let out a yell, plied his whip and was yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the course before the thoroughbred</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew it was in a race.

The officers paid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed they had two horses that could get</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">away quicker, and they proposed another</seg><seg type="columnLine">race. There was more betting during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour allowed for the pony to rest, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second race was run, with the same result</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the first.

His outraged feelings choked him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while a chill fear of a hungry captain's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrath gripped his vitals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What--what--what--what?" the stew-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ard gasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't cook--I never did cook!"

His well-warmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind had dreamed of another bottle in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">galley. He had come to seek it, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mood told him that all the world could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevent his getting that other bottle. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the steward leaping at the cook, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mood told him that all the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world also wanted that other bottle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I might have known it," he whispered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he leaped, shouting, into battle--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the ship, hearing that shout, came run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning to enjoy.

He saw Epictetus--who</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently had successfully murdered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steward--engaged in wrecking the place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A vague memory of a dog tearing up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth trying to find a rat flashed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mind of the captain, but it did not in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form him that the huge Epictetus was seek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a bottle. Still dodging flying utensils,,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain observed a small man huddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling into a comer. This, the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">correctly deduced, was the cook.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When there was nothing left to throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the door except the stove, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have stuck.

With five men at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacking him, Epictetus really began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight. The Cockney and others favored</seg><seg type="columnLine">with ringside places crooned in ecstasy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For all that Epictetus had done before had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been as a mere zephyr to a howling hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ricane. But finally numbers prevailed--in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sense that Epictetus, somewhat out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition, got out of breath. Leaving his</seg><seg type="columnLine">four assistants to anchor Epictetus, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain, his nose bleeding, turned savagely</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the cook.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's this maniac doing in here?

The ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cook, in an ecstasy of agony, had crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">for safety into an upper bunk. This fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">was serious.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard life of the sailing ships made hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">men.

I'm going to jump overboard I</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drown myself!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Epictetus, who was physically incapable ]</seg><seg type="columnLine">of understanding such a state of nerves j</seg><seg type="columnLine">and inability to protect oneself, spoke |</seg><seg type="columnLine">gruffly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't be a damned fool!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't know what it means," 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">moaned the cook. "I'll jump over the side J</seg><seg type="columnLine">--unless I can find a place to hide. Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">can I hide on a ship so that nobody can</seg><seg type="columnLine">find me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Epictetus grinned, as would any sailor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this extraordinary question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No place a man can hide. But," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">added reminiscently, "I had a monkey once</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a ship where the Old Man hated mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keys. So I hid it in the fore peak. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">they found it in the end."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ex-cook was a nervous man, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had more nimble wits than Epictetus. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful idea came to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going to jump overboard and hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterward!" he announced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Epictetus leaned forward and shook him</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're crazy," he said briefly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not," said the cook animatedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Listen! I'll scream in the middle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. Then I'll throw something over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board that will make a splash. You'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SON OF A SEA COOK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">65</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">at the wheel, and you can shout 'Man over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board,' and while all hands is yelling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">backing the yards I'll hide down the fore</seg><seg type="columnLine">peak. After that you can pass food down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me--I ain't a big eater--or I can creep</seg><seg type="columnLine">out at night and steal it. When we get to</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York I can slip on shore!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Crazy," Epictetus said, laughing, "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't be done, even if I was fool enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">help you. You might make them think</seg><seg type="columnLine">you was over the side and drowned, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">you couldn't live down in the fore peak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because the hatch is kept on and you'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">smother; and you can't steal food--unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can get into the steward's pantry or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lazarette, and that's too hard for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary thief. You can't steal any of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men's allowance, you know!" Epictetus</seg><seg type="columnLine">concluded sternly, alluding to the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shipboard sins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I won't. I'm a better thief than you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think I am," said the ex-cook. "And you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can take the hatch off the fore peak enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give me air."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Epictetus shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If a bit of wind comes that can't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">done," he said. "The water coming over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bows would fill the fore peak, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would be hell."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe in bad weather I could find</seg><seg type="columnLine">some other place," suggested the ex-cook</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopefully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The captain's cabin, I suppose," grin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ned Epictetus. "Nice and warm in there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I'm going to do it, anyhow," ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed the ex-cook with unusual deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mination, "whether you help me or not."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The hell!" said Epictetus with some ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miration. "Oh, say, what did you do ashore</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you had to run? Tell me right, now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no fooling!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll never tell anybody?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll kiss the Book I won't!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the ex-cook told. Epictetus laughed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he never revealed the secret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I'm going overboard in an hour,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the ex-cook.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go and turn in," advised Epictetus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's your watch below. It's my wheel in</seg><seg type="columnLine">half an hour."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's why I'm going overboard to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drown when I am--when you're at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel," said the ex-cook emphatically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sailor's sometimes inhuman delight</seg><seg type="columnLine">in skylarking was exceedingly well devel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oped in Epictetus. He forgot the acces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ories. He forgot the fore peak hatch. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgot the food. He forgot everything ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept a delightful vision of the watch be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low being roused on deck--a watch for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">whom he had no affection--and of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands working frantically to save an</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagined drowning man, while all he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to do would be to twist the spokes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wheel occasionally. He answered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ex-cook with the utmost kindness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Go ahead and drown yourself," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T WAS the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch and a fine night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Halcyon mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about five knots an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour 011 a wind. Epic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tetus took the wheel at</seg><seg type="columnLine">two o'clock, as happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a boy going to a cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cus. The lookout was relieved, the mate</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked the weather side of the poop, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship grew quiet as the watch on deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">found soft planks. It was very dark. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly the quiet was broken by a ghastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">howl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good-by! Cruel world, good-by!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Followed by a tremendous splash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was done so naturally--not to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">dramatically--that even Epictetus joined</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cry, "Man overboard!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So naturally was it done that Epictetus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">obeying the order to "keep her up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind" wondered if his father had not, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, committed suicide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think it was the handle of the deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">pump," he muttered. "But I can find out</seg><seg type="columnLine">at eight bells."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile the ship was seething with</seg><seg type="columnLine">■well-directed activity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See anything of the man?" the captain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had rushed on deck, demanded of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand sent to the mizzen top.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Not a sign, sir," shouted the sailor. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think I saw the life buoy the mate threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a minute ago, but nothing of a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">near it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was the pump handle," thought Epic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tetus, relieved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They brought the ship back and close</seg><seg type="columnLine">alongside the floating buoy. But not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of the man overboard, and by this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time it had been established that the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cook was the victim. The captain called</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hands together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You may put a boat over if you wish,</seg><seg type="columnLine">men," he said gravely. "But we're right</seg><seg type="columnLine">alongside the life buoy, and there's no sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the poor fellow. Anybody see him fall ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No man had seen the ex-cook go over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board. An old sailor, named Evans, spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in answer to the captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "We can all see the buoy alongside, sir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and no man anywhere near it.

The man in the mizzen top can</seg><seg type="columnLine">see farther than we could in the boat, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sees nothing. I guess the poor little</seg><seg type="columnLine">feller's gone, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'm afraid so," said the captain sadly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Poor little chap, he wasn't used to ships,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and likely got up on the rail for something</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slipped."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But he shouted 'good-by/ or something,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir," said the mate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Let's forget that part of it," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man. "It's kinder."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hush and solemnity of death settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the Halcyon, the men who had bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lied the ex-cook overwhelmed with honest</seg><seg type="columnLine">remorse. They filled the yards again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed watches. Epictetus was relieved</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went forward to investigate. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pump handle. The other men spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly and regarded him with extreme sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathy. Epictetus was enjoying himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He scared me, though," mused the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. He saw the fore peak hatch was off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knew where his father lay hidden.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's all right for tonight, anyway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he went to his bunk with a dawning</seg><seg type="columnLine">realization of the trouble likely to be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">store. He had some difficulty stifling his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckles as he lay in his bunk smoking a</seg><seg type="columnLine">final pipe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The trouble began next morning. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore peak was the storehouse, below decks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for rope, paint and boatswain's gear. Need-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing new rope for a main royal brace, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second mate went forward. He found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore peak hatch off and swore. But as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have left it that way himself, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made no outcry. He went down the lad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der into the dark recesses of the place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed with a lantern. Presently he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">up again with the rope. He carefully re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed the hatch and went aft to the stew-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me have the rat trap. Steward," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "I heard a rat down in the fore</seg><seg type="columnLine">peak. Put a hunk of cheese in it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The steward produced the trap, duly</seg><seg type="columnLine">baited. Rats are never poisoned on board</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, as they would only die below and</seg><seg type="columnLine">become unpleasant. Instead, a large wire</seg><seg type="columnLine">cage trap is used, and the captured rats</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnish amusement for the sailors. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">second mate carried the trap forward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">deposited it down in the fore peak where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought it would do most good. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no idea of the good it would do. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowned man was very hungry. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no opportunity to steal anything. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour later the second mate investigated the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">trap. He found the cheese gone, but no</seg><seg type="columnLine">rat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's a clever rat," he mused, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on deck again, intending to get more</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheese and secure it with twine so the rat</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not take it without getting caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he merged from below lie ran into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Epictetus, who hastily concealed a ship's</seg><seg type="columnLine">biscuit which, had he arrived five seconds</seg><seg type="columnLine">earlier, he would have thrown down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore peak, probably hitting the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's a hell of a rat down there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones," said the second mate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A--a what, sir ?" asked Epictetus, star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A rat. A darned clever old bird, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Took the cheese out of the trap and never</seg><seg type="columnLine">got caught. But he won't do it again."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What are you going to bait it with now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir?" asked Epictetus, a trifle anxiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you think?" asked the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bread might be good. It goes well</seg><seg type="columnLine">with cheese, sir," answered Epictetus ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bread! Say, Jones, you must think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's a pet rat I have down there!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought the bread might tempt him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir," stammered Epictetus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tempt! That rat doesn't need tempt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. He's an old, tough bird, I tell you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dangerous. If we don't get him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gets real hungry, he's liable to come out</seg><seg type="columnLine">at nights and eat anything he can get. I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen sleeping sailors bitten by rats, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they got bad blood poisoning--so have</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir, I have," answered Epictetus</seg><seg type="columnLine">truly. "But this may not be that sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rat, sir--not a man-eating rat, I mean!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, see," said the second mate sarcas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically. "I suppose you would suggest I</seg><seg type="columnLine">bait the trap with pea soup, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He might--it might entice him into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trap, sir." Epictetus was a bit rattled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You can never tell, sir!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And a spoon for him to eat it with,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no, sir, he wouldn't need a spoon,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Epictetus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, he won't--because he won't get</seg><seg type="columnLine">soup," laughed the second mate. "Cheese</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the best rat food. And I'll fix the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece so no rat on earth can get it without</seg><seg type="columnLine">springing the trap."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did this to the best of his ability. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the trap in an hour or so. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheese was still there, as the drowned man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had enough cheese. But in the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog watch, when the second mate again in *</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SON OF A SEA COOK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">6 7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">vestigated. the cheese was missing. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">went aft and annoyed the captain by asking</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gentleman if he had a book in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin which told about the habits of rats.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HAT night a cake the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steward had prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the captain's special</seg><seg type="columnLine">use was taken from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pantry, leaving no clue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The steward did say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, that lying half</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep he had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy breathing. The second mate of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course blamed the rat, and carefully bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened down the fore peak hatch so the rat</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be kept prisoner until he could dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover a way of catching it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next night the second mate roused</seg><seg type="columnLine">the poor steward roughly out of bed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers' midnight supper, always laid out</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the end of the cabin table, was missing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why didn't the steward remember his</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty? In vain the steward protested that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had laid out a specially nice supper. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">second mate would not believe him, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not believe the rat had done it, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause there were no crumbs scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''But," he stormed, "some fellow is do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing this for spite. I battened down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore peak hatch and now it's off again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's a man aboard this ship that likes</seg><seg type="columnLine">rats better than he does me! But I'll get</seg><seg type="columnLine">him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next night the steward carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked up all food, asking the second mate</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wake him at midnight, when he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">arise and get the supper. It was one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those peculiar nights known only to the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a meteorological freak. A ghastly night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A night that got under the skins of sailors</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fed their superstitions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no wind. It was very dark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">muggily warm, the atmosphere full of elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricity; making men uneasy, uncomforta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble. Pale and seemingly slow flashes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning came suddenly out of the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">from nowhere, making the ship loom like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spectral ornament of a deserted ceme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery. Corpse lights--balls of electric fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the size and shape of skulls--floated</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the yards. Men shivered and prayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for wind. They spoke in whispers. Ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecting sudden and perhaps dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind from any quarter, the sails had</seg><seg type="columnLine">mostly been clewed up, which caused a</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird, skeleton effect when the lightning</seg><seg type="columnLine">came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The drowned man crept from his lair--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Epictetus having removed the fore peak</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hatch at some risk to himself. Along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark bulwarks the hungry one made his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way stealthily. He reached the cabin al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leyway and slipped in. But nowhere could</seg><seg type="columnLine">he find food. He could smell food, but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">only made things worse. Finally his bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">toes stubbed against the medicine chest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashed to the mizzenmast near the cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">table. Not knowing the ways of ships, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowned man hoped for a food locker and</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised the lid of the chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found only bottles and bandages. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingered the bottles, and smelled castor oil.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He groaned silently. Then his eager fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers clutched on another bottle. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sacred medicine chest bottle of brandy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept for accidents, to touch which is sac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rilege. But the cook did not know that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did know that he was hungry and weak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he knew brandy when he smelled it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took a large drink. He found it grate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful and comforting. He took another</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink, and felt as strong and brave as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Epictetus himself. But he did not want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be caught, and left the cabin quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Going forward to enjoy himself in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore peak, he saw the watch coming aft.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pie could not get past them.

This di-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">t version was nothing more than old Simone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Mexican vaquero. His horse slid to a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">71</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stop, and he fairly fell into the bunkhouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey!

Social lines on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Y Bar were very closely drawn. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexican hands lived with their families in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little village of jacales a quarter of a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ranch-house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mucho ftiego, senores!" sputtered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexican, when he caught his breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's that!" roared Old Man Gabe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who came up just as Simone's fuse quit</seg><seg type="columnLine">sputtering and he went off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No quiera Dios!

Blood drip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping from the fingers of his right hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bullet hole in the sleeve of his shirt cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roborated his story. Asked who was set-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting the fire, he said he saw only two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and they were Diamond L punchers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before Simone had finished his story.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Old Man Gabs had whipped out bis knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cut away the Mexican's shirt sleeve,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposing a bleeding flesh wound just above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the elbow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go to the house, Simone, and let Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Young doctor that arm," said Old Man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gabe, his voice suddenly gone soft and low</seg><seg type="columnLine">and humming like a tight wire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was his way.

In all civilized countries</seg><seg type="columnLine">arson has long been considered a crime in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the class with murder. Firing a man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">range, at a time like that, was arson of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worst sort.

Fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">lire in pear thickets just can't be done. Ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cording to Simone's story, the fire had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been started in open country about a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the chaparral. If they could reach it</seg><seg type="columnLine">before it struck the cactus, there was hope;</seg><seg type="columnLine">if not, there was none. So on they rode at</seg><seg type="columnLine">top speed, in spite of the heat. Half-way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the fire the speed and the heat were be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning to tell on their mounts. Already</seg><seg type="columnLine">some were dropping behind. In the lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">were Old Man Gabe, Zee and Gid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before they reached the fire they realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was too late. Suddenly the red smoke of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prairie fire changed to the thick, steamy</seg><seg type="columnLine">pall of the chaparral. From such glimpses</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they could get through the smoke, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew tliat the fire had been set well to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">west and carried in a line due south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aim to burn me clean out, I reck'n,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Old Man Gabe, in soft, vibrant tones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he stopped and waited for the others to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come up. "All right. We'll go talk to</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The others came up and stopped, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses heaving from running in the chok-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing heat and smoke-filled air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Boy?," said Gabe, sweetly, "I reck'n we</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to clean up that Diamond L outfit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'll just turn south, go to the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire, and see what we can find.

Don't crowd your horses too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much, or some of you'll be afoot."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keeping back from the smoke cloud,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they rode steadily south for two miles, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til they came to the worn trail that led to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palo Alto. Just as they reached the trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stocking-footed roan came storming</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, the stirrups of the empty saddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">flapping the bushes by the trail and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pony's scorched mane waving in the wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good God!" cried Young.

"You'll be burned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">death!" but Iris voice merely bounded back</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the wall of smoke and heat. Zee</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Gid were gone, right into the heart of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inferno, and the frightened roan had</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and followed them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, hell!" said old Gabe, as if he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to cry. "Four of you fellows go</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the ranch and direct the Mexicans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fire against this, and try to save a little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">j-atch of grass for the saddle stock.

A mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther across the black, desolate, burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">over ground they came to where the fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">was burning slowly back against the wind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just beyond the fire stood Jenny Young,</seg><seg type="columnLine">waving desperately at them.* They passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the slight fire and gulped a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaths of fresh air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, why--how'd yo' braunk get</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, Miss Jenny?" Zee asked, bashfully,- j</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Aip't hurt, are you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I'm not hurt, but-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better mount and go back to th'e store.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We're in a hurry and you can't get home</seg><seg type="columnLine">through this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--I don't want to go back to the store.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I want to go with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it's going to be rough where we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">goin .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't care; I'm going with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well'm, I reck'n you're the boss."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they thundered along the open prai-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rie, following the backfire steadily south,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way the firebugs had gone, Zee was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering. How tlie blazes did that roan</seg><seg type="columnLine">get away from Jenny? She could ride</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything on the ranch. She wasn't hurt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no indication that she had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown. Why wouldn't she go back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">store, instead of following them into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of hell? They rounded a grove of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mesquite trees and pear, and saw ten men</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming from the head of the fire and still</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a mile away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That can't be Old Man Gabe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">them," Zee muttered, as they pulled up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hell, no!" replied the keen-eyed Gid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thats' Dimunt L riders. Wonder where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they're goin'."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cornin' for us," replied Zee, grimly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was too late to turn and run for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little grove they had just passed. Any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, they couldn't have gotten into it, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was grown up with pear and chaparral.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Between them and the oncoming horsemen</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a deep arroyo. The race was now for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and the three had the advantage. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode down into the ravine while the Dia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mond L men were yet two hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">away but already firing at them. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom of the ravine they sprang from</seg><seg type="columnLine">NO QUARTER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">their horses. Zee helper! Jenny from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">stocking-footed roan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sit down on the ground, right against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank, Miss Jenny, and stay there no</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter what happens," he rapped out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no time for formalities. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">partners had jerked their carbines from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their saddles as they dismounted, and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">they turned to the bitter business in hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They didn't know just why the Diamond L</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys had opened on them, but they had,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was 110 time to ask questions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were less than a hundred yards from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ravine when Zee's rifle spat viciously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the foremost one of the gang pitched</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his horse, while the others slid to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop and gave back a bit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fire on a woman, would you?'' grated</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zee. as he threw another cartridge into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrel. "Get meat when you shoot, Gid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They won't give us time to reload."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a matter of fact, the Diamond L men</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been unable to tell that there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman with the partners, but it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made little difference. The fight was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. Shoulder to shoulder, under the bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">with nothing but a little cluster of pear at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top to shield them when they crept up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shoot, Zee and Gid faced the odds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">five to one. Gid got one, and the odds</seg><seg type="columnLine">were reduced to four to one, but the Dia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mond L men had 110 notion of quitting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight. They merely drew back a little and</seg><seg type="columnLine">substituted rifles for six-shooters. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were trying to cover their tracks. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought they had gotten old Simone, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now they were going to kill these three so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that no charge of firing the Y Bar range</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be sustained against them. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was little law in the cactus country, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was enough, and of a very sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dangerous kind, to make short work</seg><seg type="columnLine">of range burners it the charge was proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">on them. As Zee raised up to fire, a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect hail of bullets swept across the ravine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gid heard a soft thud and and saw a bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let hole in the lower part of Zee's right</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. Zee didn't even flinch, but kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gun working until another horseman</seg><seg type="columnLine">slid from his saddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some of that no two-bits stuff,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">growled Gid, as cartridges clicked through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loading gate of his carbine. "Look</seg><seg type="columnLine">out! They'll get you if you stand up that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Too late! Zee was standing up, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of his body exposed, and two more of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attackers went down under his level</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting. Then a bullet cut across the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his right hip; his leg went numb, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tailing, he rolled to the bottom o£ the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">73</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">resaca. With a yell, the remaining six</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept forward to the final charge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, and go with me," chortled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gid Stewart, as he laid his gun to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheek and at short range toppled two from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their horses. But the end was near. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">four were sending a storm of lead over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the little gulch of pear and tear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing loose the dirt on the other side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravine. Suddenly the attackers were swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a flank attack. Old Gabe Young and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his men had torn through the fire when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they heard the first shots. Another min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute, and those ten w'ould never fire an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other range. Old Man Gabe rode up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">peered down into the deep ravine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank God!" he cried. "There's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Jenny, but-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh. Daddy, Daddy!

Where the devil was everybody?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wanted to know some things. Was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">range all burned? Did they lose any cat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle, and--oh, a lot of things. He tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">call and found that his voice w-asn't work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.

An hour after it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">born it can walk on shaky knees and buck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling forelegs nearly around its proud</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother, and finds great comfort in leaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">against its maternal parent for support.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In appearance it is mostly legs, and wobbly</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs at that. When it is five or six days</seg><seg type="columnLine">old it is tough and begins to cavort a lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle, not always successfully, and sticks its</seg><seg type="columnLine">velvety nose into business which does not</seg><seg type="columnLine">always concern it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When its mother goes off to a distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">waterhole she hides it in a clump of grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">or weeds, with an injunction to "stay put"</seg><seg type="columnLine">until she returns; and "stay put" is one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the things the calf does to perfection. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted up by some curious cowboy it tries</seg><seg type="columnLine">to flatten and to assume the limpness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">jelly, and if annoyed too much it bawls</seg><seg type="columnLine">for help. When that bawl sounds across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the range the curious puncher knows just</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly what his next step should be--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hustles to his horse and he hustles pronto.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A cow of the old Spanish strain is nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a man on foot to fool with when her</seg><seg type="columnLine">calf calls for help.

Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the mother is to be considered; am'</seg><seg type="columnLine">other mother or any bull within sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pleading cry is due to arrive as a res-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuer and without loss of time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This worthless, gluttonous imp of Satan</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the light of its mother's life, especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it should be her first-born.

The sudden exposure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the nether end of his voluminous gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment had been a terrible blow to his shabby</seg><seg type="columnLine">genteel dignity. He had been a justice of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peace in a small town in the East and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still laboring under the delusion that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his person was sacrosanct. To him, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt tail jerking was as frightful an of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fense against civilization as the twigging</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the nose of a supreme court judge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He secured some relief by visioning him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self on the bench, with Jake Ender before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, loaded with chains, awaiting sentence</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some heinous crime.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused and looked sternly at the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aginary criminal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To be hanged by the neck until dead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead, dead," he muttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But that sentence failed to satisfy him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When a man was dead, his troubles were</seg><seg type="columnLine">over.

That would give the big brute</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to think over all the evil he had done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He returned to reality with a jerk.

He panted for power that he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">make its carefree citizens suffer. He vis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ioned himself suddenly elevated to dicta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torship. One of his first moves would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">to close Mike Holsom's place. He filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his glass to the brim when some one</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated him, but he felt a glow of self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">righteousness now. He saw himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">sternly "cleaning up" the town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All places of amusement would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed. Such "dangerous men'' as Jake</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ender he would put in jail. Such menaces</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the morals of the community as Mike</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holsom would be banished. His officers</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be busy arresting men and bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">them before him for sentence. Each ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest would symbolize the power and im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portance of Mayor Peter Trimmer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again he returned to reality with a jerk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How could he secure possession of En-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">der's claims, and thus gain wealth and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venge in one swroop? He had been in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp only a few weeks, and his knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mining law was as limited as his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehension of the frontier spirit. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know that Driftwood, though possess-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing all the trappings of the law, was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">a frontier town, and that it still regarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">possession of a mining claim as good and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient title, especially when the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">was backed by a determined occupant with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cocked rifle in his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, in his mental scurryings, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of Bird T.

He had some money,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bird was contemplating unloading a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trunkful of mining stock on the farmers</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his home state, but the Ender proposi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion would offer greater inducements than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peddling of specimens of the printer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">art. Once they were in possession of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">property, Bird's money would erect a flume</seg><seg type="columnLine">and install a hydraulic outfit. In a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">months, Driftwood would look up to Peter</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trimmer. With plenty of money to oil the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way he would then launch his political</seg><seg type="columnLine">career. First, mayor of Driftwood; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might find some excuse for the closing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mike Holsom's place and the placing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jake Ender behind jail bars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would not be a personal matter with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he told himself smugly; it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the improvement of the morals of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">community. Men would say, "Mayor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trimmer is a clean man." He could drink</seg><seg type="columnLine">in secret and slip down to some Eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">city when he desired to relax from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cares of office. Then, circuit judge one</seg><seg type="columnLine">term. After that, supreme judge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">state. Lastly a Federal judge, a life job,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with autocratic powers. Once a Federal</seg><seg type="columnLine">Judge, he could do as he pleased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once more he returned to reality with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerk. He must stop toying with the fu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture and stick to the present.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IRD T. WIPPET was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pony-sized man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">red curls and a cheru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bic face, but his lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored eyes, small and</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressionless, i n d i-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated his ability to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">out for his own inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ests. He used many startling expressions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was given to cannon cracker explosions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mirthless laughter.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">measured all men by the money they pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Trimmer found him seemingly dub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ious about the Ender proposition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Chances are, Pete, you don't know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're heading into," he said. "You al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways were hammer-headed. Looking at</seg><seg type="columnLine">you now. I see your head does look like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammer.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, if he secured the cooperation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little trickster, he would have to swallow</seg><seg type="columnLine">his insults. Later on, he promised him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, he would trim Bird's claws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You come to me," Wippet went on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"with a deal and nothing in your head to</seg><seg type="columnLine">put it over.

Jake</seg><seg type="columnLine">had .hauled the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed into the kitchen. Now, in his favorite</seg><seg type="columnLine">homemade rocker, his pipe drawing freely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he bade Di tell the story of his wanderings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and how he came to Thundering Bar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know you're wore out, son, but tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me all about it. so after you turn in I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">set here and figger a little 011 what I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">goin' to do for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was this way," began the boy in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm voice. "Father was sick so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">that mother said he wasn't any good. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">said she was tired of wandering around in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an old covered wagon and having children.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One day she went away. We waited for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. but she did not come back. Father</seg><seg type="columnLine">then said he would have to he both father</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mother to us and that I would have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">help him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He drove and drove, father did. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to find a home for us, a farm with</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees and running water on it. He was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">school teacher, and he taught us things as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we looked for the farm. But it was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard for him to work. I guess he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know how. Sometimes he'd get lost and</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know where he was. Once the</seg><seg type="columnLine">.wagon wheel broke and he didn't know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fix it. I remembered seeing a black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">smith fix a wagon wheel and so I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">father, but he couldn't fix it good. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had needles and thread, but he couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">sew good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mother couldn't sew either; she hated</seg><seg type="columnLine">sewing and cooking. Once a woman, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagon we met, sewed for us and she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">sew and cook good. But she had children</seg><seg type="columnLine">and couldn't look after us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Father said to me, 'Di, your mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not to blame for leaving us.

That's just what my father said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I remember every word he said and what</seg><seg type="columnLine">they meant. He was a school teacher and</seg><seg type="columnLine">taught us words, but it was hard for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get us something to eat and wear.

One</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning; I got up to build a fire and to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">some water. The girls got up and took</seg><seg type="columnLine">care of Raldv. But father didn't get up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We waited for him to get up, because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sick. I got breakfast--pancakes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grease--and then climbed into the wagon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and touched father. He didn't say any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. and I took hold of his arm. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know how I knew about it. but pretty soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew he was dead. I wondered what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would do. You see. Daddy Jake, it wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much that my father was dead as it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was so little to eat for the girls</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Little Raldy, and I had to look after</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought I wouldn't say anything to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pearl and Opal about father being dead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I told Ruby. She cried, but I told her</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hush, as we had to look after Pearl and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Opal and Little Raldy. So we covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">father up in the wagon, and took the good</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse and the cow and what grub we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started out. You see, one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses was crippled up, and father didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowT what to do for him, so we left him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I put the girls and Little Raldy on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse, with the grub and something to cook</seg><seg type="columnLine">with, and started out toward the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At night we camped.

We didn't see anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">but wild cattle on the prairies and some</seg><seg type="columnLine">deer when we got in the mountains. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished for a gun so I could kill some cat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle or deer and give the girls and Little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Raldy some meat to eat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When we got in the mountains we only</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a little flour left and a piece of salt</seg><seg type="columnLine">pork. The cow didn't give much milk, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Little Raldy needed it. I didn't know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do when I made pancakes out of the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the flour and fried the last of the pork</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gave it to the girls."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How about yourself, son?" asked Jake</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly, his hand on the boy's thin shoulder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Weren't you eatin' any of the flapjacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pork?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Di looked at him as if wondering how a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man could ask such a foolish question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, I was taking my father's place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't you see? If you're a man, you can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat when your sisters and little brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">need it. Don't you see how it was, Daddy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jake?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I sure do." smiled Jake affectionately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">97</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I sure see how it was, young pard.

He taught</seg><seg type="columnLine">us things, father did. Told us we must</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, 'No. sir,' and 'Yes, sir,' tell the truth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and never touch anything that did not be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">long to us. And he said, 'You must al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways love one another.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the girls were so hungry that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought it would be all right if I made</seg><seg type="columnLine">some pancakes out of your flour.

What</seg><seg type="columnLine">say you, son?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy sighed his relief. It was plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was used to repressing his emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. He leaned against Jake, evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiencing great difficulty in finding</seg><seg type="columnLine">words to express his gratitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll work for you when I grow up, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay for my grub and my sisters' and Little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Raldy's," he said finally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jake shook his head and drew the boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on his knee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's not it, Di," he rumbled.

Soon the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">room would be warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cheerful. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table a pan of apples and nuts.

One by one the little girls</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come to the man whom they adored</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kiss him goodnight. But Di always</seg><seg type="columnLine">liked to "stay up a little while." When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other children were asleep he liked to sit</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the side of his foster father and look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I just like to be with him," he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have said had he expressed his feelings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The five were soon convinced that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing in the w'orld that their foster</seg><seg type="columnLine">father feared and no obstacle he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcome. They never disobeyed him, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was too great a privilege to be asked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do something for him. His frown was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">calamity too great even to be considered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even Little Raidy wanted to do something</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Daddy Jake. He brought in wood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunting loudly.

When they thought of their days</seg><seg type="columnLine">of poverty, their love for their foster</seg><seg type="columnLine">father became more intense.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot of snow had cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered all the scars that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jake's pick and shovel</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made in the heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Thundering Bar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reduced the string</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sluice boxes to a thin dark line.

On</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back was a roomy saddle, on his shapely</seg><seg type="columnLine">head a hackamore. Jake discarded bits</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the cold weather. He wanted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses to be comfortable. Nig and Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">were so well-trained that they seldom</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed reining. A word would turn them</seg><seg type="columnLine">or halt them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wouldn't want a chunk of iron in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth to have to keep warmed up," Jake</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained to Di. "So when it turns off</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold no horse of mine is bothered with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit.

That means it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound stuff."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Between the shed and the cellar, or "root</seg><seg type="columnLine">house," ran a shoulder-high line of sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">chunks for the fireplace. Back of the line</seg><seg type="columnLine">of chunks w-as a great pile of seasoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">logs, ready for the saw and ax.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come what will," Jake told the children,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"we're goin' to keep warm and snug this</seg><seg type="columnLine">winter.

The cellar</seg><seg type="columnLine">was piled to the ceiling with provisions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From a nearby pine hung the carcasses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">two deer. On a stout shelf between the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">big cupboard and the cook stove a company</seg><seg type="columnLine">of squat bottles'stood at parade rest. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">them was placer gold--about fifty ounces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the precious metal. Jake had struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">one pocket out of which he had taken over</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty ounces in three days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Young'uns' luck," he called it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The children were getting their foster</seg><seg type="columnLine">father ready for a ride to Dave Strong's</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. Dave would return with him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">help build the girls' room. Di brought his</seg><seg type="columnLine">buffalo overcoat, cap and mittens. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls brought him his heaviest boots, his;</seg><seg type="columnLine">overshoes and an extra pair of thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">woolen socks. They would not permit him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to touch those articles. They worked like</seg><seg type="columnLine">little Trojans, pulling and tugging at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">socks and boots, grunting in their strugglei</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the overshoes. To be of service to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him was a great privilege. When he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned, they would pull off his overshoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and boots and scamper for his slippers. Di</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take his overcoat, cap and mittens</seg><seg type="columnLine">and put them away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now came Raldy with an old pipe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jake's favorite pipe was in his pocket, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thanked the little fellow elaborately and</seg><seg type="columnLine">put the old discarded pipe into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I swear," he laughed.

In fact, the vision of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the swimming-eyed men at the bar was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">very dim. It seemed to merge into a vi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sion of children.

The zoo had hung it</seg><seg type="columnLine">there to show what the hippo would be like</seg><seg type="columnLine">when full grown, for they had no adult</seg><seg type="columnLine">specimen; but it was causing the babu</seg><seg type="columnLine">much intense thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 TQ</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Babu Bugwan Dass dangerous agitator</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped on SS Poona tonight.

Bruce and Dayong</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vila, his native assistant who was known</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the books as S. 1046, had done their</seg><seg type="columnLine">best, too, when the Poona docked. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">exasperating, that inspection! If the babu</seg><seg type="columnLine">had only been a trifle fat, as most of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">were! But the shipload of coolies was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the three negroes, Crambo.

Bruce wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">keenly to know what the mighty words</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, so he sent Dayong, disguised as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buddhist pyit-shin, disciple, around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monasteries to see and hear the preacher</seg><seg type="columnLine">and let him know what he looked like and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what sort of doctrine he was preaching.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bruce had had some priceless messages</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Dayong at the seat of war.

To him as a Malay and a wanderer</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had seen much of life, all this talk of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruling by the many was "wuzzy-wuzzy."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The many were fools; they knew nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of government and would simply vote as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pongyis told them. Give him a sul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tan ! One with a strong sword! And that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sultan was the British Raj, a benign and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneficent sultan, as anyone could see.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therefore this babu with his pestiferous</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea was a trouble maker and a dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">agitator, even as Tuan Bruce had said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thing to do was to get him out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kyaung alone, somehow, and with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">written evidence of sedition upon him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he and Tuan Bruce could arrest the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolish babu.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dayong noticed a pongyi looking at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackly from an alcove and made haste to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross his legs in the attitude of the Buddha</seg><seg type="columnLine">and go on with his work. He belabored</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself mildly for forgetting that the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortable Malay squat was dangerous here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tt irked him, this cross-legged posture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the infidels; the other was natural, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not help relaxing into it sometimes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, things were coming along. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">babu was going to dictate a pronuncia-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lx3</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mento-, soon, to be sent out to all the forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand monasteries of Burma. Then it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that Dayong took steel stylus and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strip of palm leaf from his writing ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terials and wrote his "with much glad*'</seg><seg type="columnLine">message to Tuan Bruce. He rubbed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scratches with an ink rag, bringing out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the writing sharp and distinct, folded it</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a packet, tied it with a bit of leaf strip,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went out to throw it over the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pound wall where his shop boy would find</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Thus simply had they arranged the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tails of communication.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had hardly got back before the babu</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the niche. He was puffed up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">importance now, breathing heavily with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the profundity of his thoughts, his black</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes with their yellow whites staring as</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of a seer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take stylus and write, disciple!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said grandiloquently. "I, the Rao Bugwan</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dass, lama of the temple which is in Mind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">napur, do call on all Monasteries of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Way in Burma to rise against the oppres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sor ! Put that in Burmese, disciple."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dayong scratched the round curlicue</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burmese characters on the fine-ribbed tali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pot palm leaf.

Since the days of the kings, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">has any pongyi had a voice in the govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment ?" Followed a turgid diatribe against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the British Raj, the gist of which was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">command for all monasteries throughout</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burma to unite in demanding the vote.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dayong hummed with unholy glee as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrote. If the babu had simply confined</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to the vote he would have been per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly safe, for there was no sedition in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he simply could not keep the szvaraj</seg><seg type="columnLine">jargon out of it, incendiary and treasonable</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk that no government would tolerate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pronunciamento took four long strips</seg><seg type="columnLine">to set forth; when Bugwan Dass had</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed it, Dayong did the strips together</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a booklet, an enigmatical smile play-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing across his hard Malay features. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the babu now! Remained a way to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">him out of the kyaung, just once, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The babu, having got that weighty mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter out of his system, was in a mood for</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation. He liked this disciple who</seg><seg type="columnLine">could talk Hindustani. The language diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culty had barred him from much discourse</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the pongyis. Dayong considered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">innate curiosity of all babus, their greed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for miscellaneous knowledge, and thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon how he could make this foible profit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">114</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">able. Well, aside from the sea, natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">history was the subject that he was most</seg><seg type="columnLine">up on. Babus were generally interested in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, too, because most sahibs were, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave them excuse to air their learning</seg><seg type="columnLine">when talking with sahibs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Dayong had a gorgeous idea. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">bethought him of that baby hippo in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">zoo and the skull of a full-grown one hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the tree over his tank. Why not</seg><seg type="columnLine">challenge the babu's grasshopper mind with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that? He led the conversation artfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">around to animals, and from that to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">habit of some of them of shedding their</seg><seg type="columnLine">antlers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hippo sheds his skull, you know,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Dayong casually, in corroboration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sheds his skull!" The babu gasped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But how can an animal lose his head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">live, disciple?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nay, quite easily! He grows a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">one underneath, as does the snake," re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torted Dayong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing would do but the babu must see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that marvel to believe it! Dayong had but</seg><seg type="columnLine">to mention the evidence, right here in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rangoon Zoo, and he had him. That night</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was that he had sent off the "must be"</seg><seg type="columnLine">message to Tuan Bruce.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UT Dayong was due for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unpleasant surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">next morning.

He decided immediately to</seg><seg type="columnLine">jump the compound wall at the first chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">and join the babu outside. He simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not let this chance be Inst! And lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be if he did not go along, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tuan Bruce could do nothing without him</seg><seg type="columnLine">but look over his man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That chance was denied him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come with me--novice who squats!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarled the bigger of the guards, seizing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him firmly by the arm. Dayong had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad impulse to throw him off and make</seg><seg type="columnLine">good his escape, for those last words were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ominous. They had been watching him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspecting him. There is a peculiar but</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmistakable posture in the Malay squat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ease to it, due to long usage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was led into the presence of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">venerable sawdaws seated in the glory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their white robes in an inner room. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween them was the hard-faced abbot, mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of the monastery, yellow-robed, eyeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him malignantly as the two guards brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dayong before them. And, salaaming low</seg><seg type="columnLine">at one side, was a wretched Hindoo coolie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps one of the sudras who worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is Dayong Vila who keeps the animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">shop in China Street, O Presences," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man declared after one look at Dayong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what of it, O Greater Glory?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Dayong unabashed, though his heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pounding inwardly. "May not a poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">shopman become a novice in the Way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Life?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True." quavered the venerable one.

Nor could</seg><seg type="columnLine">he prove othenvise. However, he searched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Malay thoroughly and gave a "Ha!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">of discovery as his hand encountered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">leather charm bag hanging about Dayong's</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck by a thong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It contained a charm very potent in love</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs, nothing less than the pelt of an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">born tiger cub and six bristles from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother's chops.

Eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning lauds, like a strong Gregorian chant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in many male voices, sounded from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monastery. It grew dark and the big stars</seg><seg type="columnLine">spangled overhead a velvet black sky. Later</seg><seg type="columnLine">came lanterns, novices with hammers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chisels. The chains were cut where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">encircled Dayong's tree. Dayong heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the silent struggle and heavy breathing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">coolies carrying the bronze Buddha on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">dais out of the monastery gate. Up under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black roof of the stairway it would go,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be lodged, in the pitchy darkness, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">niche up under the base of Shwe Dagon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then the moon would rise--and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">time would come!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CON after Dayong was</seg><seg type="columnLine">led to the gate, sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded by eager and</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited novices all try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to grip him fast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ahead in the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long procession of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pongyis had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed.

A dozen followed, with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their midst, two of the biggest holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, the rest in lines on each side and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind. But they were amateur jailers at</seg><seg type="columnLine">best, thought Dayong with a subtle Malay</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile, as he slowly gathered chain links up</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his fists with his fingers. They should</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have left those chains on him! As it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, they made fine striking weapons. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden wrench, both arms lashing out with</seg><seg type="columnLine">those chains flailing--he was tensed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for it as soon as the first sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tuan Bruce and his Sikhs appeared!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But they passed up the steps without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">least hint of any rescue party.

Surely Bruce Tuan and the Sihks</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be hidden in the bushes on either</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the low brick walls that guarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">this staircase! But the procession contin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ued up and up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Baik!" (Very well, then!) thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dayong. "Letter, 'im e no find. Can do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone.

A sudden leap, striking right and</seg><seg type="columnLine">left with them, then a dash for escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were three other staircases leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">DAYONG GETS MISLAID</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">down from Shwe Dagon, and only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">pongyi guarded each at night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moon was a slender sickle in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">east when the procession came out on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform of Shwe Dagon. Dayong looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">around curiously. It was empty and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted of human beings now, a vast space</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flat paving faced by the four archways</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the stairs. It was planted thick with</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall poles of silver and gold with glittering</seg><seg type="columnLine">jewels hanging from the tis at their tops.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were votive offerings from wealthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buddhists all over the East, but Dayong</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarded them as so much wondrous loot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ruminated on how it would be to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">dacoit and grow rich.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They passed shrine after shrine around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the base of the Great Golden Pagoda, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">each a Buddha-image of marble, alabaster,</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver, gold, malachite, all life size and</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth millions of rupees. Up above in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night towered the gleaming gold shaft, ris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in huge rounded swelling curves to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ti high in the sky nearly four hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">above. A continuous tinkle of silver bells</seg><seg type="columnLine">came floating down from the ti; with it the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dusky flash of jewels sparkled down from</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the faint light of the moon. Dayong</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely noted that it was after midnight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the electrics that outlined Shwe Dagon</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been turned off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They reached the shrine of the bronze</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buddha. Calm, cross-legged, it sat in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths of the niche, eyes closed, the enig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matical smile of Asia playing on the thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips, the right hand holding a carved lotus</seg><seg type="columnLine">flower of white moonstone. A single huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruby smouldered at the peak of the crown</seg><seg type="columnLine">of green bronze naga scales that covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head of the image.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As one man the whole procession went</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat on their faces before it. The vener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able sawdaw droned a chant; there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">responses at intervals from all the kneeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines of yellow robes. The moon rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly higher as the ritual of installation</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on and on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Om--nrani--padnc--hum!

All the worshippers sat up cross-</seg><seg type="columnLine">legged. Novices around Dayong tore off</seg><seg type="columnLine">his yellow robe and stripped it to shreds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus making him a nothing, a less than an</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal. Dayong squatted back, only in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">loin-cloth now--but ready with a fistful of</seg><seg type="columnLine">chain in either hand. All this adoration</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the image of a mere man who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed to have discovered the only way of&gt;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">II7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Life was to him but the foolishness of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "For Allah, he is God, and there is none</seg><seg type="columnLine">like unto Him!" That verse of the Koran</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept ringing in his ears. Dayong was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressed.

His muscles tensed like</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel under the grip of the two novices who</seg><seg type="columnLine">held him. The babu had got behind him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dayong listened with junglewise ears. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last and nearest footfall, he was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then there was a general gasp, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Buddha had suddenly come to life!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AYONG saw that its</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were now open</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looking upon them</seg><seg type="columnLine">all sternly from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths of its niche. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard low cries of awe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fear, of sheer terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">arise from all the pon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gyis and novices, heard the babu behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him gibbering like a scared ape, and felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the novices that gripped him loosen their</seg><seg type="columnLine">holds. Slowly as the timeless movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an automaton the Buddha swung out its</seg><seg type="columnLine">left arm. Ghastly green in the moonlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was, its index finger pointing directly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bugwan Dass. The whole monastery went</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat on their foreheads before it, this mira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cle, this incarnation of the Lord Buddha in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of his own statues.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had convincing precedent for it--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Buddha in Amarapura who shed tears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">prophesying calamities; the one in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seyin temple who spake oracles hollowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every one of them devoutly believed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this one was miraculous and went pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trate in frightened prayer before it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">babu's teeth were chattering before that ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cusing arm, his knees knocking. The ve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neer of his Western education had left him</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a rent veil and his Hindoo elder gods</seg><seg type="columnLine">took possession of him.

Dayong recognized that face in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly--Bruce Romney's--and smote</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily upon the balm's bowed head with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a welt of his chain. Obeying further signs</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Buddha he picked up the uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious babu and carried him behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prostrate lines of pongyis to join his chief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had now leaped noiselessly down from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the niche.

This tap would be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on his own land half way. and he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">secretly acquiring right of way the rest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the ten miles. He knew a private line</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hadn't the right of eminent domain, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he didn't purpose being held up by some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">greedy land-owner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Tom Stone, whom the lumberman had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ordered to his presence, was a timber-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cruiser.

When he left the Byn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">um cabin, his hopes lay in ruins about him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This interview with Viney had raised them</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. True, their only support was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerve and staying qualities of a girl, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">then--Viney had beaten an alligator to</seg><seg type="columnLine">death with a club to protect her own. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad grin spread over Tom's face as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old plug splashed on through the swamp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mentally Tom weighed the situation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course Smedley would try to close the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal for Bynum's land. He knew all about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the millions of feet of fine pine and cypress</seg><seg type="columnLine">timber. He had Tom's figures on it, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same as he had on the Holderness land.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew Bynum's land was worth at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred times what he had offered for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it.

With-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the Bynum forest, even if Smedley</seg><seg type="columnLine">could steal the Holderness stumpage, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aid of Nelms, he would have no great</seg><seg type="columnLine">field to work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom sighed as he came out into the cut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over lands near town.

Just the will of a slender girl be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween him and the failure of a great idea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If he had a little money it would be dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent. When he had paid the livery sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble for the use of the old crow-bait that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">124</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had ridden on that wild goose chase, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have less than five dollars left. Fu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture events were on the knees of the gods,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he must leave them whether he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">or not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OM STONE had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Smedley Lumber</seg><seg type="columnLine">Company on a Monday</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon.

So rapidly had</seg><seg type="columnLine">events transpired that</seg><seg type="columnLine">b y Wednesday morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Tom had thrown his coat on a pile of</seg><seg type="columnLine">slabs, at a little sawmill that was slabbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross-ties in a belt of hardwood timber a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile north of town. He had a job and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeding to earn his keep while the game</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on. Old Sam Smedley. president of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Smedley Lumber Company, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">figuring furiously with a stump of pencil</seg><seg type="columnLine">since it was light enough to see. Finally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced that two and two make four, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">also that figures don't lie, he turned to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">off-color underling in the office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is Bill Boston here?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir.

Outstanding among</seg><seg type="columnLine">other visits was the Saturday night that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Dad Bynum spent togetlier on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bayou. When they put out set lines, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat by the camp-fire, smoking and talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">of many things. At daylight they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken a forty-pound cat off one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks and carried it to the cabin. Viney</seg><seg type="columnLine">'ried a great dish of the white meat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they feasted. Afterward, Tom and Dad</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent most of that Sunday morning walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the wonderful Bynum Bottoms</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom explained how a timber-cruiser esti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mated the value of a forest. They stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">under a giant cypress tree, and after a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment's calculation he told Dad there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">three hundred dollars worth of lumber</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that one tree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shore sold this land a lot too low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom, accordin' to yo' tell, and I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt it none," the old man said. "If I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could 'a* talked to you a little sooner it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might been different, but hit air too late</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. I done give my word/'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was when Tom gave up all hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thwarting Smedley in his steal of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bynum lands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An honest man may be the noblest</seg><seg type="columnLine">work of God, but I don't see why He made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the honestest ones the damnedest fools,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he muttered to himself as he rode home</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">N THE following Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day morning surveyors</seg><seg type="columnLine">began running the line</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the narrow gauge</seg><seg type="columnLine">road to Smedley's mill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was done in two</seg><seg type="columnLine">days, and two gangs be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan work, one at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town and the other at the mill. Smedley</seg><seg type="columnLine">had hung up a prize of five hundred dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars for the gang that reached the half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way point first. The surveyors ran the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line straight, and in doing so ran within</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty feet of Laish Taylor's old cabin on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "bandoned land." By chance, the half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way stake was right in front of the cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill Boston was promoted again and put</seg><seg type="columnLine">in charge of construction work, beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the mill. A mile would cover all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grading on the route. The rest, and partic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ularly on Bill's end, was trestles through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the swamp. Steadily the two ends of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road drew together, through the long, hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">summer months, while the water was low.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Work at the Smedley mill ne/er slackened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Millions of feet from the Holderness tract</seg><seg type="columnLine">were being sawed and stacked, against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening of the road.	f</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first of August saw Smedley s</seg><seg type="columnLine">money gone, but he was in high feather.</seg><seg type="columnLine">LONG-LEAF LANDS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He borrowed fifty thousand dollars and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a blanket mortgage on his holdings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That, he felt, was not asking a favor. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was giving some idle money a job, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">collateral was worth ten times that much.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had nothing to worry about, now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing to do but work, and wait for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">harvest'.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big yards at the railroad were fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished, and the sign "-Smedley Lumber</seg><seg type="columnLine">Company," was on roof and sides, in let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters four feet long. The planing mill was</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished, and the new machinery installed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam Smedley was a keen business man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he knew lumber from the stump to</seg><seg type="columnLine">market. He was leaving nothing undone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the yards at his mill were carloads of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clear hard pine flooring that the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">world was begging for. He had advance</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders for all the lumber he could ship in</seg><seg type="columnLine">three months with the best of luck. Noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing could stop him now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Came mid-September and cooler morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings. Just a month now until every gap</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be closed. The Bynum tract would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be definitely the property of Sam Smedley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which assured timber of the finest for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mills. Another week, now, at most, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream of lumber would be pouring over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the narrow-gauge road, all in plenty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to take care of Sam Smedley's finan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cial obligations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The surveyors and construction gangs</seg><seg type="columnLine">had named Laish Taylor's old cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Swamp Eagle," and had dubbed it divis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion headquarters. One evening Bill Bos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, whose gang was in the lead for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prize money, had his men throw some</seg><seg type="columnLine">tools and odds and ends into the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Three more days, and a little extra</seg><seg type="columnLine">work," he cheered his weary men, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll win that five hundred."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Boston's end of the trestle was then</seg><seg type="columnLine">within three hundred yards of the stake at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin door, while the other gang was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about half a mile away. The next morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, Boston, with some of his men. went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the cabin to get their tools. As they ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached the place they saw a thin spiral</seg><seg type="columnLine">of smoke issuing from the stick-and-dirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">chimney. They also saw their tools and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other things in a ragged heap on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground outside. Standing in the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stem of his pipe clenched in his strong,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even teeth, stood Tom Stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the hell are you doin' here?" de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded Boston.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I live here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, you do?

Finally, in his rage</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the prospect of losing the prize, he used</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fighting word, fully intending to back it</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and back it he did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In front of the old cabin was a little plot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bermuda grass. This became a battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground for two giants. Bill Boston, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger and stronger man, went in a flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rage. Tom Stone went in calmly on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the defensive and coolly alert for every</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage. He hadn't expected to fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Boston, whom he knew to be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">champion scrapper of the mills. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought the big foreman would listen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason. He had no quarrel with Boston.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam Smedley was the man he was after.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Boston was the aggressor from the start</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fight. Back and forth they fought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the plot of grass. Once Boston</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck Tom a staggering blow, causing him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reel backward a step. His foot struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the half-way stake, and he fell his length</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ground. Boston sprang forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">to jump in Toms face with his boots, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of his men caught him and told him he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to fight fair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you. boys," said Tom, getting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet, one eye half-closed and blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">dripping from his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From that on the fight was an attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to murder with bare fists. Weary and</seg><seg type="columnLine">panting, the men fought on, each growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">weaker. It had begun to look like any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body's fight, and if there had been betting</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the ringside there would have been no</seg><seg type="columnLine">odds. In the midst of the dogged battling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when blows were coming slower and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">less force, it occurred to Tom that after</seg><seg type="columnLine">ail Bill Boston represented Sam Smedley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The mill owner had hired this man to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dirty work. A surge of berserker rage</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up in Tom's throat. His muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensed again. Boston made a wild swing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him, and in that instant some terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">force came up under Boston's chin. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">head snapped !&gt;ack; he measured his length</seg><seg type="columnLine">130</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ground, and lay quite still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half an hour later, Bill Boston sat up</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the grass and stared about him. Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stone was sitting in the cabin door, bathing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his swollen face and hands in a bucket of</seg><seg type="columnLine">salt water. The other men, having revived</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill Boston, were standing by and looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, ready for the next round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you want any more?" asked Tom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through swollen lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hell, no! I'm whipped!" Bill tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Glad you've got sense enough to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. That's one fight you could have got</seg><seg type="columnLine">along better without. Now, take your</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and your tools, get off my land, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'll do that, but you better get off, too,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">growled Boston. "Old Sam Smedley ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">apt to take what I've took."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's apt to take a whole lot worse if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he tries to build a railroad across my</seg><seg type="columnLine">land."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The construction gang took their tools</seg><seg type="columnLine">and departed. When they reached the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their work they saw where Tom had set</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a row of blazed stakes, showing his line.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doggedly they stacked their tools and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trudged off toward Smedley's mills. Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on bathing his bruises, He expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have Sam Smedley on him within a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours, but the day passed, night came on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and still no one came from the mill. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distance, Tom could see the other con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction gang pushing forward with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom Stone was not to be deceived by</seg><seg type="columnLine">this inactivity on Smedley's part. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mill-owner too well, and he also knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vindictive spirit of Bill Boston. Bill's</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanity could never survive the beating</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had taken unless he could in some way</seg><seg type="columnLine">make reprisal. So, a little while after dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom left the cabin and took refuge in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thicket of alders that grew about fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards north of the house. Here he</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched and waited. It had not occurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him to arm himself, other than with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">two mighty fists, but as he sat there wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing developments he regretted that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not done so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was near midnight when Tom saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">two bulky forms, appearing almost too big</seg><seg type="columnLine">for men, approaching from the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction. They disappeared into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow of the cabin, moving noiselessly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A little later a match flared, and in its red</seg><seg type="columnLine">glare Stone recognized the battered face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Bill Boston, who held the match in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and by the side of it the baggy jowls</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Sam Smedley. Boston stooped and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">placed the lighted match; then the two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and walked rapidly away, back to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward Smedley's mill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 houghtlesslv, fom sprang forward to</seg><seg type="columnLine">put out the fire and save the cabin. Just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">his foot struck into the pile of rich pine</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the two men had stacked against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, and that had made them look so</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulk)' to Tom. a gun cracked. A bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">fanned by Tom's face and bedded itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the logs of the cabin. The splinters</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered, and the blaze went out, just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">two more bullets spattered against the wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom crouched to the ground, and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullets whined over his head. After that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could hear the two men walking hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riedly away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The months of suppressed rage at Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smedley now flared to frenzy in Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stone's heart. Hell was really beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pop as the old timber foreman had said</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would when Tom got mad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LD JUDGE BINDLEY</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a habit of going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his office .very early in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning and after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward going back home</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his breakfast.

"Why, what the-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom sank into a chair by the battered</seg><seg type="columnLine">old table and told the judge of his fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Bill Boston.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'd 'a' give fifty dollars, pore as I am,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have seen that fight--if the other fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks any worse than you do.

Tom Stone's anger was deep and</seg><seg type="columnLine">relentless. ^ The judge wondered that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">young fellow could harbor such a frightful</seg><seg type="columnLine">grudge against Smedley just on account</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crooked lumberman ordering him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">steal. Tom s was a rage that might sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he slept, but it would flare up again</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as he woke. In his present state</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mind, nothing but Smedley's life would</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfy him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the other hand, Smedley, greedy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last extreme, had almost had his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a cold million, and now he faced utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruin at Tom Stone's hands. If die two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men met, one of them would be killed--•</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps both of them. There would be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of compromise in Tom's mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if Smedley came begging for it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing short of the utter crushing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smedley's business, even if he didn't take</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lumberman's life, would ever satisfy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom. How to keep the men apart until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they cooled a little, was the problem. Or</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather, until Smedley cooled--Tom Stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">never would.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old judge was pondering these</seg><seg type="columnLine">things when Sam Sinedley stepped into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Judge, I need a good lawyer!" he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without other greeting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes?

The surgeon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">major sidled up to Cap'n Bob, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found his coat and was putting it on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I "Er--pardon me, but you are a ship cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain, I presume?" lie said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir.

"Who is he, any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nobody seems to know. The bartender</seg><seg type="columnLine">says he never saw him until two hours ago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some captain whose ship got in late this</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon probably." The surgeon-major</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked around and stepped closer to the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">whaleman and lowered his voice. "I say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain, this might get you into a rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">nasty mess. Court proceedings and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, y'know. This man has the appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance of being severely injured. I've sent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for the stretcher to take him to the hos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pital. He may be there for some time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which means that your ship will be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained here indefinitely. Very awkward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">y'know!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Awkward as hell, sir!" agreed Cap'n</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob, who had been listening with ever in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creasing dismay as the surgeon summed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," continued the surgeon-major,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm not advising you or interfering in</seg><seg type="columnLine">any way, merely suggesting that all in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conveniences arising from this situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be avoided by leaving port instantly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Up anchor and away. We'll take care of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir," acquiesced the skipper, rub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing his aching jaw. "I guess that's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best way out of it. Damn the luck." he</seg><seg type="columnLine">added mentally. "Here I've only arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">in port from a cruise on the 12-40 grounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">(Latitude 12N; Longitude 40W) three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours ago and now I got to go to sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What was even worse, he reflected, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be compelled to leave port without get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting his letter from Rose Russell. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter, due on the schooner Lottie Beard, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whaling tender running between New Bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford and St. Helena, would tell whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">her father had consented to let her marry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cap'n Bob: and if so, whether she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to Cape Town--at which port the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stormy Petrel would call in five months.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There the ceremony could be performed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Lottie Beard was expected to arrive</seg><seg type="columnLine">any hour now, yet he could not wait for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. To sail meant five months more of</seg><seg type="columnLine">torturing suspense before he learned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outcome of Rose's letter, written from</seg><seg type="columnLine">New Bedford to her father in Kamchat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kan waters, telling of her engagement to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cap'n Bob and asking the consent to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">marriage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's some of my orderlies coming to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take this man to the hospital." whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surgeon-major. "Goodby and a pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant voyage."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thanking him heartily, Cap'n Bob and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit mate slipped through the nearly de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted barroom and hurried down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing place, where the skipper engaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">a boatman to take them off to the vessel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With his broad shoulders bowed Cap'n</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob sat in the stern sheets and gloomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the bottom-boards as the boat went</seg><seg type="columnLine">skimming over the moonlit water. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain hell, he reflected over and over again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have to sail without hearing a word</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Rose. But if he stayed and the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was delayed on account of this mess, as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">A CUPID IN SEA BOOTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">undoubtedly would be, he would lose his</seg><seg type="columnLine">command. No owner would tolerate a</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipper, blameless or not, who had been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of keeping his ship from pursuing</seg><seg type="columnLine">her voyage. And this was his first com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When nearly to his ship he was roused</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the noise of an anchor chain roaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a hawsepipe, which echoed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quiet harbor as the sound waves re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounded from the granite head. A little</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclamation of joy escaped from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffed lips as he saw that a three masted</seg><seg type="columnLine">schooner had come to anchor about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cable's length outside of the Stormy Petrel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Lottie Beard's in, sir!" announced</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Hocker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SEE. There's a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get our mail yet. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">go aboard my ship and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then you take the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and go over to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">schooner for our let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters," said Bob eagerly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a few minutes they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were alongside the gangway. Cap'n Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about to grasp the manropes when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate shoved a cigar box into his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Careful ye don't drop it, sir!" he cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the devil's in it?" rasped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipper, his nerves worn to a frazzle by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the events of the evening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yer winnin's. The bartender put 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the box an' give it to me for ye."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damnation! I'd clean forgot it. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">right.

Cap'n Bob watched it for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little, lamenting the fact that his battered</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition prevented him from going him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self and having a talk with Captain Mark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">and.

Going into his own cabin, the skip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per surveyed himself in the glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Holy mackerel!" he ejaculated. "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty glad Rose isn't here to see me now."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The next twenty minutes he was busily oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupied in bathing and dressing his numer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous injuries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">139</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This done, and arrayed in a clean suit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of white duck, he left the room and glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at the clock under the skylight. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten-twenty. He saw the cigar box lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the table and was about to open it when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heard the boat bump against the gang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. And the next moment there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">floating down to his ears a musical and</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinctly feminine laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Puzzled, Cap'n Bob stepped to the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">door leading into the forward cabin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood listening, a sudden apprehension</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightening the strings of his heart. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard Mr. Hocker talking to someone and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mate was answered by a voice which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skipper, considering his present condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, knew only too well. It was the voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his betrothed--Rose Russell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Please don't bother, Mr. Hocker. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">run down and take him by surprise!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cap'n Bob had no chance to recover</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his amazement, for the next moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slim, willowy, brown-haired girl, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue eyes mirrored such a wealth of kindli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness that no one even noticed her nose was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little irregular, came bounding into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin. With a little gurgle of joy she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to throw herself into his arms when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she caught sight of the numerous patches</seg><seg type="columnLine">of court plaster on his face and his livid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swollen eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "O-h-h-h!" she gasped, recoiling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shudder. "Bob! Bob, what have you</seg><seg type="columnLine">been doing?" Recovering, she stepped up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him and laid a hand on his arm. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised me. Bob dear, that after that ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible battle with the champion, that you'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">never fight again!" she added in a voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mingled commiseration and dismay.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And now--" A tear glistened on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick lashes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--I don't think you'll blame me, Rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">dear," he stammered, "when you hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances.

"I've a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful surprise for you, dear, but I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">say no more till you tell me what hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened.

How he had merely followed the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">written law that a skipper must stand by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his officers under any and all circumstan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ces. Rose, knowing how dearly Cap'n Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved a fight, smiled to herself as she went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the rack against the mizzen mast and</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured a glass of water from the carafe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After drinking it she stood with one hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting on the table, a half-proud, half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitying look in her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," Cap'n Bob went on, "seems this</seg><seg type="columnLine">man is hurt pretty bad.

A moment later the rousta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bouts, dismissed for the day, streamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the gangplank and up the broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">levee toward the city.

The other in</seg><seg type="columnLine">many ways was an antithesis to the fiery</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain.

But behind the twinkle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an alert observer could have caught a touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of grimness. The tone of his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">strengthened the impression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That would be the ticket," he said, "if</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was an ordinary voyage.

You ain't forgot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have you. that this crook Blake has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">here all winter, cooking up a deal with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big banking crowd ?

Ever since reaching St. Louis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had heard tales of Blake and his opera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions on the upper Missouri--activities that</seg><seg type="columnLine">made even the toughest frontiersman shake</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head. And he had heard hints of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blake meant to do to Captain And)*, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as the Eagle got into wild country in</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CROSS AND DOUBLE CROSS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the spring.

"So for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this little dinner--you can go if you want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to, but I'm not setting foot off this packet</seg><seg type="columnLine">until she's well up the river.

Harker, following the direction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gaze, saw that a man had debouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one of the streets and was casting</seg><seg type="columnLine">about along the upper edge of the levee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently seeking some one of the many</seg><seg type="columnLine">boats. Suddenly alert, Harker watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger until Andy touched his arm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded toward the newcomer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Less'n I'm wrong," the captain said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that fellow is one of Blake's men.

Want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay a little bet?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harker, all thought of dinner gone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook his head. It had all seemed unreal</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him before, this talk of frontier feuds</seg><seg type="columnLine">and peaceful traders assailed by murder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But now this unreal thing had come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, was casting about, in the person of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this clerk, to commence the battle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the stranger, catching sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in the gloaming, waved his hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed for them. Arrived at the levee's</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge, he stood peering up at them as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">scanned him from the texas deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How are ye, Captain?" he called.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" 'Bout ready to pull out?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His tone and inquiry were friendly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harker thought, for an emissary of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy. But Andy was noncommittal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Bout ready as we're goin' to be, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckon," he called back, leaning both el-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bows on the rail. ''Anything I can do for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe," the other answered. "Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank's got something we'd like to go up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river, and seein's how you're pulling</seg><seg type="columnLine">out fi^st, we'd like to have you take it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Might l&gt;e all right," Andy replied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"providin' 'tain't too large.

"Not much more'n a carpetbag full.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How soon can we bring it on?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That news heightened Harker's alarm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A small shipment meant something special</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and anything special meant some scheme</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blake's, or so instinct whispered. Har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ker was glad the captain took time out be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore answering, though he wondered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">153</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">whether the answer, when it came, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sooner the better, I guess,'' vfas the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply. "Can you have it down right away</seg><seg type="columnLine">--or got it with you ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," the other responded, turning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave. "It's at the office. But they'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">it down in half an hour--soon's I can get</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and tell them. Much obliged to ye,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain, for helping us out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UCH obliged for noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing," Andy growled as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rail. For a moment his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough-hewn, ruddy</seg><seg type="columnLine">face showed worry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, to Harker's sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise, a smile flickered</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his lips, and was followed by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You look as if the British guinea'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to pewter," he said.

But I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering--don't you think it a bit risky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know, to take their bloody shipment?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Couldn't we save trouble by saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">no?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Andy's brows knit suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and an ominous spark flashed into his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he stared at Harker*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, we couldn't," he snapped. "Couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">let Blake think we're afraid of him, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">one tiling, or let the bank be telling around</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we were afraid to take a shipment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And if we blocked this dodge. Blake'd try</seg><seg type="columnLine">another; so we might as well lick him at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The grimness of his expression deep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened, as though at some sudden memory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he shrugged, and his touch of temper</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on," he said, "and see what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cook can do for us. Long as the trouble s</seg><seg type="columnLine">started, we might as well meet it as moan</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it, and you'll feel better for having</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good meal under the belt when they come</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Obediently Harker followed the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">below, and stood by while the steward</seg><seg type="columnLine">made things ready. Aside from a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">comments the meal was eaten in silence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in less than fifteen minutes they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">back on the texas deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was completely dark by now--the vei-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vety dark of a warm spring night, save</seg><seg type="columnLine">where lamps in uncurtained windows shone</seg><seg type="columnLine">like large yellow stars against the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">154</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">background of the town and surrounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiUs. Soft lapping of water against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">packet's side and distant bursts of laughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">from groggeries along the water's edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">punctuated, rather than relieved, the si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence. It was a night for happiness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy of living; but all Harker could feel in</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was the soft touch of intrigue and trou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble. More than once he thanked his stars</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the presence of the formidable cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain, dimly discernible as he leaned watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully against the rail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The suspense, however, was not pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed. Within ten minutes Captain Andy</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirred suddenly, paused an instant to lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten, then turned about. Suppressed ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citement rang in his tones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They've showed up," he said. "Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">on along and see what's what."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harker, his knees wobbling a bit now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the test had come, followed him down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forward stairway to the cabin deck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then down to the top of the hill, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cargo deck. Together they crossed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long gangplank to the levee, as footsteps</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded above. A moment later figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">loomed through the darkness--several of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The color of their garments made them</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible sooner than men wearing the cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomary black of that day would have been.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were clad in the blue-gray worn by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the regular army at the time; and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were bearing muskets with bayonets that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleamed dully in the night light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sodgers," Captain Andy muttered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harker.

A sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picious bulge beneath the visitor's cloak</seg><seg type="columnLine">strengthened the supposition. That would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the shipment--something small and</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, as the clerk had said it would be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the foot of the gangplank the cortege</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped, and the muffled man spoke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Captain Corbin?" he inquired. "I'm</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">here to come aboard-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come right along," Captain Andy an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered. "I haven't lit any lanterns, but we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have some inside. Go light up, will you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harker?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the word Harker departed for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin above, and the visitor set foot upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gangplank. An explosive sigh sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestive of relief escaped him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can hold your men there, Sergeant</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tompkins," he said, "until I return. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch that nobody comes aboard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir," came the answer from be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hind, in the tones of a well-drilled noncom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sound of musket butts rapping on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">levee, as Tompkins ordered, "Ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms," put a period to the answer. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">visitor turned to Captain Andy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "All right, Captain," he said. "Sorry to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be so late--but I'll tell you what it's all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about when we're aboard. Could we go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to your office?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure/' Andy said, and led the way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forward cabin on the deck above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cabin was a long room, entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the open space across the forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the deck, and flanked on either side</seg><seg type="columnLine">by cubby-hole staterooms. Harker had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled to light its lami&gt;s excq&gt;t at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">after end, where the bar stretched its</seg><seg type="columnLine">length across almost the entire room. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the bar a small opening had been cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the wall to give communication with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">room beyond. On the shelf in this open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was a small whale-oil lamp, glaring at</seg><seg type="columnLine">them like a smoky yellow eye staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the shadows. Harker was no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where to be seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the dim light Captain Andy could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">his visitor shudder a trifle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh!" he snorted, glancing swiftiy</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the cabin. "Your man has a saving</seg><seg type="columnLine">disposition. Captain, with the lights. Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">is he, anyway?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In his office there behind the bar,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy answered, nodding toward the open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with the lamp. "It's the only office we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have, so we'll go there. Come on through."</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the opening a narrow corridor ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther back toward the women's cabin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its after end lost in sooty darkness. A door</seg><seg type="columnLine">about six feet ahead, on the landward side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">emitted a block of yellow light to illum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ine the way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they reached the door Harker came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from inside the room, lifted the bar which</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocked entrance, and ushered them in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They took chairs and for a moment eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other without a word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE visitor was not of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the usual frontier type.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was a lean, hatchet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced man with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hawklike nose and cold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp eyes, somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">obscured by square-</seg><seg type="columnLine">framed glasses. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the night was warm, he kept his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloak clasped about his throat, and its dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">folds added to his ominous appearance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," he said, when the silence was</seg><seg type="columnLine">becoming noticeable, "my name's Townley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'm cashier of the Missouri and Kan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CROSS AND DOUBLE CROSS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sas Traders', on some business we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">with H.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose you're surprised at seeing me</seg><seg type="columnLine">here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are," Andy answered. "It's no</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret in these parts, Mr. Townley, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you wouldn't be here in usual course of</seg><seg type="columnLine">business, when Blake had anything to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it.^ So it's plain something queer is</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air, and were wondering what it is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Townley shot him a sharp glance, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinked behind his glasses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've heard you were a blunt man," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, 'and I can see why. But you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. There is something--something</seg><seg type="columnLine">we've never had to handle before--and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">need a good man to help. That's why we</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to you. Now I'll tell you all about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From beneath his cloak he drew a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin dispatch box, and set it on the table.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Both Harker and Captain Andy watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">him narrowly, waiting to hear what he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to propose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The whole thing is." he said, keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand on the dispatch box, "we've gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a railroad deal with Blake up in Iowa.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We're ready to go ahead now, and our man</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ground needs money--plenty of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So we've got to send it to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But we haven't been able to keep a deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">like this quiet, and a lot of people up Iowa</seg><seg type="columnLine">way know the money's coming. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">need to tell you what that means, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing the river as you do. It means</seg><seg type="columnLine">every gang in three states will be sniffing</seg><seg type="columnLine">around to get a crack at the money, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good man'll be needed to get the money</seg><seg type="columnLine">through. And you're the man, the way we</seg><seg type="columnLine">look at it, to do the job, if you'll take it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Andy's jaw set, and he stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfully at Townley in the lamplight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure we'll take it," he said, "and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">any gang gets the money, it'll be better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than any gang's been yet. How much is</seg><seg type="columnLine">it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Townley let a thin smile slip over his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the first evidence he had shown of hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man feelings--and drew the box nearer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. "Get ready for a surprise," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "I don't know about you," he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, with a glance at Harker, "seeing's how</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've come from a British bank. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Corbin here is going to see some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing he's never seen before--something</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's hardly been seen west of Washing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, if you ask my guess."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He threw open the lid of the box, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved his hand over its am tents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have a look," he said, "at half a mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion dollars in real money."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">155</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ALF a million! Silence</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fell in the stuffy little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cabin--silence as thick</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as the darkness that lay</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on the night-shrouded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">river--while they stared</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the crisp yellow bills,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">twinkling up at them in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the lamplight. They could hear each other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">breathing, hear the ticking of Captain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Andy's watch, and the lazy lapping of wa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ter against the Eagle's sides. Half a mil-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lion ! No wonder the gangs would be gath-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ering, Harker thought. And no wonder a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">good man would be needed to get the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">money through!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Captain Andy broke the spell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well," he said, "it's a sight of money,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but we'll handle it. So we might as well</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">count it in. Are you ready?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Townley smiled again and took up a slip</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">i of paper that lay on top of the money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "All set," he said. "Here's a tally"--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">handing the slip to Harker---"and you can</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">check off the amounts as I hand the money</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to Captain Corbin. I see you have a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strongbox that will do. And here's ten</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thousand in treasury hundreds to start."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The counting proceeded monotonously,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with Captain Andy inspecting each packet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">carefully, both as to amount and character</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of bill--a necessary' precaution at the time,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when private bank notes of various degrees</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of worthlessness still filled the country. As</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he placed the packets in ..ae strong box,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Harker checked off the sum, until all had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been counted over. Then Townley handed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Captain Andy a duplicate of the tally, to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sign a receipt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As he dipped pen in ink, Andy glanced</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sternly at the cashier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'm taking this," he said, "like ordinary</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cargo--due care and diligence, but no in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">demnity or warranty of special care. If</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you don't like that, you can take the money</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Townley waved his hand in an expansive</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gesture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Your due care and diligence, Captain,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are enough for us. As for indemnity, we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have insurance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He took the receipt, placed it carefully</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in his wallet, and rose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Just one thing more. Captain. You're</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">going through wild country, and you're go-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing to have a hard time getting through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when it's known you have this much money</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with you. So we arranged with the com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mander of the St. Louis garrison to send a</seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">detachment of soldiers along, if you want</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. They're the men below, and they'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">report to you if you want them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure thing/' said the captain. "We'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull through without them, but I'm not one</seg><seg type="columnLine">to turn down help. Send them up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right/1 Townley said, and drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">some papers from an inside pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">, "Here's a letter to you from the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manding officer, and a copy of the orders</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gave them, so you'll know how you</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand with them. And that, 1 guess, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He closed his dispatch box, replaced it</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath his cloak, and held out liis hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Good-by, Captain," he said. "And good</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck with the job."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Captain Andy shook hands gingerly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Townley left. Andy listened until the vis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itor was safely out of the forward cabin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then slapped his hand down heavily on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong box.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," he demanded, "what do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">make of it ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harker looked helplessly from Andy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the money and back again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I can't make head or tail of it!" he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessed. "They're up to no good, I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose. Yet this chap Townley was fair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken enough, and this military escort</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks like honest help. Perhaps they really</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">want us to take this money to Iowa-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh!" Andy snorted, and there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">somber glow in his eyes as he stared from</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath lowered brows at Harker. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank's square, like enough; but that don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">count when this skate Blake's mixed up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deal. Its just his way to line up some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing respectable, then hit at you from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of it. He's using the half million</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's talked out of this bank to bait a trap</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some kind, and don't you think nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">else. And with that amount of money</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard the trip'll be a record breaker, or I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know the Missouri.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">•"So let's get these soldiers aboard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grab some sleep while we have the chance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'll be needing clear heads, if ever they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were needed, commencing at daylight to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow morning!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T NINE o'clock next</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning the roust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abouts carried the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">bales of belated mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chandise alx&gt;ard and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posited them upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad, open cargo deck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A few passengers who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lingered in the warm sunshine pouring</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ujjon the levee hastened aboard. Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy turned from the port rail of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lexas deck and addressed the first mate--</seg><seg type="columnLine">formally, since this was an occasion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceremony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Guess you can cast off now, Mr. Smith.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seems as how we're ready."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smith stalked forward to execute the</seg><seg type="columnLine">order, and Andy rq^laced his elbows on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rail. It was his invariable custom on</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving a landing to wait in that spot on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landward side, watching everyone and</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything that came aboard, and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubly careful now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A stentorian l&gt;ellow sounded forward--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Smith getting the crew into action.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mooring lines were cast off, and the gang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plank started to swing in. In another mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment the Eagle would have been under</seg><seg type="columnLine">way; but a shout rang from the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">levee edge and some belated passengers ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared--three of them, two men and a wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Captain Andy roared an order; the sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond mate in the pilot house rang the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gines to stop; and Smith on the cargo deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">let the gangplank stay outboard. The pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sengers scrambled aboard; and the packet</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a second start. The huge red paddle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels creaked, then began to slap the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud-stained waters in steady rhythm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Obediently the Eagle slipped from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">levee into midstream, first boat of the 1840</seg><seg type="columnLine">season to leave St. Louis for Independence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fairport. and the upper Missouri.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Captain Andy turned from the rail, puz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zlement over the belated passengers in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. He had recognized all three. One,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from long and unpleasant contact in St.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louis and on the river, he knew to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pittsburgh Jake, a black-hatted, frock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coated bully and cheap gambler who rated</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the worst of the many that infested</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river waters. The others, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned when they engaged passage, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a farm couple, bent and worn from long</seg><seg type="columnLine">years on the Ohio soil, going to what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped would be kindlier life in Kansas. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">more ill-assorted company could hardly be</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagined.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But that wasn't the root of Andy's won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derment. When they had appeared, Jake</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been sharing the baggage-carrying with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man, and helping the woman along;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he had continued to do so until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were aboard. It was the decent thing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do, of course, and the tiling most men</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have done. But it was the first time</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy ever had known, or heard, of Jake</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing the decent thing. Clearly the leopard</seg><seg type="columnLine">was changing his spots, unless-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CROSS AXD DOUBLE CROSS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's something back of it." he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tiimself. "Never knew Jake to act like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that before. Looks like I'd better be keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing my eyes on all three of them. It's sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting to be a complicated trip."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sudden burst of hot words on the deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">below testified to yet another of the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plications. As though the money, and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">the question of Jake and his associates,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not enough, the shout evidenced trou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble 011 another score. Although in politics</seg><seg type="columnLine">the twenty-year-old Missouri Compromise</seg><seg type="columnLine">had quieted the slavery question, the Mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">souri River country had not shared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace. The "popular sovereignty" doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trine, which later was to drench Kansas</seg><seg type="columnLine">with blood, had not yet been invented; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">even so, the free-soilers and slavery men</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling the river were increasingly bitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward each other. A little whisky, a taunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two, and there was sure to be a fight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Captain Andy, from the looks of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd aboard, knew that he had a choice</seg><seg type="columnLine">cargo of trouble in this respect--trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">that might even now be starting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the quarrel below died down as</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly as it had started--so he started his</seg><seg type="columnLine">customary tour of inspection. First came</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspection of the cargo, the boilers, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines; then the time-lionored ceremony</seg><seg type="columnLine">of selecting the best deckhand by the sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple expedient of letting aspirants for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">honor fight it out. That done, he under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">took what would be the real inspection for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this trip--examination of the passenger</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters and a look-see at the passengers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first glance everything seemed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order, as much as a packet load of trap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pers, plainsmen, settlers and gamblers</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be expected to be in order. The few</seg><seg type="columnLine">married couples aboard had retreated</seg><seg type="columnLine">discreetly to the women's cabin in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the after portion of the boat. Many</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the quieter sort among the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">had disposed themselves in favorable spots</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the little passageway running around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabins, and were watching the monot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onous procession of hills, trees and muddy</seg><seg type="columnLine">farms that slipped to the rear as the Eagle</seg><seg type="columnLine">chugged and plopped up-stream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet there were signs of trouble, exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it might be expected--among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">free lances gathered in the forward cabin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">handy to the bar. As he passed through,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy noticed that Jake and one or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">others of the gamblers had started little</seg><seg type="columnLine">games; and he noWbed something ominous</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Jake's conduct. For once Jake's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind was not on the cards. He was keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing one ear cocked to hear the talk at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar ; ami the talk did not promise peace for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">157</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the balance of the voyage. Two or three</seg><seg type="columnLine">times Andy caught the sure catchwords of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble--"free soil" and "states' rights."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jake's erstwhile companion, the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">farmer, was an active talker in a group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">free-soil men. The chances looked excel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent for trouble within an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Andy, however, merely shrug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ged. That was all part of the business,</seg><seg type="columnLine">something every Missouri River captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced, just as he faced the snags and sand</seg><seg type="columnLine">bars of the river. He had more important</seg><seg type="columnLine">cares this trip, and it was time he was see-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to them--commencing with a visit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his reinforcements, the soldiers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Because of the Eagle's reputation for</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability to take care of herself, he had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided the night before to keep Tompkins</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his men out of sight unless absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed. Therefore he had turned his cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to them, with orders to keep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinds drawn, keep quiet, and not stir out</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless summoned. So he climbed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">texas deck, and started for his cabin abaft</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wheelhouse to see how they were stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the drastic regimen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the visit was not made. As he laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand on the door knob, a burst of brutal</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter rang out below, and a light foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">step sounded on the deck behind him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">whipped around, only to recoil hastily. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">newcomer was a woman, the very one Jake</seg><seg type="columnLine">had helped aboard, and she was visibly per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbed. Her face was working beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">her sunbonnet, and she was wringing her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands under cover of her shawl. Evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble for the voyage had begun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">APT AIN ANDY whip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped off his cap, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped toward her. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same moment an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other laugh rang out</seg><seg type="columnLine">below--with an uglier</seg><seg type="columnLine">quality this time. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">started at the sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her terror deepened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the matter, ma'am?" Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy asked, patting her on the arm. "Are</seg><seg type="columnLine">they too rough for you below? You</seg><seg type="columnLine">mustn't mind a little shouting and singing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't," she answered in a choking</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. "But you must come, Captain. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">my poor Thomas--my husband--and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they're--they're picking on him-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Andy choked back a curse. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">he remembered correctly her husband was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mean-spirited little runt, just the sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crowd of river toughs would pick on for</seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">amusement. Still, here was his wife, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was distressed about it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still another stentorian laugh rang out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from below--one with ihe ugliest quality</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all. At the sound Andy jumped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you worry, ma'am," he called,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and darted for the stairs. Three ape-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumps, with his huge hands and long arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging him along on the stair-rails,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him to the cabin deck, and he scut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tled in to the forward saloon. For a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment his eyes, accustomed to the clean,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright air of the texas deck, saw nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the haze of tobacco smoke that ed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">died and billowed inside the cabin, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers milled about in it. Then his vi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion cleared, and he saw the trouble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a break in the crowd, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the break was the little farmer. And Jake's</seg><seg type="columnLine">game, started earlier in the morning, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken up--for the little fanner was held</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the collar almost clear of the floor by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jake himself, a giant in comparison. Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">questionably, events had moved quickly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the few minutes Andy had been away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that moment Jake shook his erst-</seg><seg type="columnLine">while companion with one hand, and took</seg><seg type="columnLine">a glass of whisky from the bar with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you're a temperance man, are you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he roared. "Well, it's time you drank to</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you believe, so put it down like a lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle man. Come on now--one, two-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the "three" was never uttered. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">long arm swept up between him and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little man, breaking his grip. Then a red</seg><seg type="columnLine">and club-like fist hit him once, square on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the point of the chin. He spun back against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowd, grabbed for the bar, missed it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slumped to a sitting posture on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. From there he stared upward, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes spinning oddly, at the figure tower-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, you don't," growled Andy from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the depths of his barrel-like chest, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed on two short legs tliat bowed out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, as though they had given way some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what beneath the weight of his massive</seg><seg type="columnLine">torso. "Not on the Eagle, anyhow. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">tend to your business, and let this man tend</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his. Get that plain ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waved a fist in front of the other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose, then turned to the little man. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had learned nothing of the right and wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the affair, but he knew the tiling to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">right now. He must get the combatants</seg><seg type="columnLine">separated and give them time to cool down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of sight of each other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on," he said to the little chap.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Your wife's waiting for you on the texas</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck. Better come with me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Goin' to join the ladies!" came a mock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing call from the crowd. It stopped short</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Andy whirled about. Thereafter the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd was silent, while he piloted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge to the cabin door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'd better stay on the texas deck a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while," he said. "Here, Sam!" he called</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a nearby deckhand. "Take this gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man above, and see that he and his wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">have chairs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Content to dismiss the matter at that, lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">slapped the little fanner on the back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned away. But the farmer did not ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept the dismissal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cap'n," he said, and stopped. Andy</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheeled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ■'Yes?" he queried, impatient to l&gt;e gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't bother with any thanks. It's all in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the job, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Tain't that," said the other, "though</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm sure grateful. But seein's how you</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped me, I thought I'd help you. There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble cornin' for this boat--trouble I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know about--and I want to tell you what</seg><seg type="columnLine">it ft "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Andy's impatience vanished in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly. This might be news that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">point the way through all the Eagle's trou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bles. All other business could wait on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospect of learning anything like that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Trouble coming, you say!" he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed. "What kind of trouble?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little man answered Yankee-fashion</seg><seg type="columnLine">--with another question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ever hear tell of the Turnbulls?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Turnbulls!'' Captain Andy echoed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other needn't have asked if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard. He had, all too often. So had all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other river men, and the United States</seg><seg type="columnLine">Government, and the perplexed govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the state. The Turnbulls were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most noted band of desperadoes west of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Mississippi at that time, and their ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ritory one hundred and fifty miles up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river was shunned as though afflicted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plague, so ruthless had been their oper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And mention of their name almost made</seg><seg type="columnLine">further information about the nature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trouble superfluous. If the Turnbulls</seg><seg type="columnLine">were concerned, Captain Andy knew just</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the Eagle might expect, and about</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the blow would fall. The thing worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing would be any details the little fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low might know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I've heard of them," Andy an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered grimly. "What about them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little man's face twisted into a sar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">donic smile, and a gleam came into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CROSS AND DOUBLE CROSS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, it's this way," he replied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's some of their men on board, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think, and I heard them talking. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jake's one of them. And when you get</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in the Turnbull country, these men</seg><seg type="columnLine">are goin' to jump you, and the rest is corn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in' aboard. You're goin5 to be raided.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's what it is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Raided! Well, that was what he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected, Captain Andy told himself. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">how did this little fellow know about it--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and what more did he know? Could it be</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was betraying confidences reposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in him by Jake before they came aboard?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He seized the other's arm in an eager grip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What else?'' he demanded. "Who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">it you heard talking--and where?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't see 'em/' he answered. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">was around a corner over there." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to the narrow gangway, leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">aft outside the starboard cabins. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought I knew that big brute's voice when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he picked on me. I don't know no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than I told you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as he said it, Andy suddenly caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason to doubt the statements. During the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief colloquy the little man's shiftiness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his way of glancing sidewise at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, had tended to confirm the captain's</seg><seg type="columnLine">low estimate of him. But now, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">making his denial, he came through with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance as steely and straight as a rifle bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rel. Evidently he was not the weakling</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had seemed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Plainly, too, his denial of further knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge was false, else why should he have re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed himself in his anxiety to know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">the statement w^as received ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still, if he chose to stop there, Andy saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">no way of making him go on. Not now, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">any rate. So he asked an aimless question</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two, then thanked the other and gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. The farmer started for the texas deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Captain Andy, anxious to turn over</seg><seg type="columnLine">this strange new turn of affairs in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, started to follow. But with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other there, his favorite nook at the port</seg><seg type="columnLine">rail would be untenable, he reflected sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly; so as second choice he started for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harker's cabi**..</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE awed crowd parted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yielding him a clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage to the purser's</seg><seg type="columnLine">office, and he entered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shutting the door be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ll	i n d him. Harker,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whose reddened, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiring face showed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effects of a busy morning, looked up with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">159</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm that turned to relief as he recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized his visitor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's you!" he exclaimed. "I'm jolly</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad, after all that's happened. Looked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me like you'd get killed if you kept on like</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were going."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean-?" Andy asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Been worrying 'cause I calmed down that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow Jake a while ago, when he was pick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on the little fanner ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The fanner Oatsby? Partly that. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't see where Oatsby was worth wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rying about. Wby didn't you let them</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't have that sort of doings on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eagle, for one thing," Andy explained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And for another, it let me in on some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing I wouldn't have known otherwise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You'll agree it was worth a fight when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear what this fellow--Oatsby, you said</seg><seg type="columnLine">his name was--told me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Briefly he repeated Oatsby's news, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough in addition to make the situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear. The way Harker's jaw dropped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the color drained from his face told elo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quently enough what he thought. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he said nothing. Then speech</seg><seg type="columnLine">came with a rush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But these Turnbulls! Where'll we run</seg><seg type="columnLine">into them, and what are they like?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Andy grinned, though with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of battle in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, they're the toughest gang this</seg><seg type="columnLine">country has ever seen, and they work about</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred miles up the river from here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So we'll run into them first tiling tomorrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, less'n the Eagle hits a snag or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandbar between here and there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Lord !'* Harker exclaimed. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't give us much time to get ready for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. What are we going to do about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That." drawled Andy, seating himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"is what I came to talk about. And I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking, 'stead of deciding, 'cause this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm up a tree."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused, drumming his fingers on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair arm, while Harker stared. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If it was just the Turnbulls," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I wouldn't worry two minutes 'bout it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If we couldn't lick them, we'd deserve</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever happened. Jake and his gang</seg><seg type="columnLine">make it more troublesome; but I could fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure to handle them same time as the Turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulls. But it sticks in my mind that we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have more than that to worry about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That shipment of money there--" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded at the strongbox--"is what gets</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I can't see where it comes in, yet I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">bet it's at the bottom of everything."</seg><seg type="columnLine">i6o</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course it is," Harker broke in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The reason for it's plain enough, seems to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. It's bait to draw trouble, and 'pon my</seg><seg type="columnLine">word, it's been successful! And the bank's</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the loser if the Turnbulls get it. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">chap Tovvnley said it was insured. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blake wouldn't have trouble talking them</seg><seg type="columnLine">into shipping it by the Eagle, where it'd be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure to make trouble for us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Andy shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't know Blake," he replied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's been a tough operator for the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten years, and he hasn't done anything by</seg><seg type="columnLine">halves yet. He might ship the money by</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to cause us trouble, but he'd go on and</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrange the trouble, too. Likewise he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">have more'n a plain gang fight hi his</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme, less'n he's changed his ways.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, there's something more to it, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing we don't see at all. And it's my</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess the trouble'll pop right when we're in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle of things with the Turnbulls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Another thing I don't like is this fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low Oatsby and his fight with Jake. Maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">I didn't tell you; but when they came on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat, they were thick as thieves. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour later we find them fighting--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on top of that Oatsby lets out all he knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">'bout Jake. Looks funny to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I _ don't see why," Harker returned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Their failin' out is natural enough, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">rnffiians of that stamp. And after they</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell out, why shouldn't a little rat like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oatsby revenge himself by telling all he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because he isn't a rat of that sort,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy declared roundly. "He's got nerve</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to fight his own battles, if I'm any</seg><seg type="columnLine">judge of human nature. He wouldn't run</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling stories without he had a reason.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, it's a tangle, if there ever was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one--what's that?" the captain demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pointed to a banknote lying on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table beside the strongbox. Harker handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's counterfeit, I believe," he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained. "This fellow Jake paid it over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar and I'm not sure--you have so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">banknotes in this country--but it doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">look right to me. So I held it out to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you thought of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">^ Captain Andy took the bill and scanned</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. It was a ten-dollar note, issued by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ohio bank, and a moment's inspection con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmed Harker's opinion of it. The erratic</seg><seg type="columnLine">workmanship left no doubt that the bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">was counterfeit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But if Jake had passed one counterfeit</seg><seg type="columnLine">--acting^ upon a sudden idea Andy rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the strong box, demanded the key from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Harker. and scrutinized the money. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, his idea had to be abandoned as</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly as it had come. Unquestionably</seg><seg type="columnLine">the money in the box was genuine. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made no mistake the night before on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">score.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then on the heels of the discarded no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, came another--a bizarre, fantastic no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. But as Andy tested it against every</seg><seg type="columnLine">question that had troubled him, one by one</seg><seg type="columnLine">it answered them. So far as he could see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the riddle bad been read !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I bet I've got it!" he explained. "I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got what Blake's up to now--and he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">never hatched anything better, I can tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you! The Turnbulls ain't more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">starter in the scheme. If we hadn't seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it he'd have had us nailed, even if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we killed every Turnbull in the lot!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pie all but capered in his excitement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Harker looked increasingly blank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But see here!" the bewildered purser</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded. "I can't follow you at all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What is the bally scheme, now that you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed it ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Relief over seeing his way clear through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tangle of troubles ahead had sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy's spirits skyhigh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, it's plain as daylight!" he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied. "Just put together everything that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened, and you can't miss it. Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you get the idea?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, 'pon my word I don't," Harker</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped. "If you know what they're up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to, why keep it a confounded secret? Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">not out with it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Andy laughed. Harker's angry</seg><seg type="columnLine">impatience made the temptation to tease ir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistible. He glanced at his watch, let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting Harker wait, then rose leisurely to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I tell you what I'll do." he said. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly noon now, and there ain't time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain before we cat. But I'll do better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than tell you. I'll show you--either in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next half hour or 'bout supper time--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll bet ten dollars that you'll see their</seg><seg type="columnLine">game without my saying a word. Is it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">go?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ten dollar;;--two pounds--of course!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the purser agreed. It will be worth that to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">know what's what. But-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind," said Andy. "There's ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars up, and I've got to get ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">scoop it in, so I'll be off to get things</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">started. Just one thing-" He stopped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">at the door as he said this, and was sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly serious. "Don't leave this office for</seg><seg type="columnLine">any reason--any reason, not if the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes fire--till I come back, even if I stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">all afternoon. Likewise don't be surprised</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CROSS AND DOUBLE CROSS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">at what happens overhead in llie next half</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour. And last of all--" his gaiety re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned again--"you can kiss your ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">gooy-by, 'cause it's mine or I'm the big-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gest liar that ever navigated the Missouri,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is saying plenty!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">S ANDY made his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin, where the stew-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ards were finishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparations for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">noonday meal amidst</seg><seg type="columnLine">the press of drinkers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his solution of Blake's</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme looked better and better to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Likewise he saw7 now exactly what to do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">provided his notion was verified on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">point, the point he had engaged to settle</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Harker's ten as a premium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was another difficulty--that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting Tompkins, the non-commissioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer, to fall in with his plan. From what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had seen of Tompkins, however, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised to be easy. The other question</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained the important one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First he sought the Eagle's carpenter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and procured a brace and bit. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to his cabin on the texas deck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked on the door, and entered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first glance after entering, it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the cabin was empty. Then in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">half light that was all the carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">screened windows would admit lie descried</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tompkins and his men. Like soldiers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all times and lands, they believed in resting</seg><seg type="columnLine">whenever possible. Two were sprawled on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy's bed. Tompkins had the couch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The others had unrolled their blankets on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor and were lying on them. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the muskets, gleaming dully from where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were stacked against the wall, showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">readiness for trouble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Andy looked, Tompkins rose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Any trouble, Captain?" he inquired.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If there is, you can lead us to it. We're</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired of sticking around doing nothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looks like you're tired," Andy com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented dryly, as tl^ee or four heads pop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped up seal-like from the blankets. "No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there ain't any trouble--yet. I just drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped in to see how you were getting on, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">do a little work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The heads dropped back again on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blankets. But Tompkins descried the brace</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bit, and his expression lightened with</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''What'5 the borer for?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Making repairs, or is that part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">game ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll see." Andy returned, as he esti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mated a distance on the floor. His cabin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew, as directly over Harker's office,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he wanted to pick a spot immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">over an inner corner of the space below.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Selecting the proper spot, he began to bore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the soldiers crowded around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's doing now?" one of the livelier</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirits queried. "Who are you looking in</seg><seg type="columnLine">on--or are you going to take a pot shot at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That," Andy muttered, "depends on</seg><seg type="columnLine">what happens. But you're talking too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much. There's passengers hanging around</seg><seg type="columnLine">on deck outside, and I don't want them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men fell back, and Andy nodded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tompkins to draw close. The non-commis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sioned officer came and knelt beside him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want to ask you, Sergeant," Andy</seg><seg type="columnLine">said in a low tone, "have you ever heard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Turnbull gang?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tompkins' face hardened swiftly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say!" he exclaimed. "That gang has</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked off two of my pals now, different</seg><seg type="columnLine">times we was taking trains through their</seg><seg type="columnLine">country. I've heard of them all right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why, are they fixing to make trouble for</seg><seg type="columnLine">us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Andy exulted. This was even</seg><seg type="columnLine">better than he had hoped. With Tompkins</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing a grudge against the Turnbulls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">winning him to his plans would be easy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, they are," he said. "But seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I know about it in advance, I think if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll help, we can fix them so it'll be their</seg><seg type="columnLine">last trouble making for quite a while."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can you !" Tompkins exclaimed. "Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">say what you want, then. We're with you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get them, any way you think'll work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">_ "That's great; Now I'll tell you my no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. First, we could just beat the Turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulls off, if we were willing to let it go at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. But then they'd just go back into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods, and be all ready to raise Ned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next time they saw a chance. If we want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to finish them we've got to get behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them--cut off their retreat and corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tompkins' eyes lighted with understand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right," he said. "And we'll cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner them right while they're raiding--no</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to argue with the judge about any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. I get your idea, all right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Andy's smile broadened. Tompkins was</seg><seg type="columnLine">proving admirable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm glad you see it that way," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"So I'll tell you my scheme, and I'll bet</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll like it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's how I figure it out. The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop I've got in Turnbull country is at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spring Landing early tomorrow morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so thafs'where I think they'll try to hit us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Probably they shipped the .stuff I've got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, to make sure i'd put in. And that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">where we'll have to get them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To do that, I figure I'd better put you</seg><seg type="columnLine">off, soon as we tie up for the night, a tew</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles this side of the landing. H you</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know, we never run at night on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Missouri. The channel shifts too much,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and has too many snags. Then you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">work along the river, and hide in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushes behind the landing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You'll find a sort of blufT, with a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">underbrush on it, 'bout thirty yards behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landing. There's a store there, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little dock they've built, so you can't miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place. You can lay in the brush till we</seg><seg type="columnLine">show up, and the Tuwibulls come down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landing. Then when we fire from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat, you can jump them from behind, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we've got them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bit lunged forward at that moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and captain ,\ndy withdrew it from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">completed hole. Peering through, he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harker staring upward in astonishment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also he made sure he could see the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the shelf where the strong box was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Satisfied, he stood up and addressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tompkins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, what do you say to it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It's all fine,'' Tompkins said, "and we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it. But just one thing. What if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">jump you tonight, while vou're tied</seg><seg type="columnLine">up?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> MI don't think they will. They like to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work on horseback, and where I'll tie up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they couldn't get a horse within half a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us. But if they should try--well, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can leave that to me. Satisfactory?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes,'' Tompkins replied. "I've heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">about you, and I know you can handle</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Now what's this for, and what'll we</seg><seg type="columnLine">do about it ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pointed to the newly bored hole.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Andy considered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," he answered, "I can't tell ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">actly what there'll be to see, but I've got a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunch. So if you want something to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">this afternoon, you might have your men</seg><seg type="columnLine">take turns watching and see that nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">happens to Harker. I don't think there'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be anything doing, though, till 'bout sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">set. I'll be back then, and we'll see if I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. Suit you ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tompkins held out his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a deal," he said, "and we'll put ft</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">over."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UNSET found the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">.plop-plop ping her way</seg><seg type="columnLine">along a desolate, bluff-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bordered stretch of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tawny river a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred miles above St.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Loui6, seeking a favor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able spot in which to tie</seg><seg type="columnLine">up for the night. A mile or so ahead Andy</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected to reach an island that would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">just right, provided the breakup of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winter ice and the spring llooas hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">washed it away or screened it with a bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rier of snags. Failing the island, any spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which Tompkins could get on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north shore, and which couldn't be reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a ship, would do. For all his con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidence in the Engle's ability to lake care</seg><seg type="columnLine">of herself, Andy had no intention of risk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ink a surprise attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Eagle rounded a turn in the river,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the island came into sight. From his</seg><seg type="columnLine">post inside the wheelhouse, he smiled as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">scanned it. For once the Missouri had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been kind. The island was accessible and</seg><seg type="columnLine">suitable in every way lor a stop. He turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Smith, the first mate, who was standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">near.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Youcan make your landing there," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, pointing, "and get out a wood gang.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Better lay in enough to last all day tomor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row. Wre may not get any at Spring Land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had not told the mate about the raid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there was no need as yet. It was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual on the river, when not in Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, to lay in a day's supply of wood</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the boilers at the night stop, and save</seg><seg type="columnLine">the daylight hours for running. The mate</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore merely nodded, and continued to</seg><seg type="columnLine">scan the surface of the water for the tell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tale ripples that warned of new mud bars</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hidden snags.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a last look ahead, Andy left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel and made his way toward Harker's</seg><seg type="columnLine">office. During the afternoon the forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin, he could see, had become a sample</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the frontier at its wildest The air was</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue with smoke, which filled the space</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost to the occlusion of vision. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bar was a milling crowd, growing nois-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ier and more obstreperous every minute, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fast-flowing whisky fed their tempers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Recklessness was in the air in explosive</seg><seg type="columnLine">quantity, ready to break out into mischief</seg><seg type="columnLine">on any excuse or no excuse at all. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning fear of him had gone, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to work his way through as best he</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CROSS AND DOUBLE CROSS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could, catching murmurs of heated talk at</seg><seg type="columnLine">every step.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harker, who had remained in his stuffy</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters continuously save when Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy had spelled him for the noonday</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal, exhibited heartfelt relief at the skip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per's entrance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope," he said, "you'll let me out for</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a bit of a turn about the deck before</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunset. I'd like to catch a breath of air</seg><seg type="columnLine">and see a bit of the country, you know."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Andy laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll see all you want and then some</seg><seg type="columnLine">before we reach the Dakotas," he retorted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's time now that we settled about your</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten dollars. Before we go, though, have</seg><seg type="columnLine">you seen anything more of Oatsby?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harker's face clouded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes." he answered slowly, "and he's up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to devilment of some sort, I'll warrant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's thick as thieves with a crowd of pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sengers, chaps of the free soil party, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they've been hooting at Jake and his crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">all afternoon. I've been watching them</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the window there, and several</seg><seg type="columnLine">times I thought a row would start. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a nice mess, wouldn't it, along</seg><seg type="columnLine">with our other worries ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Andy nodded. A fight, in it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, he didn't mind much. What he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen coming through the cabin made that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainty within a few hours, anyway. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Oatsby and Jake in it, the trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be started whenever it suited their</seg><seg type="columnLine">needs. That would prove awkward, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">undoubtedly the trouble would start when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he should be paying attention to the money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, nothing could be done about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it; so he nodded and rose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," it would be a mess," he agreed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and a worse one than you think. But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">all fits in with-my notion of what they're</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to, so we might as well stick to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme we have--beginning with raking in</seg><seg type="columnLine">your ten dollars. This, I think, is the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do it, so you'd better close your office</seg><seg type="columnLine">and come along."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harker obeyed with alacrity, putting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little office into order in a trice. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepping out and closing the door, he drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">his key, snorting with disgust as he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What a toy to turn on that money," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">grumbled. "If only you had one of those</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">good new Bramah locks, now-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How'd you feci," Captain Andy broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, "if I told you Blake's bank owned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eagle once, and probably Blake's hooked a</seg><seg type="columnLine">duplicate of that key from them? Oh, it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right," he added hurriedly, as Harker</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned a surprised face up from his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">163</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stooped position. "If I didn't think he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, I wouldn't have guessed his scheme, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wouldn't be able to win your money.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now come along and watch me do it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On re-entering the forward cabin, Andy</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked about but without success, to locate</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jake and Oatsby. In the confusion noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing short of a detailed search would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved whether or not they were there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neither was it worth stopping for; so</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy piloted Harker to his cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I guess you know Mr. Harker," he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soldiers by way of introduction. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to, if you've been watching all after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure we know him," one of the soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">chirruped.

But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't think you'd see anything till now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And maybe even now we'll be disappointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But in that he was proved a false</seg><seg type="columnLine">prophet. Almost before the words had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mouth an angry shout rang out below</seg><seg type="columnLine">--then another, and still another, until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">blended into a muffled roar. Sounds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">splintering wood became audible; and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the deck everyone in the group</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear the rush and surge of bodies in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forward cabin. Evidently the moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had left, Jake or Oatsby or somebody</seg><seg type="columnLine">had touched the proverbial match to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive situation, and pandemonium had</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken loose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stand fast!" Andy bellowed, as several</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the soldiers reached for their muskets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's a trick--I'll tend to it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You, Harker, watch that hole as if your</seg><seg type="columnLine">life depended on it.

But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgot his chagrin the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin below and took in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scene. A confused</seg><seg type="columnLine">free-for-all was in progress, wrapped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">billowing smoke. The cabin lamps, shed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ding their smoky yellow light upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene, were growing fewer, as one after</seg><seg type="columnLine">another was knocked from its stand or</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed bv a flying missile. The shouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">164</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and imprecations told that, the pro- and</seg><seg type="columnLine">anti-slavery feeling had broken loose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second mate, coming from behind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jostled Andy and pointed to the forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck, where the crew was massing,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "We're all here," he shouted above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">din. "What'll we do now ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Get 'em inside the door and in a dou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble Hue," Andy barked as he forced his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way inward from the door. A few lunges</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blows cleared a space, and the crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">jammed in. Forcing their way, they mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaled themselves as directed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now sweep 'em!" Andy roared, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started for the bar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was tough going, every inch of it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a case of dealing with eacn opponent man</seg><seg type="columnLine">to man. Obstreperous ones Andy floored</seg><seg type="columnLine">when there was room to swing on them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Others he pushed headlong into the melee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bowl over still others. The more peace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, or those of flagging energy, he seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flung behind his line of helpers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Twice a chair swung through the air at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head. Once he ducked. The second</seg><seg type="columnLine">time the chair caught him a glancing blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one of its rungs. He bellowed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged into the crowd after the man he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought had thrown it. Catching him, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled him against one, then another, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rioters nearby, until he had cleared a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring; then let the man, unconscious by</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, slump to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  That ended the rioting. Several of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew burst pell-mell into the opening, en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larged it, and soon had all the combatants</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed against one or another of the walls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That done, the sailors stood watching their</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners and aw'aiting orders, while Andy</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced about appraising the situation. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">now that the fight was over he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">again of his responsibilities on the texas</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Damn!" he exclaimed, and beckoned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second mate. "Chase them all to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cargo," he directed, with a sweeping ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture toward the rioters, "and keep them</seg><seg type="columnLine">there until you get this in order. I'll send</seg><seg type="columnLine">word what I want you to do next in a min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute or two."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  With a dismal certainty that under cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the riot Blake's men had put something</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, he scuttled back to his cabin. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">words were needed to tell him that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fears were justified. The evident con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sternation of Harker and Tompkins was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ample testimony to that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, what's happened?" he demanded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as both started to talk at once and failed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Something's gone wrong, I'll bet a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe,1' Tompkins said, as Harker</seg><seg type="columnLine">sputtered, "and maybe not. Go on, tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">him!" he continued, jogging Harker. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw it. I didn't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why--why--" Harker began, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped. But the sound of his voice proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadying, and after a moment his story</seg><seg type="columnLine">came with a rush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was watching there while the riot was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going on, when the door to my office</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">opened, and somebody whipped in-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Somebody!

Andy barked. The hood</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something he hadn't counted on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it didn't matter much. If the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">did as he expected, he could find him</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly enough. "Get your breath and let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">have it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why--" Harker's eyes were hollow</seg><seg type="columnLine">with despair nowr--"he blew out the light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that's all we saw!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Blew out the light--" Andy echoed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then stopped as the full force of the news</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All his plans, his preparations, his hopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">for confirming his notion of Blake's</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme, had been blasted by this one action.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had been defeated by the simplest ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedient possible!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well of all the damned lummoxes--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he commenced, then stopped again. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard to believe that he had overlooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything so simple, that he could have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">so stupid. Then he pulled himself to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether. There was no use in cry in g over</seg><seg type="columnLine">spilled milk now. He might better be do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing something to retrieve the situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, Harker," he exclaimed, start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for the door. "Let's see what we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">see now, anyway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His first fear he discovered was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">founded. The strongbox was still on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelf, lock in place and apparently in order.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's see how it is inside," Andy com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded, and Harker. applying his key,</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw up the lid. As it opened, Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy could see that the box was filled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Under the full light which poured upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the contents when the lid was thrown back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything seemed in order.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank God!" Harker said. "Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">what do you suppose he was up to? Or do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you think he was scared off? Anyway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we're clear of trouble now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Andy was not listening. He picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up two or three packets of bills, scanned</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and replaced them. His brows were</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CROSS AND DOUBLE CROSS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">knitted and gloomy determination was in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his eyes when he faced the purser.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Instead of being safe," he said, "we're</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">worse off than ever! If he'd tampered with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the money it would have meant my guess</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at their scheme was right, and I'd have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">known just how to beat them. But he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">didn't--so now I'm up a tree higher'n ever</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about their scheme.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "And don't kid yourself he was scared</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">away. It's simply that their game runs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deeper than we think."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He extracted a roll of bills from his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pocket, peeled off a ten and handed it to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Harker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There you are," he said. "I'm beat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The only thing I can think of now is to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">watch everything that goes on, and hope</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we can move faster than they do.

And all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this while he was cursing to himself--curs-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing his foolhardiness, his cocksure folly in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deserting the money even for an instant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No fool like mi old fool," he told him-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">self as he concluded his patroling arrange-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ments.

For a mo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment,as he leaned elbows on the texas deck</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rail and let himself peer into the blackness</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">toward where he knew the north shore to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be, he let depression sweep over him. Then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he Bhook himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Never get anywhere by moping," he -</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">165</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">muttered. "Might as well be up and at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">'em. Plenty to do yet before it's time to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He sought his cabin, where the buoyant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spirit of the soldiers as they busied them-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">selves making final preparations, restored</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him to cheerfulness. Now that he was in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the dark as to Blake's plans he was loath</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to let them go. But nothing that had hap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pened had made his campaign against the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Turnbulls seem less sound; so with inward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trepidation he watched the squad embark</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the Eagle's two small boats and saw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them swallowed up by darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  By now, though it was fairly early by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the clock, nearly everyone had turned in,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A glance in the forward cabin showed it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">almost empty, save for two or three card</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">games at the tables. Neither Jake nor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Oacsby was in sight. It was time for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crowning step in his preparations--crip-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pling the party on board by arresting their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">leader, Jake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He commenced by turning out the first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mate, Smith, with orders to get a reliable</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deckhand and join him on the forward end</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the cabin deck. That done, he repaired</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the appointed spot and waited until two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shadowy forms approached through the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ready, Cap'n," Smith retorted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What'll we do now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Follow me," Andy said. "Halt when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I tell you, then close in when I call or whis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tle.

As he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">did so, his watchman on that side drew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">near, a poised pistol showing dimijy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through the darkness in his hand. He re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">placed it in his belt upon recognizing them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and after a whispered word resumed pa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">troling, while Captain Andy tiptoed the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rest of the way to Jake's cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The cabin, when he reached it, pre-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sented closed door and blinds, with only 3</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tiny spot of light winking through the key</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hole. Captain Andy considered--then ap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plied his car. After all, it was fair enough</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to learn what he might be running into.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And then he had slim ground for arresting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jake--just Oatsby's story, which might or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">might not be true, and his own conjectures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It would be helpful if he could hear some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing that would justify his action before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">taking it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A confused murmur was his only re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">URING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Andy z</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">start h</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seeing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">membet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was st</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">narrow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">side thf</seg><seg type="columnLine">166</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ward at first.

Jake's one remark had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to sweep away any doubt about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming foray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then out of the murmur Jake's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">came again, charged with ugliness this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get out!

I'm going to have you</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to greet them--with one of my men</seg><seg type="columnLine">on each side to blow your head off if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't do as you're told. What you'll do is</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell them the game's up, and they'd better</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrender peaceful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now pick up what you want for to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night and march."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment Jake tried to face it out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Andy's cold, contemptuous stare told</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it would be no use. Sullenly Jake</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to pack, and Captain Andy relaxed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his vigilance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HAT was a mistake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quick as a flash Jake</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped, and the impact</seg><seg type="columnLine">took both to the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jake on top. The gam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bler seized Andy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat with one hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached for a knife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Andy could hear men running outside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knew that Smith, his helper, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchman had come up. But they did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter; and he realized that they would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless he could free himself enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">call. He must go it alone--and only a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond or so would pass before the issue</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be decided.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now Jake rose a bit, propping himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the hand on Andy's throat. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement cut off all breath ; but likewise it</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave Andy his chance. Gathering all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength, he jerked sidewise. The move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment brought him free and he fought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But to his surprise Jake, with a gurg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling cry, fell limp, writhed, then lay shud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering on the floor. Leaping to his feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy saw the reason. His own movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">had upset Jake, and the latter, rolling over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fallen on his own knife! The fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">was over as quickly as it had started.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Andy saw that Jake had flung the knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">free before collapsing, and he picked it up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That done, he called, bringing the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">from outside. At sight of Jake they stared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then looked questioningly at their skipper</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he stood holding the weapon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's his," Andy explained. "He fell on</seg><seg type="columnLine">it while we were scuffling. Tell you more</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, but now you'd better take him to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin. Call that doctor in stateroom 42,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tell him to wait with Jake still I get</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. I'll be along in a few minutes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He watched them carry Jake out, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CROSS AND DOUBLE CROSS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">167</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">started searching the room. But now he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had little heart for it. Thanks to the scuf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fle and its outcome, his plans had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly wrong. Jake couldn't be used "now</seg><seg type="columnLine">to warn the others off. Neither was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alternative--massing men in readiness to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet the onslaught--advisable. That would</seg><seg type="columnLine">warn off everybody, and defeat his pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose of scotching the Turnbulls for good</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all. There was nothing for it now but</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fight both gangs at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can do it, though," he told himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And we will-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He broke off as he espied something</seg><seg type="columnLine">white protruding from the pocket of a coat</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung on a hook. It was a letter envelope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without address or postmark, evidently a</seg><seg type="columnLine">note for personal delivery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stepping to the light, Andy withdrew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enclosure and read it. It was was with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out superscripture and exceedingly short,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as follows:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Remember, Peabody, I have your boy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and whether you sec him or not after this</seg><seg type="columnLine">depends on whether you come clean.

So be sure you</seg><seg type="columnLine">COME CLEAN!	B.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Andy whistled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's something, anyway," he mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered. "It's Blake's writing. That's lus</seg><seg type="columnLine">'B,' sure 'nough. So there's a Peabody in</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and they've got a hold on him. Won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der who he is?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tapped the letter, pondering, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrugged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There'll be time enough later to figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that out. Better finish here and get on to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see how Jake's coming."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He placed the letter in his wallet and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed his search. But after half an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gave up. Save for the letter, the cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">had yielded nothing that would throw light</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Blake's scheme, and there was nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">further he could pry into. He extin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guished the lamp, stepped out and locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And that," he thought, "can be put</seg><seg type="columnLine">down as my second fool stunt this trip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Might better have left things as they were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Iess'n this letter turns out to be some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. And if Jake dies we'll have a mess</seg><seg type="columnLine">next port we make, on top of all this other</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But trouble from Jake's death, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned, would not be added. The doctor,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">who was waiting in Andy's cabin, said that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wound, while crippling, would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove fatal provided Jake was given rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and care. If given a steward to help he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was willing, he said, to see the first night</seg><seg type="columnLine">through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose this fellow got into a brawl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain?" he went on. "Figured that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">how he'd end up, after his actions today.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By the way, I want to thank you for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">why you've handled this trouble. It's beer?</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendid."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, that's part of the work," Andy an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered nervously. "No one could run a</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat without being able to handle things</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that, not on this river, anyhow. As to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jake, you guessed it. Tell you more about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it tomorrow. But I wonder, could you tel)</seg><seg type="columnLine">me one thing ? Do you know anyone among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passengers named Peabody?'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a wild shot. Andy knew it as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked the question. Peabody, if he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard, undoubtedly would have an alias.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And so it seemed, from the doctor's an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I don't. What sort of a fellow is</seg><seg type="columnLine">he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know him," Andy stated slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All I know is the name. But I judge he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">some kind of a crook--someone with a bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">record."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Peabody--Peabody--" the doctor mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered, then brightened. "You don't mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">the counterfeiter, Isaac Peabody, who's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted in Ohio? Thin fellow, short, mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle aged, sharp as a gimlet and sly as all</seg><seg type="columnLine">get out? They had papers out for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we left St. Louis."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Andy shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Couldn't say as to that, not knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Well, I've got a lot to do tonight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'd better be getting on. We'll talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it tomorrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peabody a counterfeiter--it was strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy thought, as he went to send the stew-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ard requested by the doctor, how counter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feiting kept crossing the trail. It bore out</seg><seg type="columnLine">his guess at Blake's scheme--renewed it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even though his ideas had been proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong at the time of the fight in the cabin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He snorted in disgust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've had bright ideas enough for one</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, Andy Corbin," he chided himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and you've muffed twice because of them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cut it out now and tend to business."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that admonition, he turned out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steward, sent him on his way, and joined</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harker, to spend the night jumping when-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever a board creaked, or the thud of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifting tree against the packet's side made</seg><seg type="columnLine">him think the attack had come.</seg><seg type="columnLine">168</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HEN the first gray flush</seg><seg type="columnLine">of visibility was paling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stars and thinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the velvety blackness</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the eastward tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">tops, Andy yawned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook Harker into</seg><seg type="columnLine">wakefulness, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought the deck. The nipping rawness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the misty dawn air felt good after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamp-lit stuffiness of the little cabin, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">revived his zest for action. He visited his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentinels on the cabin deck, found them</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleepy but alert, then sought the cargo deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here the tenseness of the cabin deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no counterpart. The watchman, sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to be on duty in the prow, had rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in a blanket anil was sleeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">peacefully, regardless of the dewy dia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monds which sprinkled his covering. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">deckhands, burly, lawless fellows who</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranked next to the Indians and bandits as</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrors of the river, looked harmless as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they snored comfortably in the warm space</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the raised boilers and the cargo</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck. Even the fireman, who theoretically</seg><seg type="columnLine">was awake maintaining steam, leaped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a doze to inspect his gages when Andy ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached. All these, at least, would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh when the fighting started, an hour or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two after sunup.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By novv gray light was permeating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest. The moldy night smell was pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and the birds were beginning to cheep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">2s they shook themselves awake. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">East a few lines of pink were streaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky. It was time to rouse the mates</seg><seg type="columnLine">and get the Eagle going. With a last look</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, Andy hastened to the texas deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shake a leg," he admonished Smith and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his partner, as he tumbled them out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We're going to have a fight in about an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour--with the Turnbulls."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both mates bounded from their bunks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanding particulars. WTiile they dressed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy explained, including the story of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money; then he sent them to get breakfast</seg><seg type="columnLine">and launch preparations for the encounter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Within ten minutes an excited crew was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashore casting off mooring lines and bring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing aboard the last bit of wood that could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be stowed, while others started building a</seg><seg type="columnLine">barricade of cargo along the starboard side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another ten minutes, and the paddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels began churning, sending the Eagle</seg><seg type="columnLine">up-stream to whatever fate might hold in</seg><seg type="columnLine">store for her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile Andy, over a cup of coffee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was giving instructions to Harker.</seg><seg type="columnLine">m "You stay in your cabin," he said, "un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til the rumpus forward is over. And keep</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the office locked, and your pistols ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then, when we've got things quieted on</seg><seg type="columnLine">board, you can come out and look to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers--excepting whatever Turnbull</seg><seg type="columnLine">men we may be holding. Better get every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one else back in the women's cabin. Proba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bly be safer there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, but I say!" Harker protested. "I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to be in this, you know!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course you would," Andy replied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but I'd rather not have you. You aren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">on to such affairs yet, and you might pot</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of our men as easy as a Turnbull.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No, you'll help more staying here, than</seg><seg type="columnLine">tending to the passengers--to say nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that being your job, anyway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> lie finished his coffee and left for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cargo deck. A few of the passengers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and about now, and Andy noticed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ail of them classed among the toughest cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomers aboard. Undoubtedly they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turnbull men, portents of the coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nodding in response to a dour greeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two, he passed through and l&gt;elow to</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the first mate was waiting with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of expectant deckhands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ready, sir," the mate reported. "I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">issued pistols, as you ordered."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The remark was superfluous, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">butts of the double-barreled derringers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were peeping from the waistbands of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. Andy's hand strayed to his pocket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lo touch one of his two six-shot Colt's--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only spedmen oE the new guns on</seg><seg type="columnLine">board, so far as he knew--and he glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one to another of the grinning, eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces before him. They were true Mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">souri River deck hands, all of them, never</seg><seg type="columnLine">so happy as when in a fight, and Andy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidence mounted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's our day, men," he told them, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole river'll be talking about how we</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleaned them. But don't go starting any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing till I give the word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''i'll be somewhere above when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting starts. At the first shot, come</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and jump in, same as we did last night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But be careful who you shoot, and don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot at all unless you have to. Fists will</seg><seg type="columnLine">do better, and you can swing them well</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough. The pistols are just for emer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gency, if someone gets you down, or draws</seg><seg type="columnLine">on you. Most of our shooting will be done</seg><seg type="columnLine">outboard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A shrill hoot from the whistle inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupted, and all glanced up the river. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eagle was heading southwest now, to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">around a massive bluff jutting out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the north shore. When she rounded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point and headed northwest, Spring Land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CROSS AND DOUBLE CROSS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">169</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing would be visible about half a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead on the starboard side. The whistle</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the customary warning that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming; and it was time for Andy to be at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his battle post.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Darting aft, he scrambled out a window,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped the edge of the deck above, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hauled himself up to the little gallery out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the after cabins. Disdaining cere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mony, he dashed through one of these,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the women's cabin, and into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor leading forward past Harker's</seg><seg type="columnLine">office. There he lingered in the shadows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening breathlessly for the signal that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would start him into action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a few minutes the Eagle swept on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her paddles beating in the rhythm of full</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed. Then a swing, perceptible enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a seasoned veteran like Captain Andy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">told that she was rounding the headland,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a faint tinkle below marked the signal</seg><seg type="columnLine">"stand by" for the landing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another tinkle and the engines slowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to half speed. A minute or two passed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes that seemed eternities--a shout</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward--and Andy knew that a heaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">line had been thrown out. Another min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute--the engines churned in a furious burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of paddling, then stopped. The Eagle was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being made fast to the bank. And then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">punctuating the silence, came the crack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rifle shot. Then another, and then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusillade. The battle was on at last!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T THE first shot Andy</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped forward. Simul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taneously a man ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared at the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor. For one re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealing instant, in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">time seemed standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">still, the man was mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionless. Then his arm rose; but Andy</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired and the man fell. Andy leaped over</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and roaring defiancc, lunged against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the full impact, of the gang's rush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly he was striking two, three</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways at once--firing with one hand, swing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with another, kicking at anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushing him. A pistol butt cracked down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his head; he gave under it, whirling as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did so, and came up with an uppercut to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jaw of his assailant. A shove sent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">limp form crashing into the mob behind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A gorilla-like sweep of the captain's long</seg><seg type="columnLine">right arm sent another after him; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy found himself in a little clearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One pistol was lost now and the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty. Hurling it into the mob ahead he</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed, diving under and rearing up to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">spill two more. Again he plunged, keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing always in the thick of them, carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the battle to them, denying them the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to use knife or bullet in the press</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bodies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a space of minutes he was irresisti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble, master of everything. Then even his</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant strength began to flag. He rallied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed again; but now he knew that help</seg><seg type="columnLine">was needed. Where were Smith and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">men? Why weren't they in it long ago?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Would they never come?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The roar of musketry outside gave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer, beat it into his surcharged brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">even through the red battle lust. The for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward gangway was swept by bullets;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith's men couldn't come. The fight was</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to him, and him alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gritting his teeth, he rallied for his last</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunge. He made it, spilled a man--felt a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pin prick in his back. A knife had touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">him finally-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A thudding impact on his back drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to his knees. He lunged up, felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife again, went down once more. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were getting the upper hand, would beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">him down unless help came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A shout burst into his numbing brain--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shout and the reverberation of a charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rallied his waning strength. He leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet, glanced about for a head to hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and saw his men go sweeping past. Cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">off forward, they had scrambled up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">port side, and assailed the mob from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">after cabin, as he had done!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He leaped forward, but the fight was</seg><seg type="columnLine">over here. As he reached his men, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had cornered the remaining gangsters, jam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">med them in a helpless mass against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the cabin, and were dragging them</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth one by one into custody of the guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith was forming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But cessation of the fight made the fir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing outside deafening now. The victory</seg><seg type="columnLine">still was scarce half complete. The gang</seg><seg type="columnLine">on land might yet turn the scale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Allowing himself one glance about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin, Andy scuttled into a starboard state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, brushed aside the pistol presented by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the frightened occupant, and leaped to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window. A moment lapsed while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">focused his spinning gaze, a task made</seg><seg type="columnLine">more difficult by the drifting powder</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke. Then the situation stood revealed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His own men, as he had planned, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe, firing through loop-holes they had ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged in the cargo barricade. The Turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulls, their first rush checked by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eagle's readiness, had dismounted and like-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise taken cover behind the woodpiles scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered about the little clearing. It was stale-</seg><seg type="columnLine">170</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  mate, each side unable to move against the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  fire of the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But the Eagle held the key to the situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in the soldiers, unless Tompkins had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped up. Eagerly Andy scanned the bluff</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see evidence of the sergeant and his men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As he did, several spurts of flame flecked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hillside. Some seconds passed; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">another volley came. Now Captain Andy</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood, and his heart wenr out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tompkins. The seasoned non-com, wise in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rough-and-tumble fighting of the coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try, had done the best thing possible. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had waited for the Turnbulls to spend their</seg><seg type="columnLine">first enthusiasm and settle into the strain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sustained combat; and now he was pick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them off when they could least stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">something unexpected!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A hand clapped on Andy's shoulder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he whirled, to see Smith, panting but</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly triumphant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "We got 'em," the first mate reported.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sitting in a row, and men to shoot 'em if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they bat an eyelash. All except three you</seg><seg type="columnLine">did in for keeps, and some more too groggy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sit up. What'll we do next?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How many men can you spare?" Andy</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Five, I guess; maybe six," replied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Bring them below, then, after me. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">can use the stairs now. When we're all</seg><seg type="columnLine">together we'll rush down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment sufficed to form the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">group at the forward door, and Andy</seg><seg type="columnLine">cocked an ear to listen. Tompkins' diver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion was effective: no bullets were whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tling now. He whipped open the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped down the stairs, and into the shelter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cargo, the others trooping after.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By now the fight was nearly over. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy glanced through an opening, he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">several Turnbulls leap from behind wood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piles and scurry for the brush. A volley</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the hillside dropped two; then eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray-clad figures rose from the brush and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">poising bayonet-tipped muskets, canne pour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down the hill at them. The gangsters</seg><seg type="columnLine">quailed, wheeled and headed for the boat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  That was the chance for the Eagle's men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swarming around the sides of the barri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cade, they leaped to the shore, clubbed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns, and charged their erstwhile assail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants. But the ruffians had had enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They and the others left unhit behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woodpiles dropped to their knees, held up</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hands, and the fight was over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now two tasks remained for Andy. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers, about whose ears this hurri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cane had burst so unexpectedly, must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">reassured; and the safety of the bank's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">money must be established. Leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tompkins and the others to secure the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners, Andy hurried back to discharge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">these duties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One job, however, did not arise. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounding the corner into the corridor past</seg><seg type="columnLine">the purser's office, Andy met Harker. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Englishman leaped forward and wrung the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand of his burly chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wonderful! Gigantic!" he burbled. "A</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular Waterloo, 'pen my word! Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">see how you did it, single-handed for three</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes if it was a second, 'gainst that</seg><seg type="columnLine">mob!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Andy, grinning in embarrassment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrenched his hand loose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's still work to do," hie said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How are the passengers?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harker's gesture dismissed the passen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers.	*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quite all right," he said. "Most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them stuck to their cabins. Those that</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't I herded aft. They're there now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">buzzing it over. Don't worry about them."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All right, then," Andy said. "There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">still one thing I hope you haven't forgot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten. W'e're still responsible for that money,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harker stared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," he answered, "but why fret</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it? I was with it all through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight, and here's the door, still locked, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I left it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doesn't mean anything," Andy growled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This fight wasn't the only string to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blake's bow, you know. Remains to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen if he's pulled another while we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still unconcerned, Harker opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and the two stepped in. The strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">box was in place, apparently all right, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it had been after the affray of the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. Somewhat reassured, they opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. The money still was inside, in order.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see?" Harker queried. "It's all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right and safe enough. Look, here it is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the packets of small bills on top, just as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had them when we counted them in. Here's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pack of tens, and here are twenties, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">here under them is the first pack of hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he cursed and plunged both</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands into the box. For a few frantic mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments he dug as a terrier digs into a hill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, giving each packet a bare instant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrutiny before flinging it aside. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had worked well into the heap, he paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">and glanced up with ashen face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This--this is terrible!" he gasped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Right when we'd licked them, too! We</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought this chap hadn't done anything last</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CROSS AND DOUBLE CROSS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">171</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">flight* but we were wrong. Except for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top packets this money is--is counterfeit!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OUNTERFEIT !" The</seg><seg type="columnLine">echo came from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door like a whipcrack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Andy and Har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ker whirled to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith and Tompkins</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing there, scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to believe what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had heard. Smith, knowing the story of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the money, had let out the exclamation;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as they stepped in, he explained to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tompkins. Then the members of the lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle group stared at each other, white faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">and silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All, that is, but Captain Andy. For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment the others thought he had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy. Instead of showing consternation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face was lighting with joyl</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Counterfeit!" he exclaimed, jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the box, and verified the pronounce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. Then he whipped about, flung his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cap to the ceiling, and, seizing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">astounded Harker by the arms, began</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing about the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Counterfeit sure enough," he chortled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and that makes everything right as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be! My notion was right, and we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the woods in fine shape now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped and grinned at the three,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose countenances plainly showed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">dumb amazement. Then he pointed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harker, and let out a roar of laughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't see it yet!" he chuckled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"After all the time you've had to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it! "But it means Blake's shot his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolt now--got rid of the last arrow in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiver--and we can catch up the man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">did it! So it's all clear sailing now. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch me clean things up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dashed into the corridor, all three of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and to their amazement turned, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward to assail one of the prisoners, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">aft toward the women's cabin. About half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way he stopped and hammered on one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin doors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Open up there!" he bellowed. "Open</seg><seg type="columnLine">up before I kick the door in !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harker identified the cabin as that occu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pied by the farmer, Oatsby--then jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a muffled shot sounded from within.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Andy leaped aside, then reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward one long arm, and pounded his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist on the door again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on!" he called. "No more funny</seg><seg type="columnLine">business, or I'll wring your neck!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The answer to that was another shot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy stood motionless, body and arm out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of range, until it had sounded; then he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped to a position before the door, hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bulk against it, and burst in. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a momentary scuffle, followed by si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence ; then Andy's voice rang out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on!" he called. "Catch him when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I toss him out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harker and Tompkins reached the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as Oatsby, bent almost double, cata-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulted between them, fetching his head a</seg><seg type="columnLine">resounding thwack against the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. As he wavered from the stunning</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock they seized him, jerked him upright,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Tompkins held him pinned against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got him nailed," he grunted. "See</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the captain, Harker."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No need," a cheery voice called, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy appeared in the door, a bulky object</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hands. After one glance Harker</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped with joy. It was a duplicate of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong box which had contained the bank's</seg><seg type="columnLine">money. But Andy blocked his attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to seize it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait," he directed, "and take that fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low to ycur office." He nodded at the pin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ioned Oatsby. "We'll straighten out every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing up there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within a few moments they were com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortably disposed--all except "Oatsby, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was held in a comer by Tompkins; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harker, key poised, at the strong box</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy had retrieved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," Andy said. "Open up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">let's see what's what."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a trice the box was open and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were peering eagerly inside. It was filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with money in regular stacks, just as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other was. Plunging his hand into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of the mass, Harker drew forth a</seg><seg type="columnLine">packet, riffled it, and handed it to Andy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The latter examined a few bills, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right," he said. "This is good money,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the real money, just as we put it in back</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in St. Louis. Oatsby here was clev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erer than we thought. Figured there</seg><seg type="columnLine">mightn't be time, I s'pose, to switch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, so he had a duplicate box, and just</seg><seg type="columnLine">switched boxes, contents and all. And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brains enough to salt the top of his box</seg><seg type="columnLine">with real money, in case we looked into it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blake fixed tilings at the bank, I'll bet, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the cashier would hand us the packets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of small bills last, the way he did. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">would bring them on top, and it'd cost</seg><seg type="columnLine">least to duplicate them for the fake box.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's a canny player, that fellow Blake, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wragged his head solemnly as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at Oatsby, then reached forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly, seized the little farmer by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">172</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRONTIER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">coat collar, and hauled him into the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now, gentlemen/* he said, his old-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time twinkle in his eyes, "we might as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean up the last mystery. This fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">passes as Oatsby, the farmer. But seein's</seg><seg type="columnLine">how he's given us so much worry, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">might as well know him right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sudden pressure from his clutching paw</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Oatsby's neck forced the startled pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oner into a grotesque bow. With the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in that position, Andy waved a hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him in the manner of a showman</seg><seg type="columnLine">displaying an oddity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So, gentlemen," he concluded his</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech, "I want you to meet Isaac Pea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, the slickest counterfeiter in seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">states. Those bills were samples of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">handiwork, made to order, I have 110 doubt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for this scheme!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He handed Oatsby--or Peabody, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">now stood revealed--back to the custody</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Tompkins, took a seat, and leaned back</seg><seg type="columnLine">in comfort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And that," he said, "is the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eagle's troubles for this voyage."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But wait a minute!" exclaimed Harker.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How did you figure it all out? I can see</seg><seg type="columnLine">now it was this counterfeit scheme you had</seg><seg type="columnLine">in mind, but how did you guess it at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">start?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It came easy--even if slow," Andy an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered. "You see, I started thinking it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't natural that Blake'd rest with just</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoping the Turnbulls would polish us off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That wasn't thorough enough for him, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">half. And I couldn't see him arranging to</seg><seg type="columnLine">let anyone else get away with half a mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion dollars, without trying to get a good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sized cut of it himself.

Tourists and steamship companies</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably growl a lot, but the pongyis don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want them rubbering around the temples,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that's the gist of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAIL POUCH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT readers keep a keen eye on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical makeup of the magazine, as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">well as its reading content, is evidenced by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the following letter:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Editor, Frontier Stories,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dear Sir:--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have just finished reading the March issue of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frontier Stokies and am eagerly waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next copy. It seems to me that I am always</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for the next month's issue; in fact, L</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish it were a semi-monthly so that it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be so long to wait in between times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There are several things that endear me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frontier Stories. To begin with, it has every</seg><seg type="columnLine">story complete--no serials to break off in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of the climax to leave one biting finger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nails and worrying or cussing the author until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next issue; darn all serials anyway. Next,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Contents page is one to be proud of. It tells</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a clear, concise way what to expcct, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes you feel as if you can hardly wait to start</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reading itself. Then the paper and printing</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, both which are the life of any maga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zine. The type and reading in Frontier Stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not equaled in any other magazine printed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally, we come right down to the heart of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazine itself, the stories and the authors.

The man I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would like to meet in Frontier Stories is W.</seg><seg type="columnLine">C.
