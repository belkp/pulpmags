City,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having them mailed back to him by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">associate on whom it was rebated</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He continued to issue forged train</seg><seg type="columnLine">checks during the entire month, bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same number as the original, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers being placed on with a number-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing machine In this way he could keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">a train check working every day, bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same number but if by chance, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forged train check was not mailed back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him he would cease using that number</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The forged check going to the audi-</seg><seg

Eli H Janney,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who at that time was unknown</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Janney had been brought up on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">farm in Virginia For fifteen years he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been experimenting in an attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to solve the coupler problem, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">early as 1873 had hit upon the design to</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the master car builders gave first</seg><seg type="columnLine">place For five years after getting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">patent he had tried in vain to interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroads in his invention</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His original invention was' a passen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger-car coupler, and for passenger-cars</seg><seg type="columnLine">the railroads were using the Miller hook,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and did not care to go to the expense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">making a change At last the Pennsyl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vania took a fancy to his coupler for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their passenger-cars</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, in 1882, using the same contour</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines for the clutching part of the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus, he invented an automatic freight</seg><seg type="columnLine">coupler, and it was this i-nvention that</seg><seg type="columnLine">won out in the master car builders' tests</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Janney's Two Devices</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Janney's first invention consisted of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">coupler body with a bifurcated head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a revolving hook or knuckle, with a ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tical lock actuated by a flat spring, lock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing automatically on the closing move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the knuckle His invention of</seg><seg type="columnLine">1882 had a vertically moving locking-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pin, especially suited to freight service</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the rules of the master car build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers prohibited them from adopting any</seg><seg type="columnLine">device covered by a patent, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they succeeded in inducing the parties in</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest to waive their patent rights to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Janney contour lines This opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the field for other inventors and manu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">facturers to come in and furnish coup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lers having the contour lines that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">association had adopted, but with differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent locking mechanisms</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even now the battle was only half</seg><seg type="columnLine">won

type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The railroads didn't care to spend the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money Congress had to take a hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in 1893 the Safety Appliance Act</seg><seg type="columnLine">was passed that compelled the roads to</seg><seg type="columnLine">use automatic couplers on all cars, giv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them

type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To-day, in spite of the fact of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight thousand patents that have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">granted, there are not more than fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes of couplers in general use, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">having Janney's contour lines, which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">master car builders made the standard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some of the manufacturers bought up</seg><seg type="columnLine">several of the patents to combine them</seg><seg type="columnLine">into one coupler, but it is safe to say that</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerably less than two hundred of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eight thousand were ever sold</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The making of automatic freight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">couplers is exclusively an American in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dustry In the British Isles and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">European countries they use screw coup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lers, which take several minutes to fasten,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the old link and pin American</seg><seg type="columnLine">manufacturers have tried many and many</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time to induce the Englishmen to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a change, but without success</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not one of the horde of coupler in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventors made any great fortune Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">few made anything But Colonel Mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ler's platform, buffer, and hook brought</seg><seg

despatcher's office in twenty-four</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours He came--a tall, dark - haired,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue-eyed young man--who spoke only</seg><seg type="columnLine">when

is cooled off rapidly, washed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out with cold water, and then fired up</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurriedly, the result is leaky flues and</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken

type="columnLine"> In the New York Central tests, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric locomotive weighing ninety-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">tons, of which seventy tons were on the</seg><seg

half an hour he came out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the belt of jungle and found himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a gentle decline It was the hill</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was bare of vegetation, save for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardy form of wiry grass Rocks were</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerous, and sometimes lie had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamber up a steep

type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could see the ocean 011 all sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">The first thing that attracted his atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was

All at once he realized what a fool he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been to let the pigs get away so</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily He might have knocked one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them over the head while it slept beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">him Yet the thought had not occurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the pigs were still snoring, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been the feeling that, after all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">■they were fellow lodgers, and it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been unnatural for Philip to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of assassinating a bedfellow for the sake</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a loin chop</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But

type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He got a large stone and began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">batter the top of one of the boxes The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood was quite

type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Inside the box he found a miscella-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neous collection of valuables There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were strings

The bulk of the stuff in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first box was made up of little golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">images--crude things with queer heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">and

there was little difficulty</seg><seg type="columnLine">in maintaining good natural ventilation in</seg><seg type="columnLine">both the tunnels and the stations, and</seg><seg

offices on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">upper floors An intake tunnel has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven under the inbound Jrain tunnel for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some distance toward the river</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Air is drawn out of the inbound river tun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel through these'openings, and the intake</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel by two fans located in the basement</seg><seg type="columnLine">below the track level These fans have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">capacity each of 57,000 cubic feet of air a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute They are one hundred and sixty</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches in diameter, and are driven by direct-</seg><seg type="columnLine">connected motors They exhaust the foul</seg><seg type="columnLine">air drawn out of the tunnels into an uptake</seg><seg type="columnLine">flue, which extends up to the level of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof of the building Adjoining this ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haust flue is a fresh-air flue, which also</seg><seg type="columnLine">passes down to the basement level, and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which air is drawn for cooling the trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formers and rotaries in the substation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No air is drawn from this flue directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the terminal station At the north end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of two of the platforms of the station there</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been installed motor-driven fans, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a capacity of fifteen thousand feet of</seg><seg

some dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance beyond the station With the aid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these four fans it is believed that the piston</seg><seg type="columnLine">action of the

the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lantern department, and the things he does</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him are awful The insignificant fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the instance he quotes does not occur</seg><seg type="columnLine">in By the Light of the Lantern de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partment at all but in the Editorial Carpet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">does not disturb

type="columnLine">must have lived close to a railroad at some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time in his life, and imagined that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">absorbed the points of practical

type="columnLine">plenty of able men whom you can get, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will have to pay them, as men of known</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability come high: but as it is at

type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The idea that the editor of By the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Light of the Lantern department once</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived close to

we</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand that he is a more than ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">narily important figure in the mechanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">department of one of the best

in sor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row than in anger: " Now look at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter seriously, and either give the proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">interpretation of a rule
