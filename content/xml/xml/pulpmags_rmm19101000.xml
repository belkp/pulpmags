The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell sang its musical, crooning note, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistle droned across the wide spaces, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">no hill sent back its voice, and the smiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">land received them with a wide-^ung wel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come as in days gone, and with happy prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ise for the days to come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once, toward evening, a galloping horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">attached to a wildly rocking buggy raced up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a country lane between the green hedges, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">contest with the engine for the moment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossing. The space between them narrowed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer and closer, until a flying curtain</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved, like a victorious banner, from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear of the outfit, after it had safely won</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crossing by an instant's lead.

With bared heads they walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">haltingly under the weight which the train</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave up to them, and, sliding it reverently</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the waiting, mud-stained spring-wagon</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the track, they placed a seat across it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus rode away with the great city's contri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bution to the quiet little churchyard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In silence, Labenburg and Billy watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speaking scene, and, when they started</seg><seg type="columnLine">on again, the hand upon the throttle drew it</seg><seg type="columnLine">open with a kindly touch. The bell, under</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy's steady hand, seemed to sound a slower</seg><seg type="columnLine">note, and the mournful chime of the whistle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">across all of that broad country, seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">■bear a deeper significance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the extra minutes used in the stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to be regained, and Labenburg went</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly about it, touching, adjusting, urging,</seg><seg type="columnLine">restraining, until the long line of coaches</seg><seg type="columnLine">again followed its flying leader in steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight, and sailed around the wide curve with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grace of a hawk in air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duly they delivered the pair of cooing</seg><seg type="columnLine">doves, who, apparently, were supposed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">living on showers of rice, and in due time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the judge strode away in majesty up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaded street of a suburban puddle in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DAY'S RUN.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lie was, perhaps, the biggest toad.

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He held out his hand to the visitor; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">veined and rather flabby - looking hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with more than one stone of price glinting</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its fingers. But Graham ignored it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neither did he take off his coat or make any</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of sitting down. Something in the pal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lor of his face, the tension of his mouth, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen, blue light in his eyes, gave notice that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had come on no friendly visit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dill shifted uneasily in his chair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced at the clock, wishing himself well</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.

Even the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham had, on his class-day eve, spoken</seg><seg type="columnLine">right honorably for the hand of Agnes, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">amused the lawyer, even though at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time it had vexed him a trifle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Dill had quite other plans in view</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that his only girl should marry a por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trait painter--" a mere dauber," as he called</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Bruskly, the lawyer had sent him</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his business, anxious for more than one</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason to be well rid of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a year and a half he had seen nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Graham; had heard nothing of him, for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrewd as he was, Agnes had been far</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrewder. (What girl in love but can outwit</seg><seg type="columnLine">her father in sending or receiving letters?)</seg><seg type="columnLine">The lawyer, in a word, had all but banished</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham from mind; but now there stood the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, unwelcome as the devil himself, gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at him with a look that boded trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, John--ah--what's the matter now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my boy ? " the old man asked again un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily. Many a time had he faced hostile</seg><seg type="columnLine">juries, arrogant judges; but never had he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fear that this mute, accusing look in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spired. " Can it be, can it possibly be "--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thought flashed to him--" that he knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last? Merciful Heaven, if he does--what</seg><seg type="columnLine">then ? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Already half in a panic, he cast about him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a channel of escape. Out from the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">recesses of his mind fluttered evil memories,</seg><seg type="columnLine">memories which he had hoped might never</seg><seg type="columnLine">be evoked again. To cover his emotion he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fumbled for his handkerchief, and loudly</seg><seg type="columnLine">blew his nose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You scoundrel! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What?" cried the old man, starting half</seg><seg type="columnLine">up as though by the force of a suddenly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leased spring. " What--what's that you say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I said ' scoundrel,' " answered Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a low, steady voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you deaf, all of a sudden?

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dill tried hard to laugh, but it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghastly mockery of merriment. His face</seg><seg type="columnLine">flushed red, then went sickly pale. Back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chair he sank. The glasses fell from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose. He did not pick them up; but sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">there shaking as with palsy, utterly unnerved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The suddenness of the attack had found him</seg><seg type="columnLine">off his guard for once. He crouched and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cringed a moment, rubbing his nerveless old</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands together, a mean and pitiable thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he looked up, or tried to, for his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not meet Graham's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You--you'd better go home, my boy," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stammered.

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old lawyer, panic-stricken, foreseeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">visions of he knew not what violence, glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the telephone that stood on his desk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham saw the glance. Quietly he reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, seized the instrument and set it on top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the desk, out of Dill's reach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said he.

He fumbled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lap for his glasses, put them on, looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the clock again, and stood up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " There, now; that will do," said he.

Quite so, indeed!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham snapped his fingers. " I guess we</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't--" he began, then checked himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His powerful arms crossed on the desk-top,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stood there gazing at Dill with steady and</seg><seg type="columnLine">contemptuous eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man, his own master again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrugged his shoulders and turned away to</seg><seg type="columnLine">where his overcoat and tall silk hat hung be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE STEELED CONSCIENCE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">37</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">side the window.

What else can you do but ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mit it? You've got to!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Admit," resumed the lawyer, bowing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and secretly cursing his inability to</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeeze a tear from his dry eyes--a tear that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might drop effectively on the blurred page.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" Own the wrong. Repent. A great word</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, repent--ah!

Graham snapped. "I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want any of your driveling cant this time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've heard too much of that--far too much--</seg><seg type="columnLine">already. I'm here to deal with facts to-night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hypocritical speculations. Suppose I</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop any action against you--not for your</seg><seg type="columnLine">sake, mind, but hers--what then ? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then? Why, restitution, certainly, cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly, my dear fellow. Restitution in full! "</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed Dill, his heart swelling with a sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den crafty joy. " The original sum, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, was--I mean, you know, it's in bonds</seg><seg type="columnLine">at present. All secure. The very best. Trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">me for that!" And, with a chuckle, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubbed his hands together. " Bonds. In my</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe. With your permission, I'll show you*,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eh ? " He nodded at the massive safe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in the far corner of the office.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE STEELED CONSCIENCE.	41</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go on; get them; let's see them," bade</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham. "It's a dirty business at best. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate to touch or even see them; it's like taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood-money--but it's mine, and I'm going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have it. If it wasn't for Agnes, I swear</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you I'd have satisfaction out of you, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You'd go up for this, so help me--but my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands are tied, by her. Thank her for that!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Go on; bring them. Let's see the cursed</seg><seg type="columnLine">things."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dill stood up, adjusted his glasses, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked slowly over to the corner. In his</seg><seg type="columnLine">devious brain a plan had formed--was form-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing even now. Every second's respite was</seg><seg type="columnLine">precious as diamonds to him. If he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">only hold the young man there a little while,</seg><seg type="columnLine">parley with him, delay him, he felt that all</seg><seg type="columnLine">might yet be well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Never had he faced a judge or jury when</seg><seg type="columnLine">one-hundredth part so much had been at</seg><seg type="columnLine">stake for him as now. He realized that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a supreme crisis in his life; that every</seg><seg type="columnLine">atom of his craft would have to come into</seg><seg type="columnLine">play if he were to win out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To his head he pressed a hand, and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">there a moment before the safe, thinking--</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking with feverish haste.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, go on," Graham cried. "Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't you open it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait--wait just a minute, please,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">quavered Dill. " The combination--ah--all</seg><seg type="columnLine">this unpleasantness has quite driven it out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind. Just a minute you'll grant me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't you ? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Think away. But, mind you, I haven't</seg><seg type="columnLine">got all night to waste on you! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dill leered craftily to himself, his back</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned toward Graham. Silently to himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">he mouthed a Curse; then, his plan full-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fledged, knelt before the safe. With lean</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers he spun the knob, stopped it, turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">it back again, and once more reversed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards clicked. He tugged at the handle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The heavy door swung outward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Presently, presently! " he exclaimed. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance over his shoulder assured him that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man still stood beside the desk, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that from there he could not see the interior</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the safe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Certain of this much, he quietly unlocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pulled out a lower drawer. In it lay a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue-barreled revolver, fully loaded. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dexterity that would have done credit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hermann, he slid this into his breast-pocket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then shut the drawer again and locked it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. not there," said he. "Let me see.</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, where did I put them last? This dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussion has quite upset me; bless my soul,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it has! ''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham, exasperated almost to the limits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of endurance, stepped over to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None of that now!" he exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" That won't go with me, you know. Come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce them! I haven't any time to lose!</seg><seg type="columnLine">You hear? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Why, how impatient we are, to be sure! "</seg><seg type="columnLine">retorted Dill, his courage strengthening</seg><seg type="columnLine">every second now. " Surely you wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurry an old man--old enough to be--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I'll give you just two minutes by that</seg><seg type="columnLine">clock!" Graham interrupted. "After that</seg><seg type="columnLine">--well, I won't guarantee anything. If I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did the right thing by you--hmmm!--go on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyhow. Get them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dill opened another drawer. From it he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted a large packet wrapped in lawyers'</seg><seg type="columnLine">tape and sealed with wax.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, here we are! " he exclaimed, getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">up painfully from the carpet and dusting off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knees of his well-creased trousers. "Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then?" And, bowing to Graham, he ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured toward the desk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham turned,back toward it. automat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ically obeying the suggestion. A man less</seg><seg type="columnLine">clever and astute than Dill might easily have</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot him; but such was in nowise the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's game. He knew a dozen tricks to beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. All that he wanted for the moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just to get Graham's eyes off him. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Graham turned, Dill stepped backward</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the safe. His arm went out. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand sought and found the little knob of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">messenger - call. Instantly he punched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knob; then, close behind the young man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came over to his chair again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat down. Graham stood beside him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face was pale, his eyes were like twin</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue fires.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Better draw up a chair here and make</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself comfortable while we settle things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't you ? " queried the lawyer, with mock</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospitality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham made no answer, save, " Go on!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Open them! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " In a minute--ah--certainly, yes, yes, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed," said Dill, now sparring for evei'y sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond's time. " Lord bless me, but they're</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly sealed, though! " And he made as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though to break the wax. But, before he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, he looked up again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The amount?" asked he. "Really, now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my dear young man, you haven't--that is, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount, you know ? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So! Forgotten, have you?" sneered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham. "Mind, I'm not asking for a pen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ny's interest. I don't believe in it, anyhow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I wouldn't take it from you if I did.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just the original money; that's all. The sum</seg><seg type="columnLine">42</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD.

Just that; not one cent</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. Well ? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lawyer, sweating now with a soul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">racking eagerness to hold Graham off for</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a few minutes more, took up the diary</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, turned the pages toward the end, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed as though seeking to refresh his mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ory. But all the writing there, traced in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere scrawl, had faded so that it was nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">undecipherable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last few pages, as he thumbed them</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, showed only a pot-hook here and there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dill's face hardened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " So, then, is that all you've got to show? "</seg><seg type="columnLine">he queried in assumed solicitude. " But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">really, my dear boy--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Oh, you can't dodge that way," cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham, holding his temper only with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort. He fumbled in his pocket 'again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled out a flat package, ripped it open, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed down onto the desk a score or so of</seg><seg type="columnLine">photographic prints.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " There! Look at those! " commanded he.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dill took them up, and, with deliberation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied one or two.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You--you've--but how the deuce, man ? "</seg><seg type="columnLine">he blurted, for the instant startled out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-assurance. For on each print appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">a page of the diary, and its writing, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneven, as if done by a feeble hand, was per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly legible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing simpler," answered Graham.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, I thought it all out in advance, never</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear. I simply used a common method; took</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half-dozen films of each page, laid them</seg><seg type="columnLine">together, and printed through. A knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of photography isn't such a bad thing, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, eh? Yes, Dill, I've got the goods on you</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time. See there, for instance? Read</seg><seg type="columnLine">that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tapped one of the prints. The lawyer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazed, yet still intent on using every possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble moment of time, read slowly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           Murchison, February 20, 1889.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I know, now, that the end is near. D. is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> all kindness and encouragement; he tells me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shall be myself again, once we get out of this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> blazing Gehenna, but I know better.

In the corridor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sounded the opening, the closing, of an ele-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vator. Steps came quickly along the hall-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">" Go on! " commanded Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dill, in a gasping, nervous sort of voice,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">resumed:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--the guardianship and the .protection of--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A hand fumbled at the knob of the outer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">office door. Graham, with an exclamation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of impatience, half turned toward it. Then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he remembered that the door was locked and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that the key lay safely in his pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Never you mind about that!" said he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">angrily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But Dill, this time, did not obey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Some one was rapping, was shaking, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">" Say, are you going to read, or not ? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cried Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dill, suddenly defiant, stood up. Over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into the back of the desk he swept the diary</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the prints.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In Graham's face he snapped his fingers,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then, with a loud voice, shouted:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Not one cent, you dastardly blackmailer!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Kill me, if you will, but not a penny--not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one!

Behind him,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pale and staring, peered a blue-clad messen-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ger-boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Help, here! Murder!" howled the law-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A sudden weight flung itself on Graham's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">broad neck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE STEELED CONSCIENCE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">43</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham, Dill, and the elevator-man all</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down together by the desk in a fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      CHAPTER IV.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      Whipsawed by Fate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TV/TADDENED beyond any human limits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of endurance, Graham wrenched him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self free, and staggered up; but again the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevator - man came at him, with his fists</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham ducked the blow and landed hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the man's jaw, driving him back, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant. But now Dill was up. With sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prising strength for so old a man, the lawyer</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped the messenger-bov round by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, cried " Run! Police! " and sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">him flying toward the door. Then into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pocket he crammed the diary and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">photographs. Graham caught a glimpse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this; of the old man striking his own face</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice, thrice, with all the force of his clenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist. But, beyond this instantaneous glance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had no time to notice anything. For now</seg><seg type="columnLine">the elevator-man, mad clear through and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lusting for battle, drove at him again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham tried to parry; but his long, wet</seg><seg type="columnLine">ulster hampered him. He dodged back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbling over something. Dill kicked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shins viciously. Before he could pull to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, the Irishman had landed a bone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking upper-cut. Graham fell. His head</seg><seg type="columnLine">went crack against the corner of the desk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here, hold on!" he tried to cry. "Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">me explain--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But suddenly everything seemed to spin</seg><seg type="columnLine">round and round. The light dazzled in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. Everything got black. A roaring filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ears.

Then--nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Consciousness dawned again with the feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of some hard, cold substance on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Feebly he blinked his eyes open, still try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to understand just what had happened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just what it was that hampered his move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments. He sought to move his hands, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not. He swallowed hard. It hurt him</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruelly. His throat was lame and sore and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bruised, and through his head shot brutal</seg><seg type="columnLine">pains. On his forehead something warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sticky seemed to be crawling--something</seg><seg type="columnLine">that half-blinded him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--I--let me explain--" he stammered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">again thickly. An oath and coarse laughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered him. He felt himself being raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shaken by the arm. Then all at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">he perceived that he was standing limply in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle of the office, hands manacled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a couple of policemen gripping hold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as though their very lives depended on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flesh-bruising intensity of their hold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of them had a night-stick raised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, d'youse want any more?" gibed</seg><seg type="columnLine">he.

In the United States, it is customary to</seg><seg type="columnLine">express curvature in degrees noted by the deflec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion from the tangent measured at stations 100</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet apart. In other words, the number of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grees of central angle subtended by a chord of</seg><seg type="columnLine">100 feet, represents the "degree curve." One de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gree of curvature is equal to a radius of 5,730 feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therefore, the number of degrees divided into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">5.730	gives the radius in feet, or, per contra, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of feet radius divided into 5,730 gives the</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of degrees.

Golds-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worthy came to Arizona on account of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">family troubles, and his family troubles</seg><seg type="columnLine">came along as a second section and caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It wouldn't be right to unload all he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that evening, and I couldn't begin to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell it like he did, for there are 110 mandolins</seg><seg type="columnLine">and guitars playing in the distance, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arizona dusk, no great big sense of loneli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, to make up the proper setting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After Bart Goldie had drifted through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheep-skin factory, he apparently-awoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the fact that he had wasted about four</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of his life and a whole lot of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">governor's money, cultivating a football</seg><seg type="columnLine">crop of hqlr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the governor wasn't in the mattress</seg><seg type="columnLine">business he didn't have much use for hair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I guess there must have been a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">stormy conversation, after which the governor</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked the safe which held the incubating</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonds and went home, informing Bart that</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he had amounted to something more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a village sport with its hair parted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the middle, he would be glad to have him</seg><seg type="columnLine">come into the business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seems as if Bart grew real peevish</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it, and informed the governor that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could get along without a parental helper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if lie had to double the hills, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">let the matter rest right there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I guess that while Bart put up a loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistle the steam was really very low. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't say as much, but by plain addition</seg><seg type="columnLine">and subtraction, I figured out that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just about to ask a young lady to marry</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, banking on father for the price of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marriage license and the first month's rent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young lady was Lois Martin. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">met her in college, and. having been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">genuine football hero, he was a favorite in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the betting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After the governor cut the train line, Bart</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to think it over. He couldn't ask the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl , to live in a box car when she had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to a Pullman, and he seemed to realize</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he wasn't going to have a great deal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack when he tried to persuade her father,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">when, technically speaking, he should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been arrested for having no visible means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">support.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew that Martin was a railroad offi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cial, and at that time he was connected with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an Eastern trunk line, and believing if he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, went out and made good at the railroad</seg><seg type="columnLine">game, papa would be more apt to favor him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie started out gaily as a light extra for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">West.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A year passed without seeing Bart made</seg><seg type="columnLine">president of a road. He kept going far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther West until he landed at Winslow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell into the place of roadmaster of the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">division. In the meantime, the Eastern trunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">line, by one of those juggling stunts, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into control of the A. and P., and Martin</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sent out in the capacity of general man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ager to improve the property and bring it</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the standard of the'Eastern road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That's about the how of it. I'm not say-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that Miss Martin could not have given</seg><seg type="columnLine">the why of it in a very interesting way, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an innocent bachelor who don't know more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than enough to enable him to sign the dotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">line on the orders and copy car and seal</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers, should never speculate on what a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman might say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I will venture this much: that if she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">known that Bart Goldie was doing his lapse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">working day and night like a heathen, for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting to go after his pay-check about half</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time, just in the hope of some day</seg><seg type="columnLine">amounting to something more than a section</seg><seg type="columnLine">boss or a roadmaster, she would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty proud of him, no matter what kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a woman she was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I'm going to have this woman, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">day," remarked Goldie that evening when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saved my life. I'd have died if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not told me. " And before I have her I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">make good. Make good in a big way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baldy. I'll do it some day, but it has to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon. I'm afraid some one will rob me</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the one woman in the world. I'm running</seg><seg type="columnLine">on short time--that's what worries me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, I'm not much at advising in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a love affair, but Bart was so earnest about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it I had to say something.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I understand," I said, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew I didn't understand, and I knew it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too.

If I had waited another month I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have doubled it, for after Bart Goldie</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that Lois Martin was in our neck of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woods, he began to make things move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he started he went some place. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">never found him waiting on a siding. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was always on the main line, and he had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of making things go that made a hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">with every man on the division.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You know just how nervous a fellow feels</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he finds he's on short time. You leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last station with more than running time</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which to make your meet, and get about</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-way over when you find a box so hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">it has to be packed at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again, the hog gets to slipping or won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam, and one minute follows the other un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til you look at your watch and find that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have just enough time to get there with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out figuring for the five minutes in the clear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You do the hurdle race over the tops for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head-end and find the eagle-eve with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch in his hand, and the fireman just</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to get down and push. By that time</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have eight miles to go in eight minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a grade that would be steep for a flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine. You know you should run for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a flag, and you're not sure but that even</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the old man is going to present you</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a bunch of brownies or a tin can, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally you decide to take a chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is just one more curve, and then it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight track, and you keep chugging away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">promising yourself that if you get out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this without losing a piece of your cuticle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will establish squatter's rights on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next side-track, if you hkveh't enough time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make the next station and clear by a week.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You get around the last curve onto the</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight-away, you see the other fellow fog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging into the station four miles beyond, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you wonder if there is any possible chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his having gone blind since the doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">examined his eyes. Of course, the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow is just as anxious to avoid a main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line meet as you are, and while he blusters</seg><seg type="columnLine">around a bit when you crawl in ever the</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch with your tail between your legs, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that he knows that the next day you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will probably be waiting for him and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be dealing in short time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I suppose Bart felt the same way. Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin's headquarters were in San Francisco,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the family made its home there. A large</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of fellows in San Francisco are in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the market for housekeepers, and there was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">always the chance that some fellow would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come along and take Bart's running orders</seg><seg type="columnLine">and go ahead of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While he never said as much, I'm sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that worried him as much as anything else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few days after Bart and I were back</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the cinder-pit work, we were in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear one morning at Bellemont for No. 7.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We happened to be standing at the east</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch when the varnished wagons came in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when they stopped, Martin's private car,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was on the rear, was just opposite us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Miss Martin and her mother were out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the observation platform.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bart saw her just as quickly as she saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. She beckoned to him and he went over</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a chat. No. 7 had cleared our switch</seg><seg type="columnLine">by fifty feet, and if I had been a real con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ductor I would have pulled out, but 1 waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Bart to have his little talk, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">No. 7 began to move it looked for a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if Bart was going to hang on the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate. However, he finally let go, and with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave of his hand came back to earth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cinder train--his face glowing like one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those electric signs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I never had to work so hard in all my</seg><seg type="columnLine">life as I did the rest of that day. It looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if Bart wanted to pull down that cinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain and haul it away to ballast the</seg><seg type="columnLine">track from Bellemont to Albuquerque, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than three hundred and fifty miles, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore quitting time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was on Friday morning. I know, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause we had mackerel for breakfast and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sardines for supper. Sunday morning, Bart</seg><seg type="columnLine">said he was going over to Williams for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day on a little personal business, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would not be back until the local Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day morning. He told where he wanted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work to begin on Monday, and I promised to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a string of loads ready to leave when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I knew that the Grand Canon was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixty-three miles from Williams, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">No. 7 connected widi the plug which went</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the canon in the morning, coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">back at night in time to catch the night lim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ited, which went through the cinder pit like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fellow who never had smallpox going by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pest-house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I didn't say a word. If he wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go around spending Sunday in riotous liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, when he should have been resting up so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would be able to earn his money,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was his business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just to show how valuable a man he was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pit opened Monday morning the same as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he had been there. I told him when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ON SHORT TIME.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">81</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">got back that he hadn't missed him a bit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, so far as I was concerned, he could take</seg><seg type="columnLine">every other Sunday off if he wanted to. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had Torty loads coupled up and the engine</seg><seg type="columnLine">on them a long time before the local showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, when the local did come, Bart</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on it. At first, when he dropped off the-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caboose I wasn't sure it was Bart, for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked more like a traveling man from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gents' furnishing-houste than he did like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bart Goldie or a roadmaster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had a brand-new outfit, from his shoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the black hat, a real white shirt, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand-up collar that reminded me of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand fence down near Hardy; a gray suit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, while it wasn't as noisy as some I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen, was pretty loud for a quiet little ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let like the cinder pit, where about the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">things of color were the cook, the water-flag,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the semaphore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He Was carrying a suit-case, one of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind which keep a fellow guessing whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's full of thousand-dollar bills or interest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing bonds, and he wore the clothes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried the suit-case just, as if they belonged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't go over to the pit after he</seg><seg type="columnLine">alighted from the local. Walked up to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, and asked:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How's everything? How soon will you</seg><seg type="columnLine">be ready to start out with your train?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Everything is in better shape than it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">been this year," I replied, taking off my hat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and standing on one foot. " My train has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been waiting since daybreak for you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thought that might take some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">starch out of his shirt.

To hear him tell it, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the confidant and chief adviser of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">all; and as for old man Martin--well, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed that, after all, Martin was only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeble-minded old maid, and that if it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been for Smartley he wouldn't have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to hold his job a minute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Ah, yes, Mr. Goldsworthy," he said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bart, after I came up, " I am very close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Martin, you know.

He started out by</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing me that a straight line is the short-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est distance between two points. He went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on for an hour about hypotenuses and hypo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dermics and epileptics, until I began to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Bart really knew something.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went 011 to show that, other things</seg><seg type="columnLine">being equal, by adding the wheel-base of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the locomotive to the length of the rail, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">multiplying the result by the- number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">toothpicks in a tie, plus the square root</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the number on the caboose, gave a sum</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal to what a Baldwin hog could pull on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tWenty-per cent grade, provided the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ductor and the rear shack didn't drag their</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This sum, when gently mixed in a bucket</seg><seg type="columnLine">of warm water, would leave a residue, which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when divided by the number on the engine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be the cube root of the price of beans</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Mississippi went Republican.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having explained these elemental truths</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me, Bart went on to say that if the track</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Supai to Ash Fork was built in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight line, it would be shorter than it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">running around the neighborhood without its</seg><seg type="columnLine">parents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," says Bart, "I propose to suggest</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Mr. Martin that we build a cut-off from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Supai to Ash Fork, running the track down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left side of Johnson's Canon--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said a few other things, but while I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was willing to indulge him, there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">limit.

For some time</seg><seg type="columnLine">these were all the fashion. Imlay felt so</seg><seg type="columnLine">proud of his handiwork that he nearly wiped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gut his profits in putting on extra flourishes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gaudy paint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each new triumph of his skill was set out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Monument Square for the admiration of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all beholders for several days before being</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned over to the railroad company. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Imlay's masterpieces, named the " Ohio,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">built in August, 1830, was described by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baltimore American as being very elegant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had seats for twelve inside and a seat at</seg><seg type="columnLine">each end for six, including the driver, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">on top was a double sofa; placed lengthwise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with room for twelve more. A wire netting</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept the passengers from falling off, and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">awning protected them from the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such handsome vehicles, of course, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">whetted the public appetite for railroad travel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the time inevitably came when something</seg><seg type="columnLine">more capacious was demanded. Ross Wi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nans, the great locomotive builder, who never</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to step into the breach when the Balti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">more and Ohio needed an idea, thereupon</seg><seg type="columnLine">built the first eight-wheeled passenger-car,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he named the " Columbus."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was simply a large box with benches</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside and on top, reached by a ladder at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner. When the design was first submitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the board of directors they argued long</seg><seg type="columnLine">and eamesdy whether the new car should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have an aisle down the center, or a narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge along the outside on which the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ductor could walk. The advocates of the cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter aisle won the day, and the rough draft of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the American type of passenger-car was given</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Its essential features were all there, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems now as if it should have been a simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter to develop the details as they were re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired, but it was not. On the contrary, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passenger-car reached its present state only</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a long struggle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As in the case of every other feature of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroad, the volunteers were prolific and per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistent in their proffers of solutions for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">problems pertaining to cars. Louis Wern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wag, an architect, of Harper's Ferry, proudly</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhibited at the office of the Charleston</seg><seg type="columnLine">(Virginia) Free Press, in August, 1832, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">model of his "self-regulating, or self-direct-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing railroad-car." Wernwag's idea was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce a car that could run around curves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To accomplish this end he used six wheels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center pair being the regulators. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">this center-axle hounds, or guiding poles, led</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the other axles to guide them around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curves. The axles of the main wheels were</seg><seg type="columnLine">jointed in the center so that the outside wheel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in going around curves, could travel the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster. The enthusiastic editor of the Free</seg><seg type="columnLine">Press declared:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " We verily believe a car might be con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed on this plan to run around a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon-sized haystack."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But haystacks not being a usual feature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroad equipment, Wernwag's car did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a hit, though six-wheeled cars quite as</seg><seg type="columnLine">extraordinary were actually operated on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baltimore and Susquehanna in 1844. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">six-wheeled cars had wooden springs, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisting of white-ash planks 2 by 6 inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">and 16 feet long. It was the proud boast</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the builders that these cars carried a much</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavier live load in proportion to their dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight than the cars, or section-boats, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">alternately floated on the canals or trundled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the State railroads of Pennsylvania.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Only Armored Cars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Baltimore and Susquehanna achieved</seg><seg type="columnLine">the additional distinction of running the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">armored cars ever used in regular service in</seg><seg type="columnLine">America. The armor consisted of a sheath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of one-inch oak boards beneath the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prevent passengers from being impaled on</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance " snakeheads," or strap-rails that took</seg><seg type="columnLine">a notion to curl up under the weight of pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing trains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Speaking of springs recalls the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the original car-builders thought such refine-^</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of luxury quite superfluous.

Then, in 1857, some unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">genius improved on the air-spring by sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stituting a diaphragm for the piston and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pouring some sugar-house molasses into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder as a seal.

The wooden cars were very</seg><seg type="columnLine">frail, and in collisions were almost sure to</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescope, with frightful loss of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An attempt was made to introduce the La</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mothe iron car, the first metal passenger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coach, seating sixty passengers, and guaran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teed to be cheaper, more durable, lighter by</seg><seg type="columnLine">two tons, and stronger and safer in collisions</seg><seg type="columnLine">than wooden cars; but railroad men would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have none of it, although a number of iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">passenger-cars were built in 1855 at Hamburg</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the Russian government, and the Reading</seg><seg type="columnLine">Railroad began using iron coal-cars as early</seg><seg type="columnLine">as 1844.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In fact, coaches seemed to be especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">designed to facilitate telescoping, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coupler and buffer were placed below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car-sills so as to offer the least possible resist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance. Ezra Miller, a well-educated, promi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nent citizen of Wisconsin, undertook to rem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edy this fault. In 1863 he obtained his first</seg><seg type="columnLine">patent for the Miller platform, coupler, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">buffer, which was hailed as "the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">life-saving invention of the age."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Miller platform was placed on a line</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the sills, where it would have the great-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est power of resistance. Every old-time rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">road man will remember die " Miller hook</seg><seg type="columnLine">coupler" and its spring buffer, for the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventor lived to see it adopted by every railroad</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the United States. It not only made Miller</seg><seg type="columnLine">rich, but, by reducing the space between</seg><seg type="columnLine">platforms, it enabled people to pass from car</seg><seg type="columnLine">to car in a train without risking dieir lives,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it greatly increased comfort by taking up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slack in trains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the adoption of die Miller platform</seg><seg type="columnLine">and coupler, and with the safeguards afforded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the W'estinghouse air-brake, and the lux-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uries introduced under die leadership of Pull-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, as already described in The Railroad</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man's Magazine, the evolution of the pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">senger-cai; was brought up to date. To-day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the big roads are considering the all-steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">car as the future passenger-coach.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood six feet two in his stock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-feet. His hair was as red</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a sunset, his face was freck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">led, and his hands and arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">betokened the strength that</seg><seg type="columnLine">conies of an out-of-door life. Big in bone</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brawn, he-was easily the master of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation that came up for settlement in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little camp at Lagunitas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for Lagunitas, it was a mining-camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">that nestled in the foothills of Calaveras</seg><seg type="columnLine">County, California. Not being on the map,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not dignified in the official archives</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Washington, D. C., as being worthy of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit of the census-taker. However, it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a population of exactly 1,747--and they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">all Americans born. Lagunitas boasted of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this fact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One thousand of the population were of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the masculine gender, and, in that goodly</seg><seg type="columnLine">number, Anderson was the king.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was king because he could settle any</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispute; he was king because he eould have</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way in practically any old thing, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was king because there was not a man in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place who could land on Anderson's solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">plexus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many had trained and tried, but the re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">95</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">suit was always the same. When the count</seg><seg type="columnLine">was given they failed to rise. Though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was forty years old, Anderson never failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to "come back" whenever he had to fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, it so happened that Anderson never</seg><seg type="columnLine">" fell " for the fair sex. Many a young wom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">an of the camp had admired him for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">" shape " and his pugilistic prowess, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had let her feelings become known to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the coyest of coy glances, but to all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them Anderson simply said, "Beat it"--not</seg><seg type="columnLine">in so many words, but with the look of dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gust and disdain for which he was noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and which meant more than words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anderson had a run-in with Tim Logan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all because the two men could not agree</seg><seg type="columnLine">which should deal in a very exciting poker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">game. It was a game with a twenty-five-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollar ante and no limit as to time. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">could " sit in "--provided you had money--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and once " in " you could play for days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This particular game had run for nearlv</seg><seg type="columnLine">two days and nights. An agreement was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made that a recess of thirty minutes would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken in order that the inner man might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">replenished with a goodly supply of fried</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham sandwiches and beer. When the recess</seg><seg type="columnLine">was called, Logan had been winning and</seg><seg type="columnLine">96</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Anderson losing, and the other three play-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers had whipsawed between good luck and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad luck like so many ping-pong balls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At length, when the game was resumed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anderson went at it with a mind that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripe for any kind of trouble. After the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">round had been dealt- and he had lost, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubled up his fist like a Janney coupler and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought it down on the table with a bang</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sent the cards in all directions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Boys," he exclaimed, " I'm going to win</seg><seg type="columnLine">or lose something here before the night is</seg><seg type="columnLine">over.

"If I lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, I'm broke, and it's the first time I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">been so situated in many a day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slim produced his fifty and laid it along-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side Anderson's on a corner of the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was conveniently reserved for side</seg><seg type="columnLine">bets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The game went on. One or two hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dealt. Anderson bluffed a small "jack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pot" and raked in seventeen dollars. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile played over his face, for he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his luck had changed. Then the deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">was passed to him. He ran out the cards</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the agility of long practise, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the final one of his five had fallen in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him, he picked them up gingerly and ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eye over the corners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To his astonishment, he discovered that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had dealt himself four kings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just for the merest phase of an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lump came into his throat. He was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cry out with joy. It was only a flash,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, and he regained his composure be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the other four players had examined</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anderson picked up the pack and called,</seg><seg type="columnLine">" Cards.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the players chucked his hand in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the discard and passed. Another called for</seg><seg type="columnLine">three cards, and Anderson knew that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing to a pair. The third hesitated a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time, and then called for one card, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so Anderson naturally surmised that he want-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed to fill out a flush. Then he looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Logan, and Logan simply said, "Two."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " He's got three of a kind and is trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to draw the fourth," said Anderson to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. "But this time I've got him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He picked up his own hand and scanned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the edges again. He would call for one card</seg><seg type="columnLine">for himself. He knew that he could not give</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself any advantage by so doing, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might lead the other players to think that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was drawing, to a flush. If he stood pat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would surmise that he had a big hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, perhaps, stay out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So, when he said, " The dealer takes one,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of the players went into the discard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This left Anderson, Logan, and a third man</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the game. It was up to the third man to</seg><seg type="columnLine">open the betting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Guess it's worth a ten," said this indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vidual, as he threw a shining ten-dollar piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the center of the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Raise you ten," said Logan, throwing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a twenty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " And ten more," said Anderson, taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">six five-dollar pieces from his pile and</seg><seg type="columnLine">placing them with the rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Be it known, in Lagunitas chips were</seg><seg type="columnLine">never used. For sundry and obvious reasons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was "cash on the table." That was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inevitable, the unalterable rule. Each player</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his own banker. If lie hadn't the " color "</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him, then there was no need of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">"sitting in;-" and, once in a game, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no credit when a player went broke. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was for him to quit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anderson's raise was a staggering blow to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the third man. He seemed to waver between</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope and despair for a minute, and then said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll come in," as if he were sorry. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed twenty dollars on the table as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully expected never to see it again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll raise it twenty-five," said Logan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">throwing in the necessary cash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And twenty-five more," responded An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der;on, as he counted out his fifty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the third man threw his into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">discard and pushed back his chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " See you and raise you fifty," said Logan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " And fifty more," replied Anderson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And make it another fifty," continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">Logan, as lie counted out the coin without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Hold on, I ain't got fifty," said Ander-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, as he dug into his pockets. All of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching revea]ed nothing. The fifty that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had put up with Slim Condon as a side</seg><seg type="columnLine">bet was the last money that he had, save what</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay before him, for the game. That had now</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwindled down to the insignificant sum of</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-two dollars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is my limit," said Anderson, count-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out the twenty-two, "unless I can with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw that side bet with Slim."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slim, who had simply been observing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying nothing, looked at Anderson for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ANDERSON'S FOUR KINGS.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ! . *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">97</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, and then said: "I prefer to let it</seg><seg type="columnLine">go as it lays."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me draw down twenty-five of it,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested Anderson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slim didn't move a muscle.

They're</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth it," said Logan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Good. Here, Buck," and Anderson</seg><seg type="columnLine">called to a young miner who was intently</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching the game, "you keep these bets on</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper. We'll lose track of them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Buck sat in as recording secretary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " I'll put up forty head of my two-vear-old</seg><seg type="columnLine">steers," Anderson went on.

His four</seg><seg type="columnLine">kings were as safe and sure as the eternal</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, he didn't want to put up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranch or any part of it unless Logan would</seg><seg type="columnLine">agree to put up the equivalent in something</seg><seg type="columnLine">besides land.

It was no object to him to add any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more acres to his possessions; and, further-</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, there were great unclaimed ranges not</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty miles away where he could graze his</seg><seg type="columnLine">steers at will, and fifty miles is only an easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaunt in the vast Western region that claimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lagunitas as its center.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell you what I'll do," said Anderson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at his four kings to see if a fifth had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not silently slipped in while the betting was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going on--" tell you what I'll do. I'll put up</seg><seg type="columnLine">my ranch against anything you've got, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">land."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " 'Cept land ?

Back of it was a long, level field of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some twenty acres, surrounded by shady oaks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In its center there had been erected a twentv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">four-foot elevation of plain pine boards, ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">propriately roped in, and on this historic</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform some of the greatest fistic encounters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the town had taken place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">ANDERSON'S FOUR KINGS.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">99</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The news of the Anderson-Logan bout</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread with the rapidity of a frontier flame.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before it was fifteen minutes old, the news</seg><seg type="columnLine">had begun to spread. In an hour most every</seg><seg type="columnLine">man and woman in Lagunitas knew it; by</seg><seg type="columnLine">night and die next morning, it had reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the near-by camps. In consequence, the crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to gather early the next morning, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">long before the appointed hour some twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">acres of humanity--men, women, and chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren--were jostling one another for vantage</seg><seg type="columnLine">spots on the sward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Logan slept that night as never he slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. He resolved that the meeting with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the champion was not going to bother him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though Anderson had vanquished even-- man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had stood before him, perhaps, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">parlance recently produced at Reno, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">"couldn't come back." At any rate, it wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">Logan's style to lose his head or worry. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would stand before the giant and take his</seg><seg type="columnLine">medicine like the man he was, and, if he lost,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would say good-by to Lucy and wish her</seg><seg type="columnLine">well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for Lucy, she had nothing to say in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter. It had long been the Lagunitas</seg><seg type="columnLine">method to fight for a woman, and it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride of the Lagunitas women to be pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in their society as the chosen one of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pugilistic victor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lucy took it philosophically. She had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt that Anderson would land a wallop on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Logan's jaw that would drop the smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, and, with this in mind, she was pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared to accept the inevitable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the moment she was the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">attraction. Many from the neighboring camps</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had never set eyes on her, came around</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the little house where she passed her hum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drum life with her parents, just to "take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">peek," as they expressed it. Born eighteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">years before in Kentucky, she had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought to the camp with the rush of gold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seekers. She was a comely girl, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackest of raven locks and a wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile and the most bewitching black eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For miles around she was the belle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That is why Anderson, who had shunned</seg><seg type="columnLine">all women, wanted to claim her for his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To do Anderson justice, he slept, too. Both</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were awake early and both walked down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the cool, fast-flowing creek about a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">from town and cavorted in its invigorating</seg><seg type="columnLine">water till the blood tingled and the appetite</seg><seg type="columnLine">was put on raVor-edge. Then each went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his home, ready for the frying bacon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">eggs and the steaming coffee, which never</seg><seg type="columnLine">taste so good as on the plains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the respective breakfasts of the con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">testants had been put away, it lacked just one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour of ten o'clock. Just what filled out this</seg><seg type="columnLine">space of time is unnecessary here, save that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Logan smoked his pipe and counted over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">newly-acquired riches,.and Anderson chewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a mouthful of plug tobacco and wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">how he was going to start all over again to</seg><seg type="columnLine">regain new wealth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both men entered the ring promptly on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment. There was no array of train-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers and ring-attendants; there-were no fancy</seg><seg type="columnLine">trunks and highly-colored bath-robes; there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no buckets of water, no sponges, no bell</seg><seg type="columnLine">to toll off the seconds when one or the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to the floor; there was no referee to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men within the rules, and count off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatal ten when one of them struck the floor;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and--there were no gloves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No rules governed boxing-bouts in La-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunitas. It was simply a case of fight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight fair--but fight. Foul tactics only ren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered publicly unpopular the man who in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dulged in them. He was liable to be treated</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the contumely that would make life a</seg><seg type="columnLine">burden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anderson was the first to climb the paling</seg><seg type="columnLine">that separated the ring from the crowd. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw off his coat and hat and stood with</seg><seg type="columnLine">bared and brawny arms while the crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheered. In a second later, Logan was also</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside the ropes, hatless and coatless, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeves of his blue shirt rolled up to his arm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pits. In another second, both men had ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced to the ring and were squaring off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anderson looked more than a match for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rival. Big he was, and the strength in</seg><seg type="columnLine">him showed in every movement of his body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bets quickly ran through the crowd. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">odds were ten, fifteen, even twenty to one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Anderson would win. But there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who did not hesitate at the short end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anderson feinted with his right, and Lo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan drew back. Then Logan came to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front with a strong right swiijg, which An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derson ducked, and the smaller man fanned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air in such a manner that it seemed as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had lost his wind. Anderson, quick as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cat, sent a short left to Logan's head, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Logan caught it full on the jaw and stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered. The men holding the "long-end"</seg><seg type="columnLine">bets began saying " I told you so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Logan circled around Anderson with a neat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and agile step. The blow in the jaw had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been felt, and he was a trifle dizzy, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't want to mix it up again until he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little better. Anderson was trying to force</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fighting; that was plain, for once or twice</seg><seg type="columnLine">he rushed at his opponent, but Logan was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too spry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">100</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Land on his right, Andy! " " Go in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slug. Andy!" "He's got no show, Andy!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">were some of the encouraging sentiments</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled at the champion--but there were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheers for Logan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Anderson sparred cleverly until he had his</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in a corner, and then he aimed to plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">a right which would have ended the sport</seg><seg type="columnLine">then and there--had it landed. But Logan</seg><seg type="columnLine">anticipated it and ducked, and as he ducked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right shot up with stupendous force and</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed square on the unprotected proboscis of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Anderson. The champion reeled back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the faces of the crowd turned pale as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small trickle of blood seamed his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anderson gritted his teeth, for he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad. He came at Logan with a terrific rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a well-aimed right, but Logan was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">too keen, and again he ducked and both men</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At short range, Logan managed to land a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few telling body-blows--and to receive a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and as Anderson did not care for this style</seg><seg type="columnLine">of give-and-take fighting, he fairly hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Logan from him, and he struck against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ropes. Logan now knew that his best scheme</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to wear his man out. So long as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do so, he might have a chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, whenever Anderson rushed, Logan took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opposite tactics, and there came a point</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the champion started to end it all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got you now, Tim," he said, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped back several paces and raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Janney fists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on!" answered Tim, and Ander-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son came. He raised both clenched fists in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air and brought them down with the force</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a pile-driver, but again the little man</seg><seg type="columnLine">swerved out of the way. The force of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow weakened the man who delivered it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His intent was to strike Logan on the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and end it, and now he was out of breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Logan rose to his full height and, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the champion was wondering what had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened, he received a rain of sharp, well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">directed blows on his face that sent him stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gering. Before he could come back, Logan</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent in two to his stomach, and Anderson</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubled up and went to his knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he regained his feet he made an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other desperate lunge at Logan, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggering blow met the little man's jaw, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Logan had him going, and he knew it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again and again, he played on Anderson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind, and again and again Anderson landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him. The crowd marveled that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand such punishment. At length Logan</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw an opening. One faultless swing went</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight to the champion's eye and closed it;</seg><seg type="columnLine">another caught him where he feared it most</seg><seg type="columnLine">--in the wind. Anderson swung power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully but futilely, and then a swift one from "</seg><seg type="columnLine">Logan caught his solar plexus so neatly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reeled over and went down on his back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mighty Anderson was vanquished. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had failed to " come back." He lay pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trate for a few minutes; but, according to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the code of Lagunitas, those few minutes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient to count him out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crowd had begun to disperse, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new luminary had appeared in the person of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tim Logan. The " short-enders " were cash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in their bets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Logan, still calm, still the same cool, col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lected individual, reached for his hat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat, put them on, and then assisted the fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">idol to his feet. He held out his hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Anderson took and shook with hearty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling, for out there in Lagunitas no man</seg><seg type="columnLine">could harbor a grudge, even after defeat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the general excitement that followed, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark-haired, dark-eyed Kentucky girl made</seg><seg type="columnLine">her way through the crowd and beamed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most wonderful smile on Tim Logan as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped down from the ring.

They were right</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their conjecture, for, on the morning of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sale, just twenty people lined up in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the auctioneer's stand, and fifteen of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">were recognized as strangers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the previous night Tinklers had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">roped and deliberately carried to the public</seg><seg type="columnLine">square, where he was staked to a tree. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten feet of rope circumscribed his area, but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">goodly supply of oats kept him in decent</seg><seg type="columnLine">temper until the auction was over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't seem to mind the crowd that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered around the auctioneer's stand.

Tom quickly raised his bid</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a dollar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The auctioneer warbled off " Doll-doll-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doll-do-I-hear-the dollaquarter, do-I-hear-the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollaquarter-dolla-dolla-dollaquarter," with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wonderfully indiscernible sing - song of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his calling. Some unknown did bid in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount. The live-stock dealer went over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a close look at Tinklers, then returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and announced, " One dollar and thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">cents."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One-thirty-five," called Tom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's more than I'll give," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">live-stock man, and he elbowed his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the crowd and went his way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In vain did that auctioneer try to raise</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom Tower's bid. He used every artifice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his kind to make some one say " One-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty " even, but there was not a whimper from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowd. He lured every voluble sound in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his system in pronouncing that figure, but to</seg><seg type="columnLine">no purpose. Only the little children present</seg><seg type="columnLine">cared a whit. They liked to hear him say it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally, he changed his tactics. "Look,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladies and gentlemen," he said, gesticulating</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with oratorical nicety, "look at that noble</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal grazing there, and tell me if you ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a more perfect picture of docile decorum!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why, ladies and gentlemen, there is not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">more perfect jackass in all this county.

" he said, raising his mal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let aloft. He hesitated, and repeated very</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, " Going--going." Then he stopped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was one more chance if any one wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to raise the limit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gone!" he shouted. The mallet came</seg><seg type="columnLine">down with a thud. "He's yours, mister,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the auctioneer, turning to Tom; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom, who had the necessary sum ready,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped up and paid, and Tinklers was his--</seg><seg type="columnLine">hide and hoof.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came the rub.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tinklers had to be removed to New Blun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He seemed loath to leave the oats which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been provided to keep him on his good</seg><seg type="columnLine">behavior while the municipality of Nowich</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being enriched by the sale of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was- a small supply left, and Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">took it for granted that it went with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">donkey. So he gathered them into his hat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">let Tinklers have a sniff of them, untied him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started down the road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last that Nowich saw of its trouble was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom in the lead, deftly manipulating the hat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of oats as a decoy, and Tinklers following, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing captive, his ears sticking out a foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">FLAGGING THE DONKEY.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">115</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of him, and some ten feet of good</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch-rope dragging from his neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He followed patiently for about two miles;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he began to wonder if something new</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strange hadn't come into his life. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked Tom over for a moment, then shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">out his nose, humped his back, and emitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">die most piercing bellow that ever penetrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">his new owner's ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then turned his back on Tom, and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat sprightly in the direction of No-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wich. Tom surmised that Tinklers's inten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions weren't honest, so he began to maneuver</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the rope. He was just in time, for Tink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lers had just got into the return motion. Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave the rope a mighty lunge, and the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised Tinklers turned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on!" yelled Tom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tugged at the rope, and Tinklers fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed unconcernedly for about half a mile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly he got the notion in his head that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had better stop. He planted his four hoofs</seg><seg type="columnLine">so firmly in the ground that Tom couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">budge him. Tom tugged and tugged and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed and tugged again, but Tinklers was</seg><seg type="columnLine">his old self. Tom got behind him and tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to push; he caught him by the ears and twist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed them till they must have pained; he tickled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ribs with a whisk of grass--but Tinklers</seg><seg type="columnLine">only stood as adamant as if he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">carved in stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom saw that such tactics were useless, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">he resorted to more diplomatic means. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced the hatful of oats and let Tinklers</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a taste. Then he walked down the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">about fifty feet and shook the hat and called,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Here, Tinklers! Here, Tinklers!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tinklers moved on and got another nibble,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Tom proceeded another fifty feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">used the same demonstration, and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tinklers responded. This scheme of proce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dure was kept going for about half a mile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally, Tom noticed that about one more</seg><seg type="columnLine">bite and the oats would be at an end. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">what ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took in his surroundings, and estimated</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had about five miles yet to go. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rate of a bite of oats for every fifty feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would require about a ton of feed before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reached New Blunden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The oats did give out, but for two laps of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty feet Tom successfully decoyed Tinklers</seg><seg type="columnLine">into believing that the hat did contain some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. However, the third time it failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tinklers brayed his keen dislike at being</seg><seg type="columnLine">fooled, and again turned his head in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of Nowich.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom lured him with bunches of freshly</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked grass and soft words. He called,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tinkle, Tinkle, Tinkle," and snapped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers to add to the enticement--but Tin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">*klers was wise. He wanted oats or he want-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom picked up die rope and put it over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulder. He managed to catch Tinklers</seg><seg type="columnLine">off his guard, and gave him a lunge which</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly took the animal off its feet. The mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentum was in Toni's favor, and it kept so</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some little distance, but Tom could grad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually feel it grow weaker as Tinklers slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">but surely got his feet into the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom tugged and pulled. Ahead, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred or so feet, the double tracks of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Midland Lines crossed the road. "I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">get him over the tracks," quoth Tom to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul, " then I can tie him to the fence-post,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and go to a near-by farm and buy some more</seg><seg type="columnLine">oats."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was nip and tuck between man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast. First one gained ground and then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. The progress was in Tom's favor. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was slow but certain. It was a mighty tussle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was telling on him. He was fast losing</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength, but he felt that he could hold out</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he crossed the track. Tinklers had his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head down and was trying hard for a footing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His tongue hung out and the rope cut cruelly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his neck--but he was game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Finally, the track was reached. It needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a few feet more, however, and there--</seg><seg type="columnLine">not twenty feet away--was the good stout post</seg><seg type="columnLine">to which he would hitch his recalcitrant pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chase while he hustled for more of die decoy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it happened--as it seemed bound to</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen--that the minute Tinklers struck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of the track on which the east-bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">trains passed, he got the best of the tug-of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">war, and came to a full stop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom was all in. He sat down in the mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle of the road and pulled, and the more he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled the less Tinklers budged. The don-</seg><seg type="columnLine">key's feet seemed glued to the boards between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rails. Once Tom slacked on the rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">just the slightest, but this only gave Tinklers</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chance to plant his feet the firmer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There he stood, his ears laid back 011 his</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck, and his long nose pointed directly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toni--and there he stood when die Plymouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rock Limited loomed up in the distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Engineer Dorgan of the Plymouth Rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">spied the obstruction. He was making a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good sixty miles per, and was ten minutes be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind his schedule at that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He didn't want to stop, and he began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound the most fancy score in whistling that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ever heard in that vicinity. Tom fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped behind Tinklers and began to shove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Tinklers was shoveless. He just wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">116</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">be moved. Dorgan tied down the whistle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lever and put on the air. Tom shoved, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jured, kicked, cajoled, and performed other</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunts, first at Tinklers's head, then at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail--but Tinklers had made up his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was only one thing for Dorgan to do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that was to come to a full stop. He ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to Tinklers, jammed down the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped down from his cab, and the conductor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and several trainmen soon joined him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What in the name of Sam Hill do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean by getting that thing on the track just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we were coming along ? " asked Dorgan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom was breathless. He couldn't speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get him off!" shouted Dorgan, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed up to Tinklers and gave him a push.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorgan was not a light-weight, but the man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner in which he rebounded after landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">against Tinklers gave him some assurance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrible plight of poor Tom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " We've got to get him off the track some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how." broke in the conductor. Dorgan's look</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a sufficient answer for so foolish a ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's lift him off," said the fireman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " That's the talk, Billy," said Dorgan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" Come on. All together! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorgan and Billy got at one end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast and Tom and the conductor at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. Two trainmen added their strength at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle, and the sextet began to maneuver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So soon as Tinklers realized that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being propelled against his wishes, he bit and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked and brayed, and his captors were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">for carrying him far. They managed to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">him off the track, however, and they set him</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on all fours just by the cylinder, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head facing in the direction of Nowich.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now let us get out of here," said Dorgan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he and the fireman climbed into the cab.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The conductor gave the sign, and Dorgan</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the throttle. A long, hot spray shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">out from the exhaust as the drivers turned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It hit Tinklers squarely, and all the pent-up</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy of his stubborn soul was suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">exerted in a desire to run.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If he had been shot from a cannon he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't have made greater speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We certainly got him going," said Billy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Dorgan, as he w'atched Tinklers hoofing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it along the pike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If we could go that fast for the next fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles, we'd make up all we've lost," answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorgan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Tom was almost speechless. He sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">011 a tie hoping that Tinklers would stop, but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for once, there w'as evidently no stop in Tink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That donkey was a lemon," Tom finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, as he rose and turned his steps in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of New Blunden.

When he stepped off the street with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out warning at the end of a board fence, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed, expecting a walk of some distance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but fetched up within ten feet at the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a steep, rickety flight of stairs that led</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a sheer precipice almost a hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Man-Made Chasm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Below was a vast hole several times as long</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it was wide, that had been blown in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid rock.

Later</seg><seg type="columnLine">I discovered that it was one of the smallest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cuts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just beyond was one deeper and longer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on either end were others much longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not quite so deep.

The side nearest the cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been exposed for many feet. Moorshead</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained that it was connected with the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Here," I asked incredulously--" right</seg><seg type="columnLine">alongside the cut?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Yes, and almost under it," he explained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" At most, there is only eighteen feet of rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">between.

I tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, we needed good men, and we had them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The original intention of the Erie had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">to blow a cut straight through Bergen Hill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">regardless of expense, but it proved to be im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible. The hill was covered with houses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was crossed by a number of important</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughfares, including the Hudson Boule-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vard. It would have meant the tying up of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all traffic except for occasional makeshift</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridges, and this Jersey City refused to per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Blasting Down to the Old Tunnel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it became necessary to blow the cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">without disturbing the streets above it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which could be done in only one way. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">course was finally decided upon, in spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gigantic expense involved, and four of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main streets were left untouched, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnels under them were blasted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Walking back and forth in the tunnel, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he directed the men, Moorshead explained to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me how the work had been accomplished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hill was attacked from many points</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once, and holes were immediately sunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixty to eighty feet to get the slow tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">work under way as soon as possible. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">first peckings did not amount to much, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the populace of Jersey City Heights walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one hole to another with undisguised</seg><seg type="columnLine">contempt. But before long there were dyna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mite shocks that brought in some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">householders with claims for fallen plaster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came the huge derricks beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">holes to lift out rock in pieces weighing tons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and improvised tracks for work-trains. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time on, to the people of Jersey City</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heights, it was merely a matter of how much</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper the holes were going to be; but to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men on the job there were other troubles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cold figures give only a partial, idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such an undertaking. The cut completed is</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty-four hundred feet long, with a road-bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty-eight feet wide, making the road-bed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnels wider by eight feet than in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other railroad tunnel. The next widest is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel under Tenth and Eleventh Avenues,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading from the tubes under the North River</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the Pennsylvania Railroad depot in New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York City.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Altogether there were removed five hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREATEST RAILROAD CUT.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">127</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dred thousand cubic yards of blue trap-rock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the meanest kinds of stone to handle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and one hundred and sixty thousand cubic</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards of dirt. To do this required two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and fifty thousand pounds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamite, and, when it was safe, charges</seg><seg type="columnLine">containing as high as one hundred and fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds were exploded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In sinking the original line of blasts, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">holes were all on the far side of the proposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut, as remote as possible from the old tunnel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was in constant use. The nearer the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work approached the old tunnel, the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful it had to be done. Its progress was</seg><seg type="columnLine">slower and infinitely more difficult than if</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been no old tunnel to worry about;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the tunnel was there, and a single piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rock dislodged from its roof might mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bad wreck. There were often heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasts almost over the tunnel, but it was never</seg><seg type="columnLine">seriously disturbed, however, and the trains</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran through it in safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To know just how much dynamite could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be used without endangering the tunnel was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the most important problems that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">builders had to face. Many men had a hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this, but the one who did the most pains-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking work, and did it without causing</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble, was John F.

His information on all</seg><seg type="columnLine">things relating to blasting is wide and exact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blit he needed every bit of it when he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing away rock by the ton within twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet of the roof of the old tunnel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the tunnel had been higher than the cut,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would have been less trouble, but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnel lower, and the downward shock</seg><seg type="columnLine">from dynamite, even with the greatest care,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some rock was bound to become loose in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof of the tunnel. To see that this did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause trouble required constant attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dynamiting periods were selected to</seg><seg type="columnLine">correspond to the times when there was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">least traffic, and what little traffic there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to be hastened, or delayed until after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof had been inspected. Such periods on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy road were, of course, short, which some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what complicated matters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Trouble was generally expected opposite</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the points where the blasts had been fired,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and warning was always sent before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasts were exploded, indicating the exact po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sition of the blasts. For this purpose the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke-vents served as excellent guides, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could be seen plainly and at once both</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the inside and the outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Death Lurked Overhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as a blasting period arrived, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loads were immediately exploded, usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the smoke from the passage of trains</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had time to clear from the tunnel. Quick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly following the shocks, a car, fitted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a raised platform that permitted careful .in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spection of the roof and walls, was pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the tunnel by an engine which always</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood read}-.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of all the jobs connected with the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the cut, there was none of a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">death-defying nature than that of the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who manned the inspection car.

As they went they also tim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered, except in the case of the second tun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel, which was cut through one piece of rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">so solid that it was not necesssary to sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port the roof in any way until it was time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lay the concrete.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Among the engineers there was some dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pute as to whether this should have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">done, but there appeared to be so little dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger that those who were for speedier work</seg><seg type="columnLine">outvoted die more cautious ones, and it so</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened that 110 one was hurt. After the</seg><seg type="columnLine">concrete was all in place there was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case of each arch a free space of fifty-four</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet through which to run the four tracks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">allow space for the third rails to be used</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the road is electrified.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">When Tony Cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  On the fourth tunnel, however, is the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of unsuccessful work 011 the whole job.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Approaching it on foot from the east, can</seg><seg type="columnLine">be seen a solid - wall of concrete fifty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">high, reaching from the top of the tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">arch to the street above.

Their passengers, seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other trains using the cut, were envious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and loudly and vociferously voiced their</seg><seg type="columnLine">complaint to station-agents, conductors, offi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cials of the company, and the newspapers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that it was necessary to still their clamor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At this time it was late in June, and on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first of July the new and higher rates were</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go into effect. On most of the suburban</seg><seg type="columnLine">roads running out of New York there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good deal of kicking, but the Erie was sha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming its commuters into silence by exhibit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the cut it had made for them. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, meant nothng to those who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still going through the tunnel; so, to put them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a happier frame of mind, their trains had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be run through the cut also before it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to buy the commutation tickets for July.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Cut Used by Six Lines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Six big lines with many branches now run</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the new cut.

On the avowal of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Red Pete that he is not his pal, Anderson is released the next day, but notified to leave town within</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> twenty-four hours. Concealing himself under a seat of a passenger-train, he rides to a small town in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ' western Nebraska. On being discovered by the conductor, he is put off, after receiving harsh treatment</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> at the hands of some of the passengers. Here he is arrested as a tramp by the town marshal, but is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> speedily freed by the squire, who generously gives him ten dollars, recommending him to go to the vil----</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> lage hotel for the night. He is grudgingly given a room, and during the night is awakened by a hand</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> at his throat. A robber, who had witnessed the changing of the squire's bill at the desk that evening,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> has entered his room. The robber escapes and our hero is again penniless. The owner of the hotel</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> befriends him, giving him a job in his kitchen, where he stays until he has sufficient money to take</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> him to #San Francisco. After several days' fruitless search for work, he finally lands a job in a stable,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> but early one morning is shanghaied and finds himself in the hold of a ship outward-bound. The ship</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> is the Molly O Malone, bound for some port in China, where, after loading on coolies, she will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> sail for the South Sea Islands.

A brutal second mate forces the boy to work</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> but he is too feeble. The mate kills him with a blow. Anderson makes such an exemplary sailor that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> he wins the friendship of the Swede, who divulges the mission of the Molly O. Malone, offering</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> him a share in the forthcoming slave trading. Anderson seemingly agrees, but is merely biding his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> time, hoping to avenge the death of the lad. Nearing an island, he induces a quarrel with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> mate, fells him. and jumps overboard and swims for land. After a few futile attempts at shooting,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the captain and mate sail away and Anderson finds himself on a coral reef, about a mile away from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the mainland.

There were fer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tile valleys all about, it seemed, in which all</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner of wonderfully flowering plants</seg><seg type="columnLine">were blossoming amid what seemed to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be well-kept plantations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here and there were the low coconut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thatched dwellings of the natives. To the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right rose the peaks of the mountains until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were completely lost in the clouds, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the left the bluest ocean I had ever seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested without a ripple as the sun glinted</seg><seg type="columnLine">over its surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> W'hat a beautiful place in which to live, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We must have gone some distance beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mile when my guide and keeper turned off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main road and into another more narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shorter that soon led to a gate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This gate opened onto a garden of myriad</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers, strange and fragrant. Along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pebbled path we walked, and finally stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">before a native house, thatched with the ever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">useful coconut palms, in style and finish per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps a little more impressive than any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had seen that morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One step led from the ground to the ve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">randa. As my keeper put his foot thereon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latticed door was opened by a beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">young girl--as charming and soulful a crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture as ever my eyes looked on, and she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come out to greet us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And greet us she surely did. As she smiled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she showed the whitest of snow-white teeth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her eyes lit up with a great wonderment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She held out her hand as she came toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I looked at my keeper, who had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved his hat, and was standing in an atti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude of the most abject obeisance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instinctively, I took her hand and returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">her greeting. She directed the way into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. I entered and she followed. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been my custodian since I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown on these shores of wonder, bowed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he had received his full reward for being</seg><seg type="columnLine">a willing servitor, and went his way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To nly surprise, she spoke a broken Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lish. It was very " broken," and she spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">it very slowly and with great effort--but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could understand her, and it was not much</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble to make her understand me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was very pretty. Her skin was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">most delicate brown, her eyes were piercing</seg><seg type="columnLine">black, large and luminous, and her white</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth, her long black hair, and her finely cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">cameo features, at once attracted my atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. When she stood on lier bare feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">136</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drew her loose-fitting gown around her I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">noticed that, like Rosalind, she "was just as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">high as my heart."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   She called in the most silvery tones, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">two maid servants entered. She gave orders</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which I could not understand, and they dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I was sitting on a wicker-seat, and she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drew another close to mine. Then she asked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me my name, and all about me and my ad-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">- ventures, and just how I happened to be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cast up on die island of Moona--for that was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">just where I happened to be at that particular</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I told her as briefly as possible just what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I had been through, and she listened with all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the eagerness of a child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then I ventured to ask her name, and she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">replied. "Tati,'' with a long sound of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">" a." which gave it a peculiarly pleasant mu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sical tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   She explained that she was more than Tati.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Indeed, she was the Princess Tati, and her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">father, the old King of Moona, lived afar on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the other side of the island, where he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">maintained in limited luxury by the Euro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pean government, which had once overpow-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ered him and was now slowly turning the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Utopia that his forefathers had created and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">handed down to him into the commercial</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">status of modern civilization.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Tati was telling me that this was her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">house, that her grounds were outside, and all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that nature brought forth thereon was hers,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and hers alone. Frequently she went to visit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her father and mother and sisters, and fre-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">quently they came to visit her. She loved</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her island home, she said, and cared little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for the great lands that lay beyond its shores;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and if all the men were like the officers of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the regiments that policed the island--who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">never failed to insult her--then she was glad</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she was a daughter of the tropics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   While she chatted on, telling all about her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">island and the people, the maid servants en-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tered with a tray of food and spread it on a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cloth of green leaves, which they laid on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">floor. These islanders never dined from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tables.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was a great dish of wild grapes,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there was an omelet sprayed with some savory</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sauce, there was breadfruit in several forms,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there were tiny fishes, and there were two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bowls of the most savory coffee that I ever</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   She sat on the floor in the posture known</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on our land as "tailor fashion," and bade</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me do likewise. I couldn't take the position</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as easily as she did, but I managed to make</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">myself comfortable, and she pointed to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowl of coffee and bade me taste it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " It is delicious," I told her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, try a fish," she said, always smi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked at me queerly as I lifted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">morsel of the food to my mouth.

But Tati</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate it relishingly, and explained as she did</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that her people never cooked fish; that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters of the sea were so pure and the fish</seg><seg type="columnLine">so fine they were preferred raw. A sauce of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lemon and grated coconut added to their fla-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vor and destroyed the taste of oil in the finny</seg><seg type="columnLine">one's flesh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before the breakfast had gone further I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found myself reaching for another fish, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tati beamed on me as I did so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was my friend; that was plain, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">realizing that, it was my turn to'ask her some</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Princess Tati," I said, "won't you tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me why I was locked up last night?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Were you r.ot comfortable?" she asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in return.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Quite," I replied, " but I must admit</seg><seg type="columnLine">that at first I was a bit frightened.

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning I was awakened by a rustling at</seg><seg type="columnLine">my side, and there stood my old friend the</seg><seg type="columnLine">native who had so carefully locked me up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first night of my " arrival."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shall always refer to him as my "keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er"; and, although he told me that his name</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Akipo, I generally said "Keep" when-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever I spoke to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, Akipo bore the glad tidings of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">august mistress and several pieces of cloth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The latter, I soon learned, were a small white</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt common to all lands, and a square of</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored print about four feet each way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This, Akipo explained by many a ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, was the native garment, and that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wear it. He was dressed in the regula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion way he showed me, and I examined his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes and prepared to dress likewise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The shirt was very easy to get into" it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn the same way the world over--but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">four feet square of print was something quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">new.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Akipo took his off and put it on several</seg><seg type="columnLine">times to instruct me. The scheme was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply wrap it around the waist and tuck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edges into some sort of an impossible knot</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would stay put until die wearer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to retire for the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once fastened, the cloth hung from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist after the manner of a skirt. I realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once that it was a very comfortable form</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dress for tropical wear, and it seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">match my complexion and fill other phases of</seg><seg type="columnLine">importance, but--I simply could not manage</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tie that wonderful knot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whenever I donned the cloth and knotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">it about my waist and walked about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, it would come untied. Akipo patiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjusted his a dozen times with the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelous dexterity. He showed me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">that famous knot could not come undone if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it were only fastened properly--and I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It took skill and endurance, however. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally mastered it, and of all the surprises</seg><seg type="columnLine">that have come to me since the day I swam</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashore on this tropical isle, that knot was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most mysterious and the most wonderful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Breakfast was almost ready, and Akipo</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the knot for me. I was sure of it when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did the work, and when I appeared before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the princess in my new garb I feared no</seg><seg type="columnLine">unseemly mishap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tati had the feast of the morning spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">on leaves that she plucked herself from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrub in the garden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was the raw fish and the fruit and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coffee; and this morning, in order to toast</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves and our future, she had made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">daintiest beverage of coconut water and</seg><seg type="columnLine">limes and the essence of an herb that grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her garden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She poured it into a coconut-shell, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAN WHO WASN'T GAME.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">139</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wished me every joy as she drank.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">went up to the horse and patted his neck.

There he</seg><seg type="columnLine">identified the body, and, as the commissioner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of police had put the entire matter in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands of Tracie, he found it part of his duty</seg><seg type="columnLine">to notify the dead man's wife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This pleasant detail even the detective dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liked, but he knew that Jimmie would be just</seg><seg type="columnLine">the person.

There was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing unusual in his voice that startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blander.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In a moment "Brown" Taber had</seg><seg type="columnLine">whipped out a knife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In another moment he had sprung at Blan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der. In another, Blander was forced against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall by the powerful thug, and as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised his hands to heave--either in fright or</seg><seg type="columnLine">mute appeal, "Brown" brought the knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">across his throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blander went down in a heap, striking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table. Taber put out his mighty arm to</seg><seg type="columnLine">break the fall, for he didn't want any sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be heard outside. Blander landed on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table just as the police found him. Death</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to him quickly. There is no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in such moments the shock and surprise</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">caused by fright adds greatly to relieve the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The one and only thing that Taber want-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed--the four thousand dollars in small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily passed bills--was now his. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never taken the commission of the crime pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed by the dead man seriously; but "if</seg><seg type="columnLine">this old guy," as he said to himself, " is com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing around with four thousand in good</seg><seg type="columnLine">American casj). I'm not going to pass him</seg><seg type="columnLine">by."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I'll get it if I have to kill him," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">" Brown " to himself that night, just before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he and Blander had entered the saloon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Realizing that the man was dead, Taber</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once began his plan of escape. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrewd and well thought out. He had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, and he was going to some country</seg><seg type="columnLine">afar, where his face was unknown. He w'as</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired of the humdrum of the East Side, w'here</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was pointed out as the most prominent</seg><seg type="columnLine">crook within its borders to every slumming</seg><seg type="columnLine">party that happened along. Now he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacate for good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once he thought of his mother. Mother!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mother! Dear, good, kind little mother, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never deserted him! What would she</seg><seg type="columnLine">do? She had begged him not to--he drew a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand across his eyes, for he wanted to blur</seg><seg type="columnLine">her from his mind just then. Perhaps when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was settled in the new land she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to him--if--the shock didn't kill her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But this was no time for sentiment. Moth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er or no mother, he must get out of that room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The criminal is a criminal always. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">is bred in the bone cannot be eliminated from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mind. Lombroso, that great Italian who</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoted his whole life to a scientific study</seg><seg type="columnLine">of such men as "Brown" Taber, tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell just why a thief is always a thief. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact is, he can't help it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is born in him. He must steal, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same principle that lie must eat. He must</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill, on the same principle that he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathe. The holiest sentiments of mother,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wife, of family, will not stay his hand a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, once the idea seizes him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brown Taber looked around the room. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked on the dead man, lying there very</seg><seg type="columnLine">still. He put the money in his pocket, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he went through the clothing of the dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">and removed every vestige of paper that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would possibly serve as a clue to identifica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He even tore the initials from the dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's hat, and pulled a signet-ring from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger. Taber didn't want to leave the slight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est trace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he turned the light very low. Ta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">PRESIDENT OF THE LINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">185</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">king the tray on which Joe Smith had served</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drinks, he stepped over to the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened it very cautiously about two inches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked steadily at Smith and at the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the bar. There were about a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">present, but finally all departed but four</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, who with Joe Smith made five.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of them began a story, and the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned over the bar. As it progressed in in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest their heads bent lower, and they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">oblivious to all else. At what seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the psychological moment, Taber opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door a little wider and sent the tin tray</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashing against the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It landed with a loud clang and rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the floor. Just as " Brown " expected,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith and the five men hastened over to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As they did so, he slipped out and into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It all happened in the flash of a moment--</seg><seg type="columnLine">oh, he knew so well just how the men would</seg><seg type="columnLine">act, and how much time he would have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the street!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One turn of his head, and it might all be</seg><seg type="columnLine">over. He stepped onto the sidewalk just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if nothing had happened. He walked along</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the Bowery as if he were on some or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinary errand. No one would have thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was an escaping murderer with four</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand dollars in his pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Only one of my trays," said Smith. " It</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have fallen off the table. Come back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bar."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Gee, but it made some noise," said one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the men--and that was all that was said</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the incident then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shortly after Smith had proved his inno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cence and promised to testify if ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Brown" Taber was caught--when he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">free to go back to his " joint " again--he fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quently wondered if that tray had really fall-</seg><seg type="columnLine">en from the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " If ' Brown ' used that business in his get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">away," he frequently said, " then he is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">better crook than I expected. It was a pret-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty slick piece of work. And there were we</seg><seg type="columnLine">guys rubberin' at the tray, and ' Brown '</seg><seg type="columnLine">sneakin' out of the door. I wonder how much</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took off the fellow, anyhow ? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When "Brown" Taber reached the Bow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">en', he started north. He arrived at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grand Central Station in time to catch a</seg><seg type="columnLine">train for Chicago. Once in that city, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">"planted" himself with a bunch of thieves</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom he knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were all glad to see him. and glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know that he had pulled off a successful</seg><seg type="columnLine">"trick." But after they began to read the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">papers, and to realize that " Brown " must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have " landed " pretty well, thev all wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">a "bit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He began to see that if he made a " divvy,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would be minus the greater part of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll, and then there was the trouble of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">"dishonest" crook squealing to the police</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ending his freedom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Above all, there was that place in the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known land, where he could pose as a decent</seg><seg type="columnLine">man and--send for mother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he started out anew. This time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck out for the Northwest. Notwithstand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the fact that the police of every State</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on the lookout for him, and his picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been brought to light in every rogues'</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallery, he managed to evade the sleuths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  With great skill he crossed the frontier,</seg><seg type="columnLine">journeyed into Canada, and at Vancouver</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the steamer for Australia, traveling in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steerage as a miner bound for the gold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diggings in the western part of that faraway</seg><seg type="columnLine">country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a pleasant, invigorating voyage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it gave him time to think. The chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">object of his thoughts was his mother. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered and wondered how she was getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, and he hoped and he prayed that Fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther Flynn would comfort her, and that her</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighbors would not be unkind to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But what if the police should-molest her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking that she knew where he was? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">what if the landlord should have her ejected</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of the notoriety?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He buried his face in his hands. No, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not think such thoughts. The journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">would soon be over, and he could send for</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother. Then she would come to him quiet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly and alone, and he would give her a home</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which she would be proud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The long sea trip was over, and one day</seg><seg type="columnLine">" Brown " found himself in the beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">harbor of Sydney. He went ashore, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon knew that he would like the rolonial</seg><seg type="columnLine">city. It was a very sprightly place, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people all seemed happy, and it looked very</seg><seg type="columnLine">much like the American cities to which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been accustomed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Here he would settle. He found work, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gloried in the joy of honest labor for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time in his life. He remained sober and</seg><seg type="columnLine">banked his stolen money. He didn't want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to invest it until mother came, for he wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to help him put it where it would do the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After three months of the first honest life</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had ever known, he sat down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrote to her. The note was couched in</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain and simple language. He didn't want</seg><seg type="columnLine">186</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell her too much. It simply said " Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me," and it was unsigned, but mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">would understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waited and waited for an answer. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited and waited, and every time that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamer arrived from faraway America, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would go to die wharf and scan the faces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoping to see the dear, sweet smile of mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she leaned over the taffrail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But modier never came.

Railroad Max's Magazine :</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN your July number you published an article on</seg><seg type="columnLine">train-despatching by telephone. I believe some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the statements therein are erroneous. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">article states that the telephone minimizes the</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger of mistakes in the transmission and receipt</seg><seg type="columnLine">of train orders. In the Morse code of telegraph,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each and every letter is distinctly different. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken through a telephone the letters "b," "c,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"d," "c," " g," "p," "t," "v," and "z" sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">very similar, and. in many cases, it is very diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult to distinguish between them. On this I base</seg><seg type="columnLine">my claim that the telegraph is safer than the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now in regard to speed. The articlc says that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a despatcher using the telegraph has his speed re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricted to accord with the receiving ability of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the operators. I cannot see that he is rid of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">restriction where the telephone is in use. A first-</seg><seg type="columnLine">class operator can copy a telegraphic order just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast as he can write. Can he do more with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">telephone? I know of one despatcher now using</seg><seg type="columnLine">the telephone who claims he can handle three tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graphic orders in the same time he uses for one</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the telephone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The article claims that on one road, during two</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of train-despatching by telephone, not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single accident was caused by mistakes in train</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders. I fail to see anything remarkable about</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. On the road which employs me, I cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">recall an accident caused by a mistake in the trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission or receipt of telegraphic train orders, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the past seven years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">If the telephone is to take the place of the tele-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">graph, it will not be for the sake of safety, but to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reduce expenses.--A'.
