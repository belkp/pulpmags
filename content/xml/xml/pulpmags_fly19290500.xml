Jims changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind because of an ad of a Flagstaff company which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw in an Arizona paper. It announced an air-transpor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation service to the Great Rainbow Natural Bridge in</seg><seg type="columnLine">southern Utah. Jims left the train during the night and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a hotel. His two best buddies in the war had come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arizona and had never tired of telling him of the wonders of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that state. But Jims' acquaintance with Arizona had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the car windows of the Transcontinental Limited. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that those two buddies were from Flagstaff might sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciously have had something to do with Jims' sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">whim to stop off, but he did not realize it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He arose early the following morning with a strange ner-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vous eagerness. While breakfasting, he decided to scout</seg><seg type="columnLine">around to see if he could locate those former buddies. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have continued to drift about the country as he had,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since returning from the war. The war had done strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">things to Jims. He was nearly always broke, drifting about</seg><seg type="columnLine">from job to job with the various air-transportation com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panies. For a year following the war he had piloted mail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jims discovered that Flagstaff was not very large; a vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lage, he thought, after a survey of the few narrow streets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coke Airfield was out by the park. Jims soon came to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conclusion that he had made a bad bet in stopping off, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air company whose ad he had read and with whom he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had hoped to get a job, probably did not have more than one</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two planes. At the worst, he might be able to get a job</seg><seg type="columnLine">as grease monkey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jims went back to the lobby of the hotel to wait until busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness hours began. He took a seat near the window and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been there but a few minutes when he saw a tall, lanky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">youngish-oldish looking man coming down the street and</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized him as his former buddy, Fred Murphy. Fred</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murphy's daring in smashing balloons, ringed about with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the famous nests of German Archies had won for him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">title of "Balloon Buster." Murphy had been an ace among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"DROCK JIMS rushed out to the street and up to Murphy</seg><seg type="columnLine">with outstrctchcd hand. Murphy stopped in surprise. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile broke his features as he recognized his former pal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jims noticed right away that Murphy had changed much.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But in his blue eyes and about his lips was that same expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion that almost all flyers had worn during those red days</seg><seg type="columnLine">when men were coming down like flies; when a man's life</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air was measured in minutes. Brock Jims, Fred</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murphy, Tom Whitlock and Ared Jones, all in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">squadron, had been unusually lucky. The Armistice had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found all four still able to take the air. Ared Jones had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been cashiered from the Army following the cessation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">war. There was a rather bad story behind him. All four</seg><seg type="columnLine">had flown together, but Jones had never been accepted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others as a friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello!

Think I could get a job?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Murphy started suddenly, and then to Jims' surprise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up and down the street furtively. "It is a large out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fit," Murphy said, speaking hurriedly. "I'm working there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Block. And say, if you want a job go up there right away</seg><seg type="columnLine">and apply. I happen to know they want another flyer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The tourist business to Rainbow Natural Bridge is picking</seg><seg type="columnLine">up.

I'll ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain all this the first chance I get you alone." Murphy</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to go, but paused and flung from the corner of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth: "Tom Whitlock is chief deputy sheriff here in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flagstaff."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jims hurried into the hotel. Murphy went on down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street. Jims was puzzled but he knew Murphy had some</seg><seg type="columnLine">good reason. His manner had been one of worry and grave</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. "There's something up all right," muttered Jims.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Dang glad I stopped over. And so Tom is chief deputy</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff? Hmmm, I wonder what connection he has with</seg><seg type="columnLine">all Murphy's mystery?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jims found Coke Airport nestling among the tall pines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the towering, white-capped San Francisco peaks above.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The field was rather large and in much better condition than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he expected to find in such a small place as Flagstaff. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the west side were a number of small hangars and two planes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the east were long hangars and other buildings above</seg><seg type="columnLine">which hung a sign announcing that this was The Rainbow</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bridge Transportation Company. Beneath this in small</seg><seg type="columnLine">lettering was the name of Dick Richards, prop. To Jims'</seg><seg type="columnLine">further surprise, in front of the hangars at the proper dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance, a long white line ran the length of the field. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thing brought back with a jolt the war days. Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge planes were on this dead-line, mechanics working on</seg><seg type="columnLine">them busily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER a few minutes of conversation with a man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood by looking on, Jims learned that this was a live</seg><seg type="columnLine">wire company. They owned seven planes now and contem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plated adding five more, if the tourist business continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">picking up. Sightseers who wished to visit the Bridge were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not at all lacking. The Rainbow Bridge Transportation Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany had made a landing field close to the Natural Bridge in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Utah at considerable expense; and the trip could now be</seg><seg type="columnLine">made comfortable by air. It cost a figure less than when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural wonder could be visited only by pack train, and in far</seg><seg type="columnLine">less time, as the trip by air required but a few hours. If they</seg><seg type="columnLine">so desired, tourists could go and return in the same day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Most of them, however, stayed several days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A grease monkey pointed out the superintendent's office</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Jims. In a few minutes he was facing Charlie Kruger</seg><seg type="columnLine">across a polished desk. The blond giant, blue-eyed, weighing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                     7</seg><seg type="columnLine">8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Flying Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">over two hundred pounds, looked Jims over coolly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded at his question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We need another flyer now. Flew in the war didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?" Kruger asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," returned Jims. "Flew mail for a year and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">just been knocking about the country since. Think I'd like</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stick here a while. Here are any discharge papers you</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Any special reason why you'd like a job here?" Kruger</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said Jims, and was on the point of saying he had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">job waiting in St. Louis, but thought better of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kruger turned away and Jims rather thought the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was smiling to himself. Still no definite expression ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From outside came the roar of a plane. Kruger had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been shuffling some papers on the desk. Now he turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jims, and the smile which Jims had merely suspected was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his lips. Deep in Kruger's blue eyes Jims saw much. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">those eyes lurked the spirit of a man who went through</seg><seg type="columnLine">life with one fixed purpose. And in the pools of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes lay something sinister, deep. Kruger would be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard, merciless enemy, a dangerous man in a fight. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jims knew that Kruger would use every means that came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his hands to gain his end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"V'ES," Kruger was saying, "You are hired now. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than glad to get you. Now there is much you must</seg><seg type="columnLine">know about these trips to the Rainbow Natural Bridge and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tourist business. It's more than a business, it's an art.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll send you to Utah on the next ship taking off so that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">may learn the landmarks and the way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Kruger paused, the office door was opened and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried a tall, well-built, curly-headed man. Jims stiffened</seg><seg type="columnLine">at sight of him, for it was Tom Whitlock. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">deputy sheriff's star in evidence. He looked at Jims and</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight through him without a sign of recognition. Jims</seg><seg type="columnLine">took his cue immediately and acted likewise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whitlock went to the railing before Kruger's desk. "Hello</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charlie, how's the dude business?" was his greeting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kruger's movements when he turned to face Whitlock</seg><seg type="columnLine">were like those of a big cat about to leap on its prey. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely nodded in salutation. Whitlock turned abruptly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jims.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you doing in Flagstaff?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jims looked at Whitlock for a moment. In the latter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, he read a message that Tom was trying to get over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know that that's any of your business!" snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jims with some heat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whitlock laughed. "I'm the deputy sheriff."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, what the hell do I care who you are?" said Jims</seg><seg type="columnLine">rudely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kruger was watching this byplay with a half smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe I didn't show my meaning plain enough," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitlock. "It's like this, I wasn't asking you officially, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">actly. You see, the hotel clerk where you stayed last night</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a friend of mine. He knew we were looking for a pilot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The county officials are taking to the air after cattle rustlers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other crooks now. We've bought a plane. All we need</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a pilot. You told the hotel clerk you were a flyer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked the location of Coke field. Well, I rushed right up</seg><seg type="columnLine">here in case Kruger here didn't hire you, so you wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">get away. How about it, want a job?" Then turning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kruger, "I'm not butting in, you understand, Charlie. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have already hired this man I'm withdrawing my offer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again Kruger turned with the movements of a big cat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his smile was questioning. "I've already hired this man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why don't you fly the plane yourself, Whitlock?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jims saw that Whitlock was startled for the moment but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he covered it up quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Charlie, I could but I am going to be might}' busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping up the chief deputy's end of the job. You see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sheriff Bradbum is going to retire some day. And who</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows, I might want to be the sheriff of Coconino County."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kruger laughed easily. "I might fire a man for you," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "If I do I'll send him over to see you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That will be kind of you, Charlie. Well, I must be going</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. If a stray pilot does show up send him over to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff's office, will you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kruger watched Whitlock, catlike, until he had closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door behind him. He was explaining further the duties</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would be required of Jims, when Murphy came in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He hardly noticed Jims, threw no more than a casual glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "McMullen said you wanted to see me," he said to Kruger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I did, yes," said Kruger. "You're fired I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment of silence in the office. Then Murphy smiled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jims knew that smile of old. He has seen Murphy smile in</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly that manner when once he climbed out of the wreck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age of his smashed plane in Flanders. He smiled in just</seg><seg type="columnLine">that same way when he rushed into fight against overwhelm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing odds in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can't fire me," he told Kruger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I can't, can't I?" said Kruger. "Hike right over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the quarters and start packing up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I said you can't fire me." Murphy was still smiling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And you can't. Just call up Dick Richards and you'll find</seg><seg type="columnLine">out why. He told me to tell you that in case you ever did</seg><seg type="columnLine">try it. Besides that, I don't like you, Kruger. For seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars and a half I'd punch your nose right here!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kruger went red with rage. He jerked the phone toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, held it a moment in doubt and then flung it from him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stood up and wheeled toward Murphy. Such rage as</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpled Kruger's face Jims had never seen before! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in his anger was drawing himself up with squared</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders. His eyes flashed hate. It struck Jims that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kruger was certainly a man of military experience. Neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the other two saw Jims rise quietly and approach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just when they were upon the point of flying at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other's throats, Kruger abruptly resumed control of him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. "Forget it, Murphy," he said shortly. "Get into flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">togs and take out that party of three at nine o'clock."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murphy laughed harshly. Jims wondered what kept Mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phy from tearing into Kruger. He knew the fighting Irish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man of old. But both men seemed to be drawing away</seg><seg type="columnLine">warily; keeping an armed truce.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some of these days, Kruger, I'm going to take you apart</seg><seg type="columnLine">and see what makes your face get so red when you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad," said Murphy turning on his heel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kruger stared at the floor a minute after Murphy left</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he spoke again his voice was brisk and sharp, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner of an officer of the old school giving orders. "Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the idea that I'm not the boss around here," he said. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am. Richards is rather too sentimental toward his flyers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Because Murphy was the first pilot here, we must let him</seg><seg type="columnLine">have his own way. But one of these days soon Murphy is</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to get his, or else Richards will find himself without</seg><seg type="columnLine">a superintendent!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TZ'RUGER went to the door and opened it, pointing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back of a man in flying togs standing near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane warming up on the line. "That is McMullen. Go out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and introduce yourself. Tell him I said to show you the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner room in the quarters next to the hangars."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jims went out to the line and paused beside the pilot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are McMullen?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am. What do you want?" said the pilot turning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jims looked squarely into the pilot's face then. He got</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in hand with an effort, for this man who called</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself McMullen now, was the pilot, Ared Jones, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been cashiered from the service almost ten years before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jims saw immediately that Jones knew him, and that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was waiting to see if Jims had recognized him. The years</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done much to change Jones. Where once his hair had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a deep brown, it was now red. The odd-looking red</seg><seg type="columnLine">that henna gives to the hair. In a moment Jones looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">relieved, for Jims gave no sign he had recognized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgraced former pilot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Above the Rainbow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">9</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kruger said you'd show me the corner room next to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hangars in the quarters," said Jims evenly. "I'm a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot who just got on this morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wondering greatly at the swift succession of surprises,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jims followed McMullen to the pilot's quarters, close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main hangar. McMullen showed him the room, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">large, airy and well-furnished. He excused himself on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plea of business and left Jims alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TIMS phoned for his bag and trunk. He spent the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">v the morning overhauling his flying gear and settling his</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. At noon he went to the mess hall which adjoined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cook shack. All the pilots and mechanics ate at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">mess. Both Murphy and McMullen were absent and Jims</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned from the others that they probably would not get</seg><seg type="columnLine">in until after nightfall, as they had taken out parties of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tourists to the Rainbow Bridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kruger sent for Jims during the afternoon and took him</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the hangars. He was assigned a big H. V. ship and</seg><seg type="columnLine">given a grease monkey and a mechanic. In five minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone with his ground crew, Jims ascertained that the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Transportation Company hangars were equally di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided in likes and dislikes for Kruger. McMullen appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be Kruger's only close friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dat McMullen and de Proosian are jist like two peas,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came to the vacant lot, and in the shadows of a sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">board at the curb stood a small, fast roadster. He got in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car and sat down. Presently from a side street came</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitlock walking fast. He climbed in, started the motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the little car went hurrying down a darkened street and</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the open country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By gawd, Jims, talk about being glad to see somebody I</seg><seg type="columnLine">Put her there, old kid!" exclaimed Whitlock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They shook hands. "Say, why all the mystery?" demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jims. "Murphy and you have about finished me off. Honest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm beginning to think this town is full of crazy people!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whew," said Whitlock, "believe me, Murphy and I are</seg><seg type="columnLine">having the time of our lives! Maybe he put it on a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit too strong with you. You see, it's this way. This town</seg><seg type="columnLine">is being overrun with bootleg whisky. Not only that, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody up this way is flooding the whole state! Murphy</seg><seg type="columnLine">is working for us, the sheriff's office, under cover. But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to be common knowledge, for they have tried to kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">him twice. One dark night they slugged him on a side</seg><seg type="columnLine">street And just a week ago another plane tried to run him</seg><seg type="columnLine">down one night when he was coming home from Utah.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We've worked it from every angle and there's just one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. This whisky is coming here in planes, and dien, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some manner, being distributed to various points by trucks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's precious few planes in this country yet And we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jims was hanging low over the canyon country again when the roar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">another ship came to him. He cut the motor and then opened the gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide, zooming. The other ship was close and coming out of the south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment later, a strange singing went across the wings of his plane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jims saw the stabbing flame from a machine-gun as he nosed down with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a power dive. He darted the H.V. up under the other ship and hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">there for a moment. So this pilot was gunning for him! Jims felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old war-time thrill which was quickly dispelled. Here he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly handicapped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Weaponlessl</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">opined the friendly greasehound. "Bot' bad, what I mean!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You mean to say Kruger is a Prussian?" asked Jims</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly. All at once it struck him that Kruger was a Teu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonic name. Was that why Murphy hated Kruger?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Naw, I don't know exactly he is," admitted the grease</seg><seg type="columnLine">monkey. "Some say he talks about fighting wit de Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cans in France. But we calls him de Proosian because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gives orders like one, if you get wot I means?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jims was with the group that gathered about McMullen's</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane as it taxied up to the line at sunset Some of the pi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lots inquired about Murphy and McMullen reported that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had stayed over to bring back a party of tourists about</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon the following day. Jims had hung around after sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per in hope of getting to talk to Murphy, but now that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to wait a while longer he decided to go into</seg><seg type="columnLine">town and see a show. A block from the theater he stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a tobacco shop. When he left the lighted lobby he ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Whitlock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whitlock paused momentarily. "Go down this street to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vacant lot. Get in the car at the curb." Whitlock kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving on as he spoke. Jims said not a word but continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">on down the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">"By golly," he said to himself, "If this keeps up much</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer, I'm going to get the creeps and get 'em bad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">know that there are just two ways the bootleg ring is trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porting their stuff here. Either they have their own plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden away somewhere, which seems more likely since a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship tried to get Murphy in the air; or else they are using</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ship from the Rainbow Transportation Company. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter case Kruger would have to be in with the boot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leggers, and at least three other men at the field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Murphy believes this. He hates Kruger like the devil.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Says he believes Kruger is a German and that he fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">against us in the late lamented war. In some way we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to this bootleg ring, without knowing it, and they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting desperate. Else why two attempts to get Murphy?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, once, another car crashed into me. If I hadn't had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of good luck, they'd have got me right." Whitlock</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove on in silence for a few minutes, then continued:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Murphy was tickled pink you came to Flagstaff, and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spur of the moment he conceived a plan. He hurried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and that's why I went to Kruger while you were there</seg><seg type="columnLine">this morning. We want you to help us out. You must work</seg><seg type="columnLine">under cover. You must not be known to Murphy and me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's the why-for of all the mystery and strange acting!</seg><seg type="columnLine">What do you say?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure I'm with you and Murphy," said Jims. "You knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd help out my old pals. So some bird tried to wash Mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">10</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Flying Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">phy out of the air? Say, Tom, do you know that bird Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mullen at the field is none other than Ared Jones?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We sure do! And we wonder at the change in name</seg><seg type="columnLine">plus a weak attempt at disguise. Say, you didn't let 011 you</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew who he was?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. I took the hint from all this atmosphere of mystery</seg><seg type="columnLine">and didn't let a peep out of me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's fine. We had better be turning around here. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have some official business to attend to tonight. I've given</seg><seg type="columnLine">you a rough story of the case. You and Murphy find out all</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can. Richards is working with us too. He doesn't be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve that a ship from his hangars is doing the dirty work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm not inclined to think so myself, but Murphy does."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitlock slowed down, stopped and backed into a road</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning off. Another car came roaring down the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">highway and swerved past them at furious speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"T)OY, howdy! Those birds must be in an awful hurry!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Whitlock, slipping his car into high. He went into</seg><seg type="columnLine">more details of the rum running then. When two miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">had slipped by, the red rear-light of a car showed up ahead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As they drew closer, they recognized the big touring-car</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had roared past them a few minutes before. The ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine was drawing over to the side, to allow them to pass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jims and Tom saw the shapes of several men as they drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">past. Whitlock pulled down the gas lever and they raced for</seg><seg type="columnLine">town for he did not wish Jims to be recognized while with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The touring-car behind them suddenly came roaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward them at full speed. A bullet sang into the roadster,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed through the windshield with a splintering of glass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed immediately by the sound of a high-powered rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind them. Whitlock reached forward, shut off the lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gave the little car more gas at the same time. The rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's a rifle in a scabbard beneath your feet, Brock,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Whitlock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jims hurriedly got out the rifle and turned backwards in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seat. The lights of the other car were shining full upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. As he drew aim with the rifle the touring-car lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out. Jims fired at that moment. The two cars were</seg><seg type="columnLine">now rushing along the highway toward Flagstaff at a furi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous speed. Both were unlighted. Whitlock was too good a</seg><seg type="columnLine">driver, however, to crack up unless the unforeseen occurred.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Red flame stabbed the night from the touring-car. Instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jims fired again. A hail of lead spattered about the roadster</seg><seg type="columnLine">in answer. The lights of the town appeared abruptly around</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bend. The lights of the touring-car shot on and it swerved</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the highway into a side road and went roaring on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly disappearing over a small hill. Whitlock slowed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roadster down and turned on the lights. The dash board</seg><seg type="columnLine">light showed his face grim and tight-lipped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, how's that for your initiation into the game, eh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brock ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If they had used a Lewis gun, I'd have to pinch myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see if we weren't back in Flanders!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's get to that plane of yours, Tom, and see what we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can discover about that murderous car, from the air."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Exactly my idea, Brock. But you don't go. I'm going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to let you off here on this dark street. I'll hurry to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hangar and get into the air. Chances are, though, that car</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be in hiding some place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jims protested, but got off obediently on a side street.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitlock went speeding toward Coke field and the county</seg><seg type="columnLine">hangar. Jims decided to walk back out to the field. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckled to himself as he went; that hunch of his to stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">over in Flagstaff was bearing good fruit. This bootlegging</seg><seg type="columnLine">business with Murphy and Whitlock was going to settle</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nerves for a while. Nothing like a little excitement to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spice the joy of living!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was still musing over matters when he entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters. He opened the door of his room, only to experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence the sudden feeling that he had been abruptly dumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a lake of cold water. Something was wrong and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew it the moment he had the door open. He closed it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him and moved quickly to one side, halting, waiting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Call it a sixth sense or what you will, Jims knew that danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurked in that darkened room. Minutes ticked away like</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours. The very atmosphere tensed to bursting. Some one</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hiding in his room; some one who had no honest bus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iness being there. A man was in that room with designs</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his well-being. Jims could feel it and wished he had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver. He decided that hereafter he would never be</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught without one. He changed his position carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">and waited. It seemed hours as eyes strained to pierce the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy blanket of darkness, ears listened to catch the slight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pupils of his eyes became accustomed to the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the room. Objects were showing a shade darker</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the blackness. Finally, there came distinctly the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of indrawn breath. Jims felt, rather than saw a large, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinct blurr moving toward him in the dark. For a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, he debated whether to fling himself onto the other in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild rush, or await a decisive movement of the man closing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in on him. He was weaponless and had nothing near his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand which he could use to defend himself. In all likeli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood the other was armed with a gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jims' clenched hand in his pocket came in contact with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal cigarette lighter. He brought it out, held it at arm's</seg><seg type="columnLine">length and pressed the catch. The lighter burst into flames.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jims found himself staring into the malevolent features of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kruger, and almost touching the hand which held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigarette lighter, was a leveled Colt forty-five!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For one fleeting moment Jims and Kruger eyed each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. Then Kruger with a weak smile slipped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun into his pocket. Jims snapped on the light switch near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. He faced Kruger ready to demand a full explana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Kruger saw this coming and was wise enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the initiative.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sorry to scare you like I did, Jims. You see I was after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a suspicious character I saw looking in at the office windows</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few minutes ago. He was a seedy-looking individual,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite possibly a tramp. It just happened that I saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my suspicions were aroused. He moved around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office building, trying each window. I hurried to my quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters for my gun. When I came back the tramp was ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching the pilots' quarters, walking in the shadows. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw him slip into the hallway, that was but a moment ago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he got inside the building I lost sight of him. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a faint noise in your room and came to investigate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had hardly got in here when you came. Naturally I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought you were the tramp, and so I waited. Sorry if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave you a scare," Kruger laughed easily, as though dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">missing the matter as of small importance. But Jims knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eyes of the superintendent were watching him closely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to catch the first faint sign of suspicion. Jims kept his feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings hidden and answered Kruger with a dry chuckle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"T'H admit I was rather worried for a moment, finding</seg><seg type="columnLine">-*• some one inside my room in the dark. Who wouldn't be?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here, I bought some good cigars up town; have one?" Jims</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed Kruger a cigar with docile innocence. Kruger took</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with thanks and Jims almost laughed outright at the smug</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile on Kruger's face. The man believed his explanation</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone over. He even arose and took himself away with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out further mention of the tramp. Jims took quick stock</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his room, but could see nothing disturbed. He went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed wondering why Kruger had been there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning he knew. Jims had a peculiar way</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his own in folding his clothes, in placing his letters and</seg><seg type="columnLine">personal papers in his bag. Those papers and his clothes</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been disturbed. It had been a master hand which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">searched his effects. Everything was placed just as Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">had left it. Only one man out of a dozen would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed a single detail lacking. But Jims did. He sat down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his bed thoughtfully and tried to arrive at some reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">why Kruger should go through his belongings. Had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's suspicions been aroused in some quarter? Did he be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve that Jims had come to the company seeking work as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Above the Rainbow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">11</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">an under cover man sent on detail from the sheriffs office?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At breakfast, O'Neal, a short, heavy-set pilot, told Jims he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to take out his H. V. ship and follow him to Rainbow</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bridge. O'Neal had a full party of Eastern tourists going up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jims routed out his ground crew and trundled his ship out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the line. The motor was warmed up while he went over</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls. Jims had never flown an H. V., but after exam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ination he discovered it was on the same principle as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">war-time De Havilands. The other flyers had described</seg><seg type="columnLine">much of the country to Jims and he was eager to view it</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took off close on O'Neal's tail and the two planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">circled east over the village, passing between the peaks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sunset Mountain. The Frisco Peaks glistened with snow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the scenic beauty of the tall stately pines thrilled Jims.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They crossed over Dead Man's Flat. Jims recognized it</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the sage and the low stunted growth of trees. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">that came black and red malapi country, then grass lands</seg><seg type="columnLine">with grazing herds. Far to the left the huge bulk of-Gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mountain and White Horse Mesa showed. A meager rib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bon of silver, a bridge and an Indian Trading post shot by.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was the Little Colorado River. All these things were</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful, but Jims now crossed a country quite beyond im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agination. The Painted Desert! The colored sands, distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirages, now and then Indian children herding mixed bands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sheep and goats. And over all this a feeling of immeasur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able spaces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T'HE planes now verged a little to the east, passed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">canyons, mesas, more waste-lands, red, rocky country and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flats, with Navajo Mountain showing purple in the distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another ship appeared out of the north. When it met</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jims' H. V. the pilot dipped a wing. It was Murphy bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Flagstaff with his passengers. Jims flew in close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Neal's ship and the two planes crossed around Navajo</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mountain to the north and east. A wild country through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which man and beast passed with great diffculty appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">below. And in a canyon, red standstone showing on all</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides, O'Neal dipped his wings and circled. Jims looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and was for a moment speechless with wonder. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">great rainbow, carved by nature from stone, reached out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one red wall across a small stream. Its splendor, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">glorious beauty were beyond description.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jims followed O'Neal as his ship turned east and crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a long, red, flat-topped mesa. A landing field and build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings appeared below. O'Neal circled and went down. Jims</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tourists were turned over to guides and Jims was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown around the landing field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a small machine shop for repairing the planes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a store and a two-story hotel at Rainbow Field. On all</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides Jims was surprised at the expense Richards had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">to, in order to build up his tourist business. O'Neal assured</seg><seg type="columnLine">him it was a paying proposition; rumor had it that Richards</seg><seg type="columnLine">had turned down a cold million for his property.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">After lunch O'Neal took off for the return trip. Jims'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">H.	V. developed motor trouble. He and a mechanic worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the motor until nightfall before it would take off. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">superintendent at the Lodge tried to get Jims to wait until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the following morning, but as the night was bright, Jims</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided he would be able to locate landmarks easily. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides he wanted to see Murphy as soon as possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had covered about half the distance to Coke Field when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he distinctly heard another plane coming toward him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the north. Jims banked and reconnoitered. Sure enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">there it was, a ship with high altitude, coming fast. Red</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed from the exhausts. There was no ship left at Rain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow Field. Jims zoomed for altitude, and the next moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was surprised to see the other ship zoom also. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">close now. Jims cut his motor and leveled out. The other</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship came on, passed over the H. V. Jims nosed upward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A dark, helmeted head showed over the cowling. Jims</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved. The pilot did not return the greeting. Jims zoomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the H. V. to higher level. The other ship turned west and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried away. In a few moments it was rapidly disappearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jims turned to his original course thoughtfully. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange plane was fast, much faster than the H. V. he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">piloting. And Jims had seen distinctly in the bright moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, a canvas covercd object bracketed to the cowling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That barreled object was undoubtedly a machine-gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At eleven o'clock Jims reached Coke Field. Not knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">just where Murphy's room was, he decided to wait until</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning. To ask about Murphy might arouse suspicion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was awakened in the cold dawn by the roar of a ship on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the field. He went to the window and stuck his head out. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship was warming up on the dead-line. Tourists in heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">coats were being seated aboard the plane. A man in leather</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying togs looked towards the barracks building, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner room which was visible through the alley running be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the hangars. It was Murphy. Jims waved his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Murphy replied likewise. Jims watched until Murphy</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed into the cockpit and the chocks were pulled. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane went roaring down the field Up went the tail and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big passenger ship sailed away over the pines and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city, to disappear in the morning mists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jims had just settled himself in bed again when there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a knock on his door. At his answer a mechanic in</seg><seg type="columnLine">greasy overalls came in. He gave Jims a folded piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper. When he had gone Jims unfolded the note. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief and from Murphy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Watch out for Kruger. He is wise to all three of vs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now what did Murphy mean by that? It was a warning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some kind which Murphy expected Jims to see. "He is</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise to all three of us." That might mean Kruger was aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Jims was working with Whitlock and Murphy. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">confound it, Jims had an odd feeling that Murphy had writ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten another meaning in his words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jims was still attempting to solve Murphy's queer mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage that morning while he worked on his plane. A me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanic came out to the hangar where he was and told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a telephone call for him in the office. Only Kru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger was in the office. He gave Jims a smiling good morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, a smile that Jims was always interpreting as meaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">something else. He picked up the telephone receiver and</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is the hospital," came a feminine voice briskly over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wire. "Is this Mr. Jims speaking? You are wanted here</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately. Can you come at once?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," replied Jims hurriedly. As he went through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door he looked back, Kruger was looking at him. Unsmil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, but in his eyes was a hidden meaning which he veiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly as Jims faced him. At that moment an odd thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the new pilot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kruger," he said, "I don't know why, but I've a queer</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea you and I have met before ? Do you know what friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mine could be in the hospital?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'"THIS time Kruger did not smile his oily grin. He merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook his head as he said: "I can't recall ever seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">your face before. And, I've an idea your friend Whitlock</seg><seg type="columnLine">is in the hospital."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jims walked over to Kruger's desk. "How do you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whidock is a friend of mine?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who wouldn't know, living in this town? I know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Murphy, and Whitlock were aviators together in France</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made rather a reputation for yourselves. You and Whit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock were decorated twice. Murphy holds five different med-</seg><seg type="columnLine">als and has the palm to his Croix de Guerre. Murphy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitlock have many friends here. Every small boy in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">place knows just what I have told you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see," said Jims slowly. "I'm going to tell you some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, Kruger. When I first saw you, I took an instant dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to you. You know how hate is sometimes instinctive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A lot of suspicious things have happened since. But right</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, I don't exactly dislike you. Pity, maybe you'd call it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Jims did feel just that "You'd be a hard man to cross.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm going to tell you something else. Both Murphy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whidock saved my life in France. Murphy several times.</seg><seg type="columnLine">12</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Flying Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Those two are my buddies. I'd go through hell for them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitlock is in the hospital, probably through dirty work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If anything should happen to Murphy or Whitlock, I'd kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man who was responsible, just as quick as I would kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mad dog. I don't know just what kind of a game Murphy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Whitlock have a hand in. I do know that the man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">downs them is going to get his, mighty damned quick! If</seg><seg type="columnLine">your hands are clean, you needn't worry about what I'm say-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. But if you have a hand in anything concerning them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd better take a one, two look see!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kruger looked into Jims' eyes without flinching. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly his face fell. Unmasked, he looked years older. More</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a tired old man who has seen too much of life. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a slight cough, he turned to his desk and began sort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing letters and bills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jims walked two blocks, caught a cruising taxi and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisked to the hospital. The nurse in the office was wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for him and without a word led him to a private room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitlock sat up in bed propped there by pillows. One arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in a sling and bandages showed through pajamas on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left side and shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">""LTELLO, Jims," said Whitlock, as his former army pal</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a chair close to the bed. "They got me right</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time. Won't be able to stir for some time. Got me while</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was closing the doors of my garage last night Broke my</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm, and put two more bullets in my shoulder and side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor says he doesn't quite see why I am alive today."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Know who it was?" Jims asked quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whitlock nodded. "I wasted all morning deciding whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">I should call you or not It was one man with a high-pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered rifle standing across the street. I did not see him well</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to be sure, but just the same I know now. Murphy</seg><seg type="columnLine">has had a wild theory all along which I didn't believe. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know he is right. Here Jims, take a look at this, it's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clue."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whitlock brought out a narrow piece of paper from under</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pillow. Jims unfolded it and stared perplexed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper was about as big as a postcard and had been slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into an envelope. There was no writing on it, only a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maltese cross, exactly the same size as the German Iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cross. The background around the cross was a brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">red. Jims looked up at Whitlock inquiringly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you recognize it? Think back to the war, Brock!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">A great light of understanding broke on Jims. During</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last days of the war their squadron had been at deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">grips with a squadron of Fokkers who had painted a bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liant scarlet background around the black crosses on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good night! What has the war got to do with all this?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitlock smiled grimly. "Murphy came to me with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild story that there was a German ace from that old enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">squadron here in Flagstaff, seeking revenge. If you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember closely, you'll recollect that you, Murphy and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">got more ships of their Red Squadron than any other men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, here we are, all together! At one time a story cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culated from the enemy that one of us, supposed to be Mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phy, had shot down a young lieutenant who was a brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Red Squadron's commander."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This thing is utterly preposterous!" broke out Jims.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why, it is absolutely crazy! Impossible--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The very words I used when Murphy first told it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me," said Whitlock. "But now I'm ready to believe 'most</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything. I received that piece of paper through the mail</seg><seg type="columnLine">yesterday morning. Murphy got one at the same time. I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be at all surprised if you got one of the black crosses</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the red background soon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why--I thought it was the bootleggers who were trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get you and Murphy? I can't figure this out, it's too</seg><seg type="columnLine">complicated."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You said it!" avered Whitlock. "And when it is figured</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, we'll find it so simple, we'll wonder how we could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">so dense. Yet figure it out we must."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jims was looking at Whitlock incredulously, but he knew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that Whitlock and Murphy would be the last men on earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be taken in by a wild, fanciful theory. "Who shot you?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who does Murphy think this German ace is?" Yet as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked he knew he could answer his own questions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The answer to both is the same,*' said Whitlock slowly;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Kruger."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Jims got back to the airport office, only the steno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grapher was there. On inquiry, he was informed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kruger had left nearly an hour before without saying where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was going. In the hangar the ground crews told him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kruger had taken out a ship and gone up alone. Murphy</seg><seg type="columnLine">was due back at eleven o'clock from Rainbow Field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With time to kill, Jims walked across the field to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">county sheriff's hangar. Whitlock had told him about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane; that it was equipped with a synchronized machine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun. Jims found the mechanic putting in time doing odd</seg><seg type="columnLine">jobs. The plane was in tip-top condition, oiled and fueled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the air after rum runners or others, at a moment's</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Murphy did not come in at eleven o'clock. Twelve and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one o'clock came without Murphy or Kruger. Jims went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office and called Rainbow Field on the phone. Murphy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had started back at nine. Kruger had just left. The trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">should consume about three hours, unless trouble developed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murphy should have been in long ago. Jims continued to</seg><seg type="columnLine">loaf nervously about the hangars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The afternoon mail brought Jims a thin envelope and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he opened it he was not at all surprised to find an exact re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plica of the Maltese cross Whitlock had shown him. Jims</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to the office, took Kruger's swivel chair and placed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet on top of the desk. The stenographer eyed him dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dainfully until he removed them some time later. At four</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock a ship landed on the field. When it taxied up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the line, Kruger descended from the cockpit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If he was surprised to see Jims sitting in his chair he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not evidence it as he pulled off his flying coat and helmet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's Murphy?" said Jims shortly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Isn't he here now?" said Kruger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. Pie should have been back about noon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He started back alone without any passengers," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kruger. "I didn't see him as I came south. Maybe he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced down somewhere. Any phone messages come in?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked the stenographer, and received a negative reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe we had better send out a couple of ships to</seg><seg type="columnLine">search," said Kruger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That wouldn't be a bad idea," returned J ims coldly, with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out removing himself from Kruger's chair. One hand was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his pocket, fingering a Colt automatic forty-five which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitlock had given him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kruger went to the door to call for O'Neal and McMul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">len. Only O'Neal appeared in answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is McMullen?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"TTE left early this morning, said you'd told him he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> -*-■*- could have the day off," replied O'Neal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kruger frowned. "I told him he could have the morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">off. Murphy is missing. Probably forced down somewhere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You take off, and tell--" Kruger broke off and looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jims. "Want to go?" he finished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jims nodded his head. O'Neal hurried to the hangars to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get his ship ready. Jims stood up and, with his left hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread out a slip of paper on the desk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take a look at that, Kruger," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kruger went to the desk and looked down. But so well</seg><seg type="columnLine">was he in control of himself, only the barest start of sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise showed. He picked it up, turned it over in his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and laid it tack down. When he faced Jims he was smiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Turned artist since the war, Jims ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kruger was so sure, so certain. Jims went cold all over.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There mounted in him a desire to kill. How he overcame</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impulse to jerk out his gun and shoot, he did not know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a bitter laugh he turned on his heel and slammed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office door behind him. O'Neal was ready to take off. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hailed Jims.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Above the Rainbow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">13</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You take the route east of Moencopi Wash that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed yesterday. There's two ways to go. I'll take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, west of the Wash and Tuba City."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> O'Neal climbed into the cockpit and his ship went roaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the air. Jims went to the hangar and ordered his plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">trundled out to the line. He went over it carefully while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mechanic and greasehound started the motor. Thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes after O'Neal left, Jims was in the air. He felt no</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerness to hurry. A cold dread was holding him back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kruger and the strange plane with the mounted machine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun filled his mind. That machine-gun was not there for</seg><seg type="columnLine">ornamentation. The man who flew that ship expected to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Jims could not, however, connect that ship and gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">plausibly with the Rainbow Transportation ships. It fitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in with a desperate rum-running gang. If the plane was</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Rainbow Transportation hangars, the machine-gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to be unmounted before it landed on the Rain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow Fields. This was not likely, unless there were a hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">field somewhere which the strange pilot used. This too, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not likely. It was more reasonable to think that the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane had a hangar hidden somewhere in the mountains or</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert It was easier to believe that the pilot came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Rainbow Fields than the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JIMS thundered the H. V. high over Sunset Mountain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sped swiftly over Dead Man's Flat and headed directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into tlfe north. Over there, north of the Painted Desert, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had felt bad air currents the day before. This was a likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot in which a ship would encounter difficulties. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Little Colorado River and Moencopi Wash had passed be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, he descended to lower levels. The Painted Desert was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gyrating mass of heat waves in the evening sun. No life</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirred on the sands. A lone black eagle circling low over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge was the only living thing in that desolate, beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Painted Desert ended. Jims banked and returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">search again in the vacant spaces. Circling, flying low, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came again to the edge of the desert where the canyons and</seg><seg type="columnLine">red, treeless mesas began. Over a red gash the H. V.</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck a bad air pocket and nosed down suddenly. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty, Jims stopped the plunge just before hitting a sky-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rearing crag, and zoomed upward. Here in this broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">country with the sky full of pockets, close search would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult. Circling low, he came to a salt-brush flat. In wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">spots the brush had died out and the salty, hard-crusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth glistened upward in the sun. In such a spot a landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be made. Neither would a take-off be difficult.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Steadily Jims drifted into the north, flying low, always</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching. He came to a wide valley. Grama-grass cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the floor like a velvet carpet. In this valley, natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">monuments reared upward in all manner of fantastic shapes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jims was far off his course now. He had heard the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">flyers talk of Monument Valley and so was able to recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nize it There, he changed his course west, toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north end of Navajo Mountain. It was sunset when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped down on the field at Rainbow Lodge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found the superintendent worried. No word had yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">been received of Murphy. O'Neal had been at the field,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reported no luck and, after a hasty meal, had taken off</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Telephone communication had been kept up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coke Field. The superintendent said Murphy had probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">been forced down somewhere. He'd walk to an Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">hogan, get a horse and ride into the nearest trading post</seg><seg type="columnLine">He told Jims of one other flyer who had been forced down</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Painted Desert. That pilot had walked two days and</seg><seg type="columnLine">two nights before finding a hogan and getting a horse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jims listened soberly while he ate. It was dark when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had finished, had his ship refueled and was in the air again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The moon came up. He followed his old course towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the south, always circling as low as he dared, hoping, if</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Murphy were able, he would build a signal fire. Surely he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would know that Jims would be worried and out searching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jims was hanging low over the canyon country again</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the roar of another ship came to him. He cut the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor, and then opened the gun wide, zooming. The other</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship was close and coming out of the south. He thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other might be O'Neal, yet another look showed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane was without running lights. O'Neal would have his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wing lights on. Warily Jims went for altitude. The other</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship did likewise, coming fast at the H. V.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment later, a strange singing went across the wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the H. V. Jims saw the stabbing flame from a machine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun as he nosed down with a power dive. He darted the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">H.	V. up under the other ship and hung there for a moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So this pilot was gunning for him I Jim felt the old war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time thrill which was quickly dispelled. Here he was badly</seg><seg type="columnLine">handicapped. Weaponless! The pilot of the other ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not an experienced dog-fighter. Had the situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">been reversed, Jims could have brought the unarmed ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">down quickly. That the pilot did have some fighting experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence however, was soon evident. He dropped with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Immelmann roll and shot back at the H. V. in a twinkling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jims' blood went cold. Bullets flayed the wings. The cowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing splintered just as Jims dove out of range. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earlier night's experience he knew the stranger had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster ship. Dark blotches of clouds were drifting across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bright moonlight sky. Jims maneuvered higher and</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward those clouds, drawing the other ship after him. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">only hope was to reach the clouds and slip in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other ship hung on tenaciously. Fighting the weapon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less ship, it was not necessary to "cover up." But he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a man who had outwitted, out-maneuvered and out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought the best German aces. Jims drew on all his knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of air fighting to save his life now. He soon dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered that the other pilot was afraid the two ships would</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash together when they were close, and he quickly took ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage of it. He was on the other's tail, over him, under</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, in rapid maneuvering. Jims made the other pilot be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve he was deliberately setting about to crash and take his</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy to death with him. The man was nervous in the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too nervous to make a good fighter. Jims also knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a single burst at the right moment from the other ship would</seg><seg type="columnLine">send him down. He took desperate chances in attempting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get close enough to see the other pilot. All he could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the helmeted head of the other above the cowling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the time the planes were reaching the ceiling. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy cloud now was close. A moment came when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving mass was between them and the moon. And in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows Jims swung into the cloud with all possible speed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bullets swept into the crate of the H. V. as it disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HEN he came through the feathery mists, he banked</seg><seg type="columnLine">north instead of south; cut his motor and listened The</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar of the other ship was flung back by the wind. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">banked south then and passed again into the cloud. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear air once more, he cut the motor, listened and searched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky for red exhaust. The other ship was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dropped low over the earth, hoping that if Murphy</seg><seg type="columnLine">were down in that wild, unbroken country, he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">set a signal fire. To that one hope he clung. The canyon</seg><seg type="columnLine">country was now nothing but black precipices and deep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowed labyrinths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jims came to the salt-brush flat and recognized it because</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moonlight glistened and gleamed on the open salt lands</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it did during the day. He passed over it in circles and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the painted desert began, banked and returned. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">salt-brush flat drew him like a lodestone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He caught his breath suddenly. Ahead, just at the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pinon trees where the canyon country began, a red</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue of flame leaped into the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the June issue of Flying Stories, this baffling mystery continues with added</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrills and suspense until, with a stirring climax, the tangled threads of intrigue are un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">raveled.

Tex !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We'd all been sitting there, and I for one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Sis, Tex and Shep for the other three,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been looking into the east, toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing field of Parris Island, above which</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the battiest fliers I had ever seen was doing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Loops, spins, nose dives, falling leafs, Immelmanns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wing-overs, and--well, I don't begin to know 'em all, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe there weren't any names for most of the things</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bugs" Snelling was doing. I knew, as did the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">three, that the flyer over that field was Bugs Snelling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No one else ever did the stunts he did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That," said Shep Duncan, "is what I call flying. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sort of thing I want to do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait," I cautioned, "for that bird to land. Ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him? He always lands the same way, ending his</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying day by giving the neighbors a treat. See! There</seg><seg type="columnLine">he comes!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bugs was flying a monoplane, a light pursuit, tiiat was</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster than 1 am when I'm scared. Every afternoon I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him land, and he had a habit of coming into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field lightning-fast, diving under the telephone line which</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralleled one side of the field. I'd watched him every</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     14</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">evening, as aforesaid, and whether I was hoping he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">break his neck is nobody's business. Anyway, I'd always</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him--and wondered how long he would last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, he banked away around and came in as usual,</seg><seg type="columnLine">(lying like a bat out of Dante's masterpiece, diving down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to swoop under those wires and over the concrete road</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the huge field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gosh, those wires looked low! Not much clearance, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a barbed wire fence still lower down. Close flying. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bugs Snelling had made it a hundred times or more to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But somehow, this time, maybe because both Shep Dun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can and Tex McCullough were going to take up this</seg><seg type="columnLine">sport, I watched with new interest, and all of us fell silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Snelling came in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Closer and closer he came to the telephone line, lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lower dropped his trucks. Nothing much, after all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He'd make it this time, as he'd made it a hundred times</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. We all got the idea at the same time and relaxed</seg><seg type="columnLine">our tension, sitting back again in our chairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a gust of wind did something to Bugs. Just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would have zipped under the wires as usual, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot up into the air as though he had hit a dip in a tobag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan slide. His trucks, traveling at a hundred and forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles an hour, hooked onto the wires and Bug's turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">over on his nose in the batting of an eyelash. He dived</seg><seg type="columnLine">right into that concrete road on the other side of the line!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, I maintain that when an airplane dives into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">concrete road at that many miles per hour, and from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">height of thirty feet or so, it hits like the devil and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">some. At least Bugs did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, believe it or not, Bugs' ship was a wreck. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">biggest piece left of it could have been used handily for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a toothpick. And as for Bugs. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, Bugs had made his last dive under telephone</seg><seg type="columnLine">wires, unless they have telephones and airplanes in heaven--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was gathered in on the Marine Corps' Parris Island</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply of blotters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shep looked at Tex. I looked at Shep and Tex. Shep</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Tex looked at me. This was their out. They'd put</seg><seg type="columnLine">in for aviation, and their papers probably hadn't left their</seg><seg type="columnLine">respective offices yet. All they had to do to renege was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get their papers and heave 'em into the waste-basket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the safety-first precaution of tearing them to bits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But next day those two saps left for wherever they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were going, to get their wings. Four months later I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered to Santo Domingo, and took Sis with me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had a nice house in Gascue, with nigger servants</seg><seg type="columnLine">and such, plenty of good drinks--all soft drinks of course!--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had grow'n to like it. Breakfast at nine o'clock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out of the west there suddenly came the blasting</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar of a low-flying ship. I dashed out. I knew already</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was what, though, for Shep had preceded me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Santo Domingo, and I'd heard enough about his stunting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to know it probably was he. Besides, this low flying over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city was against orders, which was why Shep, being</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sort of a buzzard, was doing just that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sis and I ran out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shep was certainly putting on a show. A burro, hazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">along by a native woman, and piled high with market</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff, was trudging down the road toward us. She looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">back as the motor blasted in her ears, then started to run.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But too late, as the titles say. The burro only wagged</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ears, unconcerned like, not knowing what was coming.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not all the burros in Santo Domingo had as yet been</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained by Shep Duncan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHEP tilted his De Haviland up in the air and gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">her the gun right over the old woman and her burro.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The old woman's clothes flew up over her head, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">squatted in the road as though an armored tank had run</seg><seg type="columnLine">over her, covered by her clothes like a tent. The burro</seg><seg type="columnLine">took to his heels and jobos, mclones, mainey apples, pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">latas, chicharrones, every marketable thing the burro</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore, was scattered from here to there as though a hurri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cane had done it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Shep wasn't worried. By the time the woman had</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided that the Judgment Day hadn't arrived after all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shep had touched his wheels to the flat roof of our house</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had ducked on over the city, his wheels spinning mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. His ship was careening from side to side. He--well--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he flew like a crazy man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We got to the roof by a ladder and watched Shep go</seg><seg type="columnLine">winging his way thence. We stood upright on the roof,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">15</seg><seg type="columnLine">16</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Flying Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dust of which we had caught a glimpse of the trace</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his wheels, and watched him go. Over the Ozama he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had banked left, flying close to die water, as we knew be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause we couldn't see him, for a moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he came into sight, climbing straight up. grabbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">for altitude with his prop--and we knew, and gasped as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knowledge came home to us, that he'd flown under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge which spanned the river, where he had somediing</seg><seg type="columnLine">like three feet of clearance for his wings!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just before we went down from the roof, we saw an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other ship which was so far away, almost straight over</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, that we could scarcely hear the engine. That flyer</seg><seg type="columnLine">had so much altitude that he could have been married</seg><seg type="columnLine">and divorced before his ship could have struck the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a tight spin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That, Sis," I said, "is Tex McCullough, safe and sane</seg><seg type="columnLine">flyer. Always believes in having gliding radius, down</seg><seg type="columnLine">here where fields are few and far between."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sis was a bit thoughtful as we climbed down the lad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der and went into the house. Then Sis delivered her</seg><seg type="columnLine">bombshell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"T OOK, Bud,'' she told me. "I love both of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">boobs, so help me; but I'm not sure I like a 'fraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">cat as a husband. Same time, early widowhood doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeal to me. I want you to take rides with each of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows, and let me know what you think about it"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, Sis," I said, suddenly having visions of ships fall-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ten miles in flames, or crashing into the steel trusses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bridges, "I thought you told me once you preferred to</seg><seg type="columnLine">manage your own affairs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do," says the kid sister. "I'm doing it You're one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my means to an end!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The way she said "end" somehow stuck in my craw.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, well, did you ever have a persistent kid sister?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next day I hopped to Macoris with Shep Duncan on</seg><seg type="columnLine">trumped up official business, while Sis waited at the field</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me to come back, which I had doubts about doing. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass over that ride speedily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We took the hats off seven natives riding burros; spun</seg><seg type="columnLine">our trucks on four subanas, each the size of a handker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief, with trees a hundred feet high walling them all</seg><seg type="columnLine">around; flew along the road with altitude of something</seg><seg type="columnLine">under three feet; blew smoke back down the huge chim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neys of three sugar refineries; dropped into the Macoris</seg><seg type="columnLine">field over telephone wires, so close to 'em that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">hummed like jews-harps after we had passed--'sfact, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard 'em above the roaring of the motor!--did our</seg><seg type="columnLine">business; took off for the return, under those wires, climb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing straight up right alongside the poles; replaced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hats on the heads of six out of seven of the natives on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way back--the seventh saw us coming and ducked!--</seg><seg type="columnLine">sucked the smoke back up the chimneys of the three sugar</seg><seg type="columnLine">refineries, flew along the road upside down, touched those</seg><seg type="columnLine">four fields still upside down, while Shep kicked up dirt by</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitting the ground with his helmet as we passed over, and--</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, isn't that long enough for one sentence?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I stepped out of the De Haviland--think of it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a De Haviland!--at the home field, ,1 had lost exactly fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds, was perspiring like a black man in a Dominican</seg><seg type="columnLine">election campaign and my knees were knocking together</seg><seg type="columnLine">so badly that the mechanic kept the motor of the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">revved up to kill the sound and save me embarrassment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sis," I choked. "Sis!

A kid sister, you know!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In wide spirals Tex lifted that old De Haviland.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Honest, I never realized that riding in an airplane could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be so comfortable, like riding on granddaddy's rocking-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair at home. The field below kept getting smaller and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller, further and further away, but Tex, watching his</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments, looking over first one side and then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, kept climbing, until I thought we'd starve to death</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he pointed her nose at Azua. When he did do so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the altimeter said twelve thousand, which was eleven</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand, eight hundred feet higher than I'd ever been</seg><seg type="columnLine">before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I loved it. We sailed along like love's young dream.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Piles of clouds were everywhere, as soon as we got into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cordilleras.

When we got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane back next day--I had landed just eighteen miles from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flying field--it showed not the slightest damage. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had to make another try for my "A" license.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My disappointment in that was more than made up by</seg><seg type="columnLine">iiit* confidence I had gained in myself, in my machine, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the knowledge that the instruction I had received would</seg><seg type="columnLine">equip me for any emergency.

I maintained that</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of going back</seg><seg type="columnLine">you should go straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, heedless of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">risk of a spin.

Beginners are taught to make automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and subconscious movements for every possible condition</seg><seg type="columnLine">encountered in the air. I recall an amusing experience with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lady Bailey with all the thrills one could desire. It serves</seg><seg type="columnLine">to illustrate this point</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was giving flying lessons to Lady Bailey, the brave little</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot, you remember, who recently made die long and ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duous circuit of aerial Africa. Her husband disapproved</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her flying. So each morning I used to- call for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed in white and carrying a tennis racket. The family</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought we were practising to beat Helen Wills and Mile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lenglen, instead of Colonel Lindbergh and his comrades</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the air. Lady Bailey decided not to tell them about her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">higher aims until she</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew how to pilot a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. It saved so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">debating!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After I had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">her about five hours of</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruction, I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">she should learn how</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get out of a tail</seg><seg type="columnLine">spin. I took her up to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">3,000	feet and then ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained to her what it</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant to get into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spin and how easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could come out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Through the speak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-tube I instructed:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Throttle right back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then when the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine is going as slowr</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly as possible, pull the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick hard back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">give full left rudder."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She nodded and pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded to follow or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was time to pick out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best place for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced landing. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">only field within reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">was down wind, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was well sprinkled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with cattle and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">obstacles.

I was dumfounded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">discover that the machine had been newly fitted with a self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">starter! I could easily have used it in mid-air. Even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cows blushed at my remarks when I saw that wretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">starter glinting at me in the sunlight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Forced landings are rarely hazardous to the careful pilot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You are taught, urged, reminded and ordered, from the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning, to keep a landing ground within gliding distance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if you have to go somewhat out of your course to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">near one. This is no more unreasonable than for a distance-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swimmer to keep within easy distance of a buoy or boat. Or</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a motorist to keep a weather eye on gas stations, tire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">repair shops, garages and hot-dog stands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the start of my flying life I found that men were dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">couraging women from learning how to fly. There are some</seg><seg type="columnLine">today--happily only a few--who think women cannot make</seg><seg type="columnLine">good, safe pilots. Remember the uproar only a few years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago about women driving automobiles and motorcycles?</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Those days are gone forever," and that applies to aviation</seg><seg type="columnLine">too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps this attitude of conservative man is due to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">inherited habit of protecting the sex which once was con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered the weaker. But the final test of safety is in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">insurance which the pilot can obtain. And there are a num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of women pilots who rank quite as high as the best men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in freedom from accidents--which means insurability.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when I started for my commercial license, insurance</seg><seg type="columnLine">for women pilots was quite unheard of. I shall never forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">my difficulty in getting insured for the first time, or what</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed. The tragi-comic experience served to further re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duce my bump of overestimation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as I had finally decided to become an aerial taxi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">driver, three weeks after receiving my "A" license, I resigned</seg><seg type="columnLine">as secretary of the Ladies' Atheneum, a society club in Lon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don. Then I enrolled at the De Haviland Air School for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">three months' course. To qualify as a passenger-carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot I had to learn all about navigation, the motor and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine, so that I could make long and wearying trips over</seg><seg type="columnLine">land and water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T HAD to study meteorology, to know whether my ship was</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely to run into a storm and cause discomfort to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers. There were the flying rules of various countries</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn (I had already passed an oral examination in lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">and signals and traffic regulations). It doesn't take long</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cross a European state in a 100-mile-ari-hour ship, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">each nation has its own traffic rules of the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I had to know all about fixing my own engine, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">means a great deal more than cleaning spark-plugs and using</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hairpin for a connector. I alsd had to get into the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible physical condition, for on this depends the lives of</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers and safety of the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I received ground lectures and flying instruction in every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing a pilot should know, from astronomy and instruments</seg><seg type="columnLine">to engines and rigging.

Most male pilots pass at about</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty-five. My years of athletics of course had helped me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintain the high standards required. In one test I had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand on one foot for a long time, and also hold my breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">as long as I could--no doubt in anticipation of a transatlantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunge!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The physical tests were really not difficult, being designed</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely to insure that those flying above cities and towns</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">should not throw a fit or collapse from heart failure, and thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">endanger those below as well as in the plane. In May, 1926,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the International Air Navigation Commission in effect lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ban on women pilots, arranging to qualify all who passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the medical tests to pilot passengers for hire, to fly taxiplanes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and commercial air expresses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was now ready to apply for insurance, so essential for</seg><seg type="columnLine">moral effect and for actual protection of passengers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">property. But the companies were very loath to insure a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman. My many hours in the air without accident did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">impress them a bit, apparently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But at last, after much persuasion, they granted me a three</seg><seg type="columnLine">months' policy! Even then they were taking no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances than necessary, for the rate was made very high.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, to encourage me in playing safe, they promised to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rebate one-half the premium if I had no crash within the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">months.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile I had joined an aviation company, and had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting job doing stunts at various provincial centers. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looped the loop, did various spins, rolled, banked and nose-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dived, also made parachute drops. I had a glorious time for</seg><seg type="columnLine">three months, and did a tremendous amount of flying the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">before my probation period was up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I was still safe and sound, my plane was undamaged, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt very much pleased with myself. What could possibly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">happen now--to me? So I wired the hard-hearted insurance</seg><seg type="columnLine">people: "Now wdiat about it? Hurry up with that refund."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next day, the last day of grace, which I must safely pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I would get one-half of my heavy premium back, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to take my little machine out of a grassy meadow.

And it was all an accident.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You see I got into die news reel business and considerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble, after having been sacked as a director for die</seg><seg type="columnLine">Glimmer Films Corporation. It seems that I lost my temper</seg><seg type="columnLine">and did serious things to a third cousin of J. Jason Jessup,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the producer. This cousin, an oaf who had been inflicted</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the world with the title of Hymie Garfinkle, thought he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an actor, whereas I couldn't give him credit even for</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking. Such a situation was bound to result in trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">sooner or later and die sooner the better for me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Jessup unloaded the cluck on me he gave me in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structions to do something with him. At first sight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">offensive beak and the shiny, black, petroleum-plastered</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair, I knew diat if I did what I wanted to do with him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd never get anywhere in life. They hang men for that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even in California.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first, I used him as background in scenes where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had only to stand around and look stupid. He was a success</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that becausc he stayed in character. This perfect arrange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment didn't last long before die blow-up came. The lad</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to me one day and said he had been crying on his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cousin's shoulder, and that Mr. Jessup didn't think his</seg><seg type="columnLine">family was being done right by. After that time, he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was going to take leading roles in plays which I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to direct. Furdiermore, he said that the pictures</seg><seg type="columnLine">were going to be diose he would write himself. Besides</seg><seg type="columnLine">diat, he informed me I'd better not argue because he'd get</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cousin to fire me on account of I wasn't much good</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Holding my temper and wishing to know how near Hymie</seg><seg type="columnLine">had approximated the process of thinking, I invited him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain what type of pictures he was going to make.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TPHE idea diat was rattling around in the vacant spaces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lad's sconce was worthy of the peanut brain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had evolved it. In brief, Hymie was going to impersonate</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals. He had gone into a huddle with himself and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided that the world was waiting for a man who could por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tray the emotions and inner thoughts of dogs, tigers, elk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">polecats and other dumb beasts. If all the ideas that boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had nursed were placed end to end dicy would have reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep into the pit of inanity, but this one took the prize.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My uncle is behind me in this," he asserted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He couldn't be," I said. "You're at die end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">parade now. Perhaps you could make a fairly decent double</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Old Joe, our trained ape."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's just it," he came back enthusiastically. "I'll take</seg><seg type="columnLine">the part of an ape and make a human being out of him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">25</seg><seg type="columnLine">26</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Flying Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What's the use in trying to insult a baby like that?

The best you could do is try</seg><seg type="columnLine">and imitate a man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine," he said. "I will imitate a monkey trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">imitate a man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I socked him. I'm telling you I socked him seri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously and scientifically. If I had known then what part</seg><seg type="columnLine">that oaf and his addle-pated ideas were going to play in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my life, it would have been murder instead of mayhem I</seg><seg type="columnLine">committed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anyway, Jessup gave me the gate. The old man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">decent, but he was deluded into the idea that he owed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cousin some sort of a debt on account of family affairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometime in the past. I couldn't land as director anywhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">else, what with the industry going screwy over the talkies</seg><seg type="columnLine">and me being knowm as being too ready to make anatomi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal alterations in higher officials who made me angry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> AS a result I got into the news reel business. I hocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the automobile and the cocktail shaker, drew the reserve</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the bank and bought a plane. Then I hired Joboneau</seg><seg type="columnLine">Webster, one of California's best pilots and nature's mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terpiece in the way of white men. He wasn't so big nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">good-looking, but he was real people. When I was broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">and couldn't pay his wages he stuck through friendship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Together we filmed cataclysms, disasters, parades and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">tilings inflicted upon the fair state of California.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We got the first shot of the wreck of the Parrot off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast of Mexico and did some good work on the Santa Fe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Springs oil-well fire. The Webster boy was a valuable asset</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my business. I was free-lancing, selling my stuff to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular news reel companies. To do that, I had to get my</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff in ahead of the others or get exclusive shots. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Webster came in. He'd take more chances than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other pilots. He darned near singed the wings off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane on the oil-fire shot and he bucked a god-awful gale</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get the shipwreck film.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a tough battle and I always had a sneaking desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go back into the directing business, but there was cash</seg><seg type="columnLine">on hand most of the time. Jessup met me on the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">once and offered to take me back, if I'd direct that family</seg><seg type="columnLine">affliction of his in a picture. I turned it down. What the</seg><seg type="columnLine">movies lost, the news reel business gained. Life is that way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, when tilings are rolling along fairly smoothly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fate usually punctures a tire by way of letting a fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">know' life isn't all banana sherbet. That's what the lady did</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my news reel business. Just when business started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get good and Nature had allowed us a couple of forest fires</seg><seg type="columnLine">with another shipwreck thrown in as a bonus, Webster,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my pilot, goes and gets afflicted with love.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I noticed the symptoms in Webster while we were flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a football game at the Pasadena Bowl. The plane was</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding smoothly and I was cranking away at my camera.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The boys below got all tangled up with themselves and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the whole business in focus. Then the ship went crazy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It first went into a tail spin and then nosed upward again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After that, it flopped over on its back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I wondered if they'd spell my name right in the death</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice, and tried to figure things out At first, I thought a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wing had been washed out but I soon knew that that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the case on account of we were still up in the air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There seemed to be no immediate danger of falling, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't enjoying myself to any great degree. I never did</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust a life-belt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally, I put my hand on the stick in front of me. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved freely. Deciding that Webster had fainted or some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, I realized that it was up to me to do something. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">not so good as a pilot, having had only a hasty course at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kelly Field before the War ended. We had dual control</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the plane, so that I could spell Webster on long trips</seg><seg type="columnLine">in good weather; but the weather wasn't so good now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A higher power took the stick and some lesser divinities</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed the rudder bar, because the plane got right side up</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. I may have done it, but I don't remember how.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned to see what manner of death had taken Webster</seg><seg type="columnLine">from our midst. He was apparently conscious. He sat in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cockpit like a sack of meal but his eyes were open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if they didn't look intelligent. I throttled the motor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the idea?" I howled. "Trying to give the boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thrill? This crate wasn't made for stunting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sort of aroused himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Were we upside down?" he shouted back. "I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I flew the ship back and wondered whether they'd take</seg><seg type="columnLine">my pilot to the Stockton or the Norwalk home for persons</seg><seg type="columnLine">who have lost their marbles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the ground I asked him what was the big idea, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time watching for him to get violent and bite me in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leg. He had forgotten all about the little episode in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Know what she's gone and done?" he asked with a silly</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Know what who's done?" I demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's gone and started chasing around with that Hymie</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garfinkle," he answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, whoever she is she's screwy too," I said. "Any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one wlio'd look twice at Hymie isn't worth doing tail spins</seg><seg type="columnLine">for. Snap out of it. What's eating you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Helene," he said, real mournful. "Helene's gone and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditched me for that Hymie, on account of Hymie being</seg><seg type="columnLine">artistic and having an expressive soul and I'm just a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud-hopper and I don't know anything about a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">things I never even heard of."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where does Helene sell fish and why don't you hit her</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the head with a hard object? That sometimes cures</seg><seg type="columnLine">insanity," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She doesn't sell fish," Webster asserted. "She writes</seg><seg type="columnLine">plays and poems and tilings. She's going to write a play for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hymie. She thinks that nut idea of his about being an</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal is good. You couldn't hit her on the head with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard object You'd want to kiss her. She's as pretty as--</seg><seg type="columnLine">as--aw, hell, fella, she's as pretty as that new monoplane</seg><seg type="columnLine">job they got over at Long Beach."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just how did you come to have a head-on collision with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I took her for an airplane ride a couple of times. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to catch the voice of the upper regions. I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear a thing. Then I hung around her place and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">went places. Sometimes she liked me. Once she kissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and said maybe she'd marry me. Then she'd get sore</seg><seg type="columnLine">about me not having any definite ideas of the relation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pink lilies to a sunset over a purple mountain at half-past</seg><seg type="columnLine">six on a Friday in February."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">" TLJSTICE isn't blind," I groaned. "They got her mixed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Cupid. Lord, he doesn't care who the hell he shoots</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor what different brands of half-wits he drags together."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This remark was lost on Webster. The lad was punch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">goofy. Cupid had him on the ropes and the first round</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in its infancy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following days and events showed me that my news</seg><seg type="columnLine">reel business was in for hard times. I couldn't depend</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Webster at all. Some days he'd be cheerful because</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene had smiled at him and then he would fly through</seg><seg type="columnLine">hell. Then things would go wrong and I couldn't even</seg><seg type="columnLine">find him. We missed a good train wreck that way. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't get another pilot. In the first place, it wouldn't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair to Webster and in the second place no good pilot would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the job. The pay wasn't sure enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt sorry for Webster, too. He was a darned good</seg><seg type="columnLine">kid and it didn't seem right that some crack-brained fluff</seg><seg type="columnLine">should give him the run-around because he neither knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor cared anything about Hymie's brand of bilge.

Then I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind of something that was brewing on my old lot that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would make a darned good news-reel shot. The idiotic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hymie had promoted a publicity stunt that might click, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of the fact that he had thought of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE plan had to do with the credulity of the newspapers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, that far, was safe. They were going to announce</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a trained ape, (Old Joe, of whom I have spoken) had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone haywire, and that they were going to deport him to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">private zoo on Alazar Island, about twenty miles off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast. The trip was to be made in an airplane and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were going to take Helene Mayfare, the little lady who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had placed my pilot in a state of comma, along with them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The first story released to the newspapers would say that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had to take Helene because the ape loved her and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not behave for any one else. They did not state why it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was necessary to take an airplane, but neither the public</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor the newspapers thought to ask about that. Publicity</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">siderable, and I knew that the proposed trip to the island</seg><seg type="columnLine">would hurt him plenty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, when the day for the flight came, I managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drag him out to the strip of beach where the take-off</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be made. I figured I'd have to take a chance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Webster being able to do the job because other pilots</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted too much money, cash down, and I'm a business</seg><seg type="columnLine">man when I have to be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene was there. My first glimpse of her explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">why Webster acted that way. You may take my word for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, she was one neat little package. Two seconds after she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had smiled at me and confessed that she was glad to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">me meet her, I would have mortgaged my brilliant future</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the privilege of paying her bills the rest of my life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I judged that the kid was real people, down deep in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart, and that her artistic ideas were akin to a dose of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smallpox. Either she would get over it and be normal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or she'd get worse and be a nut the rest of her days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her eyes rested on Webster and she favored the lad with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a smile that made the one I got seem like a frown. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised to see that she actually liked my pilot. Her blue</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Joe? gotj into actions just then/.

Most unexpected happen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings occur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the preliminary publicity, the trip was to be made.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the ape wouldn't go. Instead, Hymie Garfinkle was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to don the habiliments of his not far removed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancestors and take the place of Old Joe. Then, later, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be released a story that Hymie had taken the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ape to prove his ability as an actor--that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">imitated an ape so cleverly that he had fooled the boys.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene would get her slice of publicity, also. It would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">announced that she was going to write a play, in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hymie was going to be starred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I decided that, despite my dislike for Hymie, business</seg><seg type="columnLine">was business. I figured I could either sell some footage on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing to news-reel companies, or that I could blackjack</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jessup out of a few nickels with it. I needed the money,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I planned to cover the thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Webster heard about the scheme, a look came into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes which promised poison, hanging, guns and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms of suicide. He figured that if she took that trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Hymie it would be all off for him. I did my best to</seg><seg type="columnLine">chcer him up but it didn't do much good. The lad was</seg><seg type="columnLine">seriously silly about the Helene person.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few days of grief passed. We didn't have anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do in the way of filming catastrophies and Webster</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't have been of much use anyway. He worried con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes danced with a warm glow, but her cherry lips were</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrinkled in a pout. She surely did think a lot of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Webster promptly blushed like an Italian sunset and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">swallowed his tongue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I'm so glad to see you," she trilled. "Don't you think</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this is a wonderful day? Isn't the water gorgeous? Isn't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the sky nice? Isn't the beach wonderful? Isn't this air-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plane trip going to be perfectly ducky?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She went on approving of this and that for some time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">You'd a thought Webster didn't agree with her. He didn't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">utter a word. I could see why the little lady got angered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at my cloud-hopper. Lord, a man ought to say something</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to a woman, even if he is in love with her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"T SHALL call my play 'Souls of the Ether,"' she</seg><seg type="columnLine">-J- continued. "What do you think of it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Her eyes twinkled invitingly and the lips still pouted as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Webster remained dumb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I nudged him viciously with my elbow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Say 'exquisite,' " I whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Exquisite," Webster gasped, and then looked frightened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"O--oooo," she squealed, "that's s-o-o-o nice of you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">T've never heard maple sugar trickling over a bed of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rock candy, but that's what her voice sounded like to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Webster was a lucky dog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"If I could only think of more words to say like that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">28</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Flying Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe I'd have a chance," Webster told me later. "She</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to like that one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll write you a list," I promised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon the truck drove up with Old Joe. I placed my</seg><seg type="columnLine">camera nearby and was ready for some good preliminary</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots. Then the boy who seemed to be in charge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair booted me farther back and made every one else fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low. He said that Old Joe was in a bad mood and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">liable to eat innocent bystanders. I whispered to the boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was carrying the deception too far, but he ignored</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Maybe he hadn't been let in on the idea that Hymie</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the cage and not Old Joe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally, a chute like they use for animals in a circus</seg><seg type="columnLine">was placed against the specially built cage that was lashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the second cockpit near the tail. Helene posed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment, smiled and then climbed into die front cockpit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A second later the pilot entered the second cockpit and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate of die chute was opened. There was a sullen roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was pretty good for Hymie and a dark object lumbered</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the cage on the plane. The prop was spun and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane took off, circling for altitude above the beach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I CLIMBED into my plane, which was ready, and Web-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster had soon gained altitude and was following close</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the movie ship. I trained my camera on the plane and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered, for an instant, if perhaps I could have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistaken in Hymie. He had certainly looked the part, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief instant I had seen him. Old Joe, himself, couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done much better. I dismissed this generous thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">and laid the success of the ruse to the fact that a super-make-</seg><seg type="columnLine">up man had done the job.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene looked up at us and waved a dainty hand. Web-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster almost threw the ship into a tail spin lie was so tickled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the idea hit me that as a business proposition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this flight of mine wasn't going to turn out so good. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't let me get any decent ground shots and I wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting anything exciting up in the air. I had just about</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to turn back when strange things began to happen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I changed my mind. The plane ahead of us bobbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wavered. For a moment, it looked like something had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone wrong with the controls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I figured that Hymie had changed position in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cage and had thrown the plane off balance. It was a silly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunt anyway. The plane hadn't been made to carry such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a load and I began to worry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then die front of the cage crashed open and a hairy</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm was extended. Soon a huge form crept out onto the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuselage, balancing precariously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What has gone wrong with the idiot?" I asked myself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Has he suddenly gone insane and got the notion that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a wing-walker ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The answer to my question froze die blood in my veins</seg><seg type="columnLine">and almost knocked me out of the cockpit. Webster ducked</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer to the movie plane and the thing on the fuselage</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned its face toward me. I knew that it wasn't Hymie</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garfinkle. Neither was it any man dressed like an ape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The creature crouching against the force of the wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and baring ugly teeth in a snarl was Old Joe himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could see by Old Joe's snarl and the way he shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head that he was sore as a boil at what had been done</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. I knew that Old Joe was hell incarnate when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt diat way, and now he was afraid and that made it</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse. No telling what he would do now. I hoped every</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute that he'd fall off and thus prevent what was certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">to happen in a minute, if he kept his footing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Joe stood still a second, shaking his head from side</seg><seg type="columnLine">to side in anger and then he started to inch his way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cockpit in which sat the pilot, unconscious of his danger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ship ducked again and I could see the pilot working</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the controls. He knew something was wrong but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">just what. The girl hadn't looked back either.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just then Webster saw what was going on and he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy. He dived low over the movie plane, as if to brush</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Old Joe off. That made the ape angrier than ever and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ensuing roar caused the pilot to look backward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was close enough to catch the expression on the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. I've never seen such fear written on human flesh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stared, fascinated, at Old Joe's snarling face and dien</seg><seg type="columnLine">sagged forward in the cockpit as his plane banked steeply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw that it wouldn't be but a second before the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">would crash. I cursed Hymie Garfinkle and the crazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme which was about to cause the death of a pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman and a more or less efficient pilot. Even the ape</seg><seg type="columnLine">was worth more than Hymie, I told myself, as I watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing beneath me and tried to figure out how the ape</seg><seg type="columnLine">had got into the cage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I breathed easier for a moment. The pilot snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of it and pulled the stick back, in time to avoid a spin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He ducked forward in the cockpit as if to avoid the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in back of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For God's sake! Spin, loop, anything to shake him</seg><seg type="columnLine">off!" I howled, but of course no one heard me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Joe got into action just then. He moved closer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pilot, braced his feet in a half sitdng position and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed over the cockpit for an instant. Suddenly, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned forward and grasped the pilot around the shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hairy arms. There was a brief struggle and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">something shot downward from the plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Joe swayed over the open cockpit for a moment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then crawled within.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked at the twisting body of die falling pilot and half</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut my eyes in horror. The ocean was below but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall would kill him anyway. Just as it all seemed over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">something white shot upward and blossomed into a para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chute. The pilot was safe, anyway. I thanked providence</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there were still a few sensible fliers left. Webster also</seg><seg type="columnLine">always wore a parachute. They come in handy in cases</seg><seg type="columnLine">like diat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned my attention to the other plane. Old Joe had</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed into the cockpit and had hold of the stick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I understood what was making the ape's brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">click. We had made a comedy with him and had used him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cockpit of a dummy plane. He had been taught</seg><seg type="columnLine">to jiggle the stick and kick the rudder bars. The thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come back to him and he was doing what he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">taught</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The plane was turning in crazy circles now. It couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be long before the crash. Old Joe was bouncing up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in high glee. He was no longer afraid and his anger</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gone. He had always liked the movie plane and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was happy now. His hairy arms jerked the stick from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left to the right and then he shoved it forward. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail whipped from side to side and then the nose snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward, turning swiftly. The propeller was sucking it</seg><seg type="columnLine">oceanward with terrifying speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T SAW Helene's yellow hair streaming backward. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and seen what had taken place--that the pilot</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gone; that Hymie wasn't in the plane and that a real</seg><seg type="columnLine">ape was her sole companion. She had fainted with a shriek</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could almost hear and I was relieved a little to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that her troubles were over. She wouldn't feel die terri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fying fear of the sudden plunge downward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shut my eyes as the plane neared the water and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened them in amazement as the plane leveled off. Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe had done the right thing by some miracle. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoved forward on the stick and then eased it gendy back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course he didn't know what he was doing but anyway, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ship pancaked upon the surface of the water and</seg><seg type="columnLine">plowed forward through the swells. It stopped undamaged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apparently the girl was safe, unless Old Joe became an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered again. I was debating whether or not it would do</seg><seg type="columnLine">any good if we made a landing on the surface and sacri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficed my ship to the ocean, when my plane dipped forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and something began falling away from it. In a second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Mystery of the Hidden Pilot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">29</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">something white billowed upward and Webster was dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling on the end of the thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lad had hopped overboard with a parachute and left</seg><seg type="columnLine">me alone with the plane. I figured he could, at least, have</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned me of his plan and tried to get my ship under</seg><seg type="columnLine">control again. It was all I could do to get the thing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horizon again, but I finally did it. I had to. By the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I had the crate in hand, Webster had landed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water near the stranded plane. He cut the 'chute belt</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swam to the movie ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked for trouble from Old Joe, but the ape seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be perfectly satisfied to fuss with the controls and hop</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and down in the cockpit. I knew there'd be no trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him, from then on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T BANKED and started back toward shore. To my sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise, I learned that everything had taken place in</seg><seg type="columnLine">darned short time. We had not flown far from the beach.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those on shore had seen what happened and had sent out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">power-boat already. The pilot of the movie plane and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other two would be picked up soon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In landing my plane, I plowed up half an acre of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach and came to a stop when I washed out my under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">carriage. It was far from a three-point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I walked toward the group on the beach, the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">face I saw was Jessup's. He was white as milk and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face streamed sweat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the hell's the idea?" I asked, "sending a woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with that ape? I'm gonna sock you plenty. Next time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure some other way of making money than by risking</seg><seg type="columnLine">other persons' lives."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He grew whiter and started to talk. I was going to paste</seg><seg type="columnLine">him anyway just for the ducks of the thing, when I under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood what he was saying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He claimed that he hadn't known anything about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal. He said that Hymie had doublecrossed him and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing was done without hrs consent. I believed him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jessup isn't that kind of a man, but I would believe any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of Hymie. He's the kind of a lad who'd throw rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">into an orphan asylum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just then Hymie's ugly mug showed at the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd and I saw red. I got him by the collar and dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">him out in the clear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I tried to make up like an ape but I couldn't," he whim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered. ''I figured it would be just as good publicity to let</seg><seg type="columnLine">them take Old Joe. Then I was going over to the Island</seg><seg type="columnLine">by boat and have Old Joe taken back secretly. After that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was going to claim that it was me all the time. I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">think--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I figured that right there was the proper place to end</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that sentence. I punctuated it with a straight right that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was my masterpiece. Hymie sprawled like a sack of old</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just then Jessup caught my arm and I whirled on him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Next time--" he began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shut up or you'll get the same," I said.

His slitted eyes were glued to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blazing skies above him. His face was pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maturely lined with deep gashes, cut there by the grim hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">of searing, soul-sickening war; his black hair was streaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with grey over his temples. Major Cox was a young man</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown old early. He had gazed into many bleeding skies</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as he was peering thoughtfully into now; and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen many battle-marked ships come limping in from dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerous patrols over enemy territory, such as the swooping,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wavering, crippled crate which lashed down wildly now</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a landing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But also, the weary, cold-eyed S. C. of the fighting, fear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less Ninth Pursuit Squadron had waited times without num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber for certain of his pilots to wing down out of the blue--</seg><seg type="columnLine">times when the red-white-and-blue circle-marked wings that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had borne some laughing, mocking youngster aloft did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">return. Major Cox would finally go slowly back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operations tent and place a gold star after the name of an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other pilot who had lofted buoyantly upon his last flight--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a patrol into the West, from which none ever returned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, late into the night, the major would sit hunched over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his littered desk in operations tent and write a letter to</seg><seg type="columnLine">another gold-star mother back in the States. Tears from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the major's tired eyes always were sealed in the envelopes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">along with his penned condolences. He knew that he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">would never grow hardened to losing his nervy, fearless</seg><seg type="columnLine">war-birds. He knew that every time one of them fell before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the belching Spandaus of an enemy pilot he would feel the</seg><seg type="columnLine">agony of the loss as poignantly as though it were his first</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience of the kind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The major's joy was correspondingly great when he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar silver wings pointing out of the ether over no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's land, and come slithering down to the Ninth's tarmac.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then his heart would leap and his thin lips would twist in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a silent prayer of thanks to the gods of the dangerous air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways. He would return to operations tent and smile con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentedly as he plunged into the mass of work that was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways piled up for him there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HPHE pilots of the Ninth Squadron often laughed among</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves about the squadron commander's solicitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">about them, but deep in their hearts they appreciated it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One day patrol leader "Cliff" Andreas put into words all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their thoughts about Major Cox. He was sitting in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">"roost," talking and drinking with the steel-muscled, hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed members of his flight The S.

Cliff Andreas roared in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumbling throaty voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gosh-all-fish-hooks!" he said. "Cox sure gives me the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">30</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                       Z7 liY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                             ^ CARL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                             : ZIEGLER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Thrilling Sky Fights of a CommanderXi^ho Met^, the Enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Single-handed to SaveP His Boys</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">weary-willies at tirues.

When things get the hottest up there, I seem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see those eyes of his'n, and they always put new heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">into me, for some reason. But, Gawd, how it's gettin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my nerves!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The leader of "D" flight picked up a large brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle and filled his glass anew with stinging cognac.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He drained it at a gulp. The silence that ensued was</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally broken by "Red" Falkner. Falkner had been with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ninth only a little over a week. He came up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pool at Issoudun fresh from his training at Kelly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Field. The war was new to him and so he saw every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about him with a fresher vision than did the</seg><seg type="columnLine">veterans of the outfit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">44 C AY," he spoke softly. "The Skipper reminds me of</seg><seg type="columnLine">^ something diat I have often seen back home. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">guys know I'm a westerner. Well, I've ridden through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hills of my Dad's ranch many a day and come across</seg><seg type="columnLine">an old eagle teaching its young brood to rustle for itself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I used to get quite a kick out of watching them. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">old eagle would push the young ones out of its nest and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know, they nest way up on some craggy height.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then it would circle about in the blue and watch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">youngsters flop, spin and tumble. The old one</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't help the young ones a bit, but would just fly</seg><seg type="columnLine">around and watch them, kind of proudlike. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know that they would make out all right. Well," Red</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced about the circle of interested faces and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on quietly, "Major Cox reminds me of that eagle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He watches us guys as we test our wings; and I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">he, too, like that old bird, is proud of the record of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ninth--mighty proud."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," chimed in "Prof" Martin at this point, "you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have hit it pretty well, Red.

Martin had been an under-profes-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sor of psychology in a western college be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for the war. He prided himself upon the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fact that he could read the motives of men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He looked quickly about the group of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pilots and then went on with his diag-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nosis of the motives of their leader: "Since</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Cox had his foot put out of commission,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and he had to take a kiwi's berdi, he has</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been eating his heart out here on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ground.

He motioned with a sweep of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm for the rest to fill up their glasses again. When he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done so, he raised his glass aloft and spoke again. His voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">was soft with feeling a3 he continued:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's drink," he said, "to the best old S.

He could barely see the ground through his blearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. His breath was coming in sickening wheezes through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tight-stretched lips. His hands were shaking on the joy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick. His face was a death-mask of oil and blood. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost out, yet he knew he had to land the Spad. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Major Cox would be waiting down there on the tar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mac--waiting for the only surviving member of "D" flight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Andreas felt the wheels of his thundering crate kiss the</seg><seg type="columnLine">turf, at last. He straightened it out and taxied toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hangars. A group of medianics rushed forward at the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand of Major Cox and hauled the sleek, but machine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunned plane to a halt. The S. C. made his way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cockpit of the Spad and gently lifted the broken form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cliff Andreas to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Major Cox stretched the wounded patrol leader on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the turf of the tarmac, the latter looked up into his S. C.'s</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn face and muttered through cut, bleeding lips:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They got 'em all but me," he whispered. "I came back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to report to you--I just was able--to make it." Cliff's head</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell back upon Cox's arm. Pie conked out!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The commander of the Ninth gave the wounded pilot over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the care of the doctor who had rushed up with the ambu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lance which was always ready on the field. These "bone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scramblers" always seemed to sense when something was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong, long before the ships landed. It had been so in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">case. They had been prepared for the worst when they saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andreas' crate come wobbling down out of the blue. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted the broken form of the sky-rider and placed him ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derly upon a stretcher, and then shoved it gently into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of the ambulance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Major Cox turned away with bowed head and limped</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly toward the operations tent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dusk fell over the Ninth's tarmac and numerous candles</seg><seg type="columnLine">were lighted in the hangars and "roosts." Still Major Cox</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hunched over his littered table in the operations tent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A candle had been lighted by his "dog-robber" as darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell. Its wavering light played upon the white, lined face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the S. C. A tear-stained sheaf of papers was before him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Far into the night he labored over those missives that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear terrible news to waiting parents far across the seas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Major Cox composed the following missive and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">copied it six times, changing only the heading of each one</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the name of the crashed pilot:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ninth Aero Squadron, Fourth Pursuit Group</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                            A.

His feet faltered heavily as he tottered to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ships were warming up there; great, ghostly, winged</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures that hovered strangely, like huge birds of prey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ships that would streak down the runway soon upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual nightly patrols. Ships that would carry other young-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sters into those glowering skies over the front lines and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, would not bring them back again.

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was heavy-jowled and glowering; his eyes pools of ice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Full red lips were set in an unsmiling, straight line through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dark face. His arms were heavy and well muscled, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hairy hands short-fingered and powerful. Stan Lewdrop</seg><seg type="columnLine">had flown with the Ninth Squadron since America had en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered the War. Before that he had been with a squadron of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canadians. More victories were listed to his credit than to</seg><seg type="columnLine">any in the Ninth, except Major Cox. He was a nerveless</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting machine of the greatest efficiency and, many of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other pilots of the Ninth often whispered in his absence, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">without heart or soul.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes snapped and questioned as he focused them upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the squadron commander.

Have you noticed that?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Major Cox dropped his head upon his chest and studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground for a long moment before he answered. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he again raised his head, his eyes were shining like polished</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapiers in the gloom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have noticed it," he admitted. "I have known for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time that something had to be done to buck up our men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In fact, if something isn't done soon, we'll be out on our</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. God! I sure hate to see the look in our boys' eyes1</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they come in from meeting von Platen. Then, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">these messages that German drops after every big victory</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't helping things any. It has to be stopped!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Yeah," snorted Lewdrop throatily, "but how?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ti7"ELL," answered Cox, "I'll tell you how! See that</seg><seg type="columnLine">crate of Andreas' next to yours?" He pointed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense arm toward the second panting ship on the line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Uh huh," grunted Lewdrop as he cast a quick look be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That crate is the answer as to how I am planning to stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">von Platen," growled Major Cox. "I look for that guy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come over with his circus some time tonight. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes, he's going to get the surprise of his life. Up until</seg><seg type="columnLine">now we've been trying to 6top him with Archies. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't work. He conics swooping down from a high ceil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and goes back the same way. In that manner he escapes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ring of shrapnel we throw about the tarmac. He drops</seg><seg type="columnLine">his message and then beats it. He has been thumbing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose at us in this way for a long time. Tonight he's due</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a little surprise party."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wha'd'ye mean?" inquired the interested leader of "A"</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight. He searched the white face of the squadron com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mander intently. It told him little in the gloom that shrouded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tarmac like a pall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This," snapped the S. C. "I'm going up in that Spad of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andreas'. I'm going to lay way up in the ceiling until von</seg><seg type="columnLine">Platen flies his circus over this tarmac. He usually comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">over just before dawn. When he comes I'm going to slash</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into him. In the darkness, I should be able to do a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lot of damage to the Jerry circus before they get me. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, I have a bunch of hand grenades in that Spad's cock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit. With them, and the Vickers gun it is equipped with, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be able to bring down a goodly number of the Boche."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What!" growled the leader of "A" flight. "I thought you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were ordered not to fly. What about that bad foot of yours ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Do you think you can handle a plane that way? Better</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait until I come back from this damn mission I am to make,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'll give you a hand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Orders must be broken at times," said Cox. "This is</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the times that I'm going to break one. I am not go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to stay grounded and see my boys hacked to pieces. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know I can still handle a crate, by strapping my good foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the rudder bar. If I am shot down I won't be missed much</seg><seg type="columnLine">any way. There are a lot of squadron commanders, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty few good pilots. I'm going up just before dawn!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another long silence ensued between the two taut men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Captain Lewdrop stuck out his hand and roared:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, if you must go up, good luck to you, old-timer!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thanks," answered Cox, quietly. He shook Lewdrop's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand warmly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the leader of "A" flight jumped toward his Spad.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He revved up the Hisso for a moment, while his hawk eyes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the instrument board. He grunted in satisfaction</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he saw that everything was in good order. Then he mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned toward his waiting mechanic to pull the chocks. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were whisked from beneath the jumping wheels of the pant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Spad. Lewdrop fed the crate the gun and thundered</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the dark runway. He zoomed wildly into the funereal</seg><seg type="columnLine">void of the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">Major Cox watched him out of sight. Then he hobbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly over to the ship he was to fly in a few short hours.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His face was grim as he inspected the Spad, peering into its</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow cockpit to see if it was equipped with its load of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death-dealing grenades. Two grease and oil-smeared me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanics were reconditioning the crate. Major Cox spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them for a moment, and then went back toward the shad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">owy row of bunk-tents. He needed a few hours sleep be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he took off on his dangerous mission--before he met</seg><seg type="columnLine">the devilish von Platen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was in those eerie hours preceding dawn that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ninth's S. C. again made his way across the tarmac toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the line. He saw immediately that his Spad was warming</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, preparatory to his lofting into the dark skies. Cox's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were heavy and red-rimmed, his mouth was tight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained. He felt a tingle in his blood as he contemplated</seg><seg type="columnLine">again a joy-stick and feeling another slipstream whip</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The major gnawed a beef sandwich and sipped a tin of</seg><seg type="columnLine">scalding coffee. He was dressed in the flying clothes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had discarded a few short months ago at the order of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">superior officers. His goggles felt good as they rested on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his leather-helmeted forehead. His shoulders were braced</seg><seg type="columnLine">contentedly back in his leather, fleece-lined coat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Major Cox limped up to the line he met the startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">look in the eyes of the mechanics there with a smile. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded toward the Spad on the line and spoke to a sergeant</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was in command of the troop of mechanics on duty:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Everything in shape, Sergeant?" he asked softly. "Think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that old crate will be safe for a cripple like me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir," the sergeant answered as he raised a grimy</seg><seg type="columnLine">paw in salute. "The major would be safe in anything. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">all know that there is none better at handlin' a joy-stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the major, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cox laughed metallically. Then he dropped his coffee</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin and crammed the remainder of his sandwiches into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth. He stepped up to the side of the gray fuselage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Spad. lie stroked it with his gauntleted hand as he lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened keenly to the rhythmic drone of its motor. A quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile hovered about his thin lips as he watched the final in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spection by the mechanics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Expert fingers snapped the wires between the Spad's wings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing a weird tune upon them, Knowing hands tested</seg><seg type="columnLine">struts and wings, and keen eyes swept undercarriage and tail</seg><seg type="columnLine">assembly. All was in order. The Spad was in readiness to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go aloft to meet von Platen and his circus of enemy war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    AJOR COX squeezed his lanky figure into the nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row cockpit of the Spad, and strapped his foot to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar. He grinned happily over the side of the battle-marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuselage at the waiting mechanics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pull the chocks!" he roared over the staccato thunder</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the motor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right!" answered the sergeant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blocks were whisked from under the straining wheels</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the plane. Cox then fed it the gun. The Spad moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly away from the line. As the S. C. poured the gun to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the willing crate it picked up speed and thundered down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">runway. Then, with his blood leaping in his veins, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">commander of the Ninth Squadron hauled back lustily upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stick and thundered into the funereal void of the heavens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Cox felt the Spad lift him to the heights he laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">unrestrainedly into the pitchy blackness about him. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiery eyes glanced keenly about him in the pitchy blackness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he gazed unafraid into the ominous pall of night which</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanketed the Ninth's tarmac and blotted the lofting plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">34</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Flying Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from the view of the men on the shrouded ground. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrestled with the controls of the plunging plane and climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for die pitchy ceiling. Every nerve in his tense body seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cry with the exultation of being in flight once more. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">face twitched with the feeling seething in his soul and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts that raced dirough his brain made his eyes feel red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rimmed and cold. He heaved a deep sigh of contentment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was satisfied now, for he was streaking toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloody stamping-ground of the heights. He was to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">von Platen in one last grim battle. If he lost, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have fought again, at least. If he won, well, he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved the morale of those sleeping boys in their quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">"roosts" on the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cox climbed the Spad until he had reached an altitude of</seg><seg type="columnLine">about 15,000 feet. Then he swept the crate into wide circles</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the heavens. He lurked beneadi the stars, a demon of</seg><seg type="columnLine">doom. To any watching eyes beneadi him he was cutting</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide swaths in the diamond fields of the higher regions. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced about him into the ghostly ether. Strange phantoms</seg><seg type="columnLine">materialized weirdly to his right and to his left, only to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sipate into the darkness as he swept upon them with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thundering, roaring, wire-shrieking Spad. The liurding</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipstream screamed and groaned about him. The cherry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">red exhaust below him made a staccato cacophony of fury</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he split through the blackness. He swept the inky hori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zon for a view of the expected Jerry jagdstaffel of von</seg><seg type="columnLine">Platen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T'HEN he!saw them, myriads of little fireflies coming out</seg><seg type="columnLine">-*■ of the north. The Jerries were flying at about 10,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. The lights of die enemy exhausts grew larger and</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer with the speed of light. Cox hunched over his con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trols and gunned his streaking crate. The phantom enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight was now circling high over the Ninth's tarmac.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The squadron commander pushed forward on his joy-stick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He nosed his Spad down for the back of the Boche jagdstaf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fel. Cox's eyes were mere slits in his face; his mouth a</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight red line. His right hand was a ball of bone and</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscle on the stick. The Yankee crate came out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling propelled by a thundering, roaring motor. Wires</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieked, struts moaned as the major struck the circling</seg><seg type="columnLine">jagdstaffel of the enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Jerries were sweeping down over the Yankee tarmac</seg><seg type="columnLine">under throtded power. A faint drum of motors, the swish</seg><seg type="columnLine">of batlike wings, the whine of strained struts were the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">things that disturbed the quiet of the night. The leader of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enemy flight must soon have realized the strangeness, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this night's reception. Unlike other nights, there were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">anti-aircraft guns barking into the heights or powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">searchlights piercing the gloom of the heavens. Von Platen</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have realized this and have swept the inky ground with</seg><seg type="columnLine">feverish, questioning eyes. He must have shuddered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">premonition as he thundered down closer over the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, no doubt, his eyes were drawn abrupdy to the heights,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Cox was coming down under full power on the back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his jagdstaffel. The American had thrown his crate into</seg><seg type="columnLine">die very midst of the enemy circus. The night was lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">widi crimson, licking flames and shattered with the furious</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarl of machine-guns; made hideous with the growl of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bursting grenades.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The high-flying, death-defying commander of the Ninth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Squadron went utterly berserk as he dug his fangs into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest Jerry crate. His mind was a blank except for one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. He saw the face of Chris Andreas as he lay in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms and whispered up at him; "They got them all but me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I came back--to report--to you." Then with a shudder Cox</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered how the youngster had fallen back into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms, unconscious. The broken body of Andreas seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">epitomize to Cox all those other youngsters who had lofted</seg><seg type="columnLine">into dangerous skies, to come back crushed and bloody or</seg><seg type="columnLine">not at all. Remembering all this, the grim pilot hurded his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spad into the enemy with all the fury at his command. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not look through his gun-sights; it would be useless to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do so. In the blackness of the night, those dead sights would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">be but empty round holes. The S. C. pointed the nose of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">crate straight at the first shadowy, sweeping form below</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and pressed down hard on his gun trips and kept them</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. With the first furious blast from his heating Vickers</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Jerry went down in flames.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah," he breathed into the stench of his cockpit, "I wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">those officious Brass Hats could see me now! God, it's good</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be up here--a real man again 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men poured from the hangars and bunk-tents upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yankee tarmac, and ran furiously toward the far end of die</seg><seg type="columnLine">field where the Jerry was burning. They lifted their eyes to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the shooting Spad. It was milling frenziedly among</seg><seg type="columnLine">black wings of wavering Hun planes. They lifted their fists</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the heavens. Their throats stretched to emit scorching</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasphemy. They moaned and cursed at the strange yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">subtly heartening fight against terrific odds in the skies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the mechanics who had come from die hangar</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to jibber and cry insanely. His nerve had broken.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He moaned over and over again above the roar of motors</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the skies, and die hiss of leaping flames on the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's up there--the major's up there. He's up there alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then other pilots and grease monkeys turned and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him. They shuddered. They glanced quickly from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">to another. All their faces turned white, drained of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">color. It was the first intimation they had had that Major</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cox had gone up alone to meet von Platen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then their heads were jerked back upon their shoulders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There now mingled with the whine of Spandaus and the snarl</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Vickers guns the harsher reports of bursting grenades.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Cox had zoomed toward his second ship he had reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his cockpit and drawn out a hand grenade. He primed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with his teeth. As he came up underneath the black belly</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the second enemy crate he pressed down hard on his gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">trips for a series of short bursts, then releasing diem, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown a grenade with all his might into the whirling prop</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the black-winged plane as he swept by and up and beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. It shot down, immediately. Then he twisted in a tight</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank--a dizzy, head-twirling bank--dropped the nose of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spad and shot toward another enemy, spraying it with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">death-dealing guns. Again his right hand went into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths of his cockpit. Again it flashed forth with death in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its sweaty palm and his teeth primed another grenade. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm shot over the side of his cutting fuselage and another</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jerry crate was shattered by the concussion of die fatal</seg><seg type="columnLine">grenade as it struck and exploded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HfHE major was grinning fiercely into the ripped indigo</seg><seg type="columnLine">skies as he swept his eyes to the right and the left of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tiirashing crate. The slipstream whipped the blood to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lined face. Every nerve in his body was tense to the break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing point His vision was filled with whirring black wings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His brain was a seething Hades where death hatched in</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly ghastliness. He thrashed his crate about recklessly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dived into the bottom of his cockpit and snapped erect</seg><seg type="columnLine">again with another grenade. His shoulders snapped back</seg><seg type="columnLine">determinedly as he whirled to meet another enemy crate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The circus of von Platen had been utterly disorganized.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The enemy crates were swirling about the blasted ether</seg><seg type="columnLine">like demented beings in a black helL In crazy zooms, banks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crazier reverses they were desperately trying to reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heights again, and to streak back to the north from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had come; but, due to the fact that they did not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the enemy lurked or when he would strike, they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not adequately maneuver their plunging ships and put their</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan into effect. They did not dare blaze away with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spandau guns as recklessly as as they would have liked for</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear of striking down a friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Major Cox was here, there and everywhere. Until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck, the enemy did not know whether he was a friend or</seg><seg type="columnLine">foe. Undisturbed, he got in his death-dealing blows</seg><seg type="columnLine">-efliciendy and quickly. Ship after ship left the air over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ninth's tarmac to crash to the hard ground. The Jerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilots were becoming desperate, crazy with fear. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">.whirled and swooped and twisted and turned, crazily and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wings of Peril</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">35</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dizzily, trying to escape the scoring death in their midst.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still Cox held on, blazing away with his Vickers gun and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurling grenades.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the men on the ground were struck speechless with</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror. Von Platen, leader of the night-raiding Jerry flight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had singled out Cox in his Spad. He swooped for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American's tail. Both ships whirled toward the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now they were away from the rest of the milling crates.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were illuminated by the light cast by the crates burn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on the ground. Startled men, standing with uplifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">white faces on the tarmac of the Ninth Squadron, saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cox and von Platen were in a last, terrific death-grapple.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One or the other of them must kiss the dust--one or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other of them must go down 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"T^rOW," he snarled harshly into the blasting slipstream,</seg><seg type="columnLine">'I "we'll see if a crippled kiwi can whip a lousy square-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head." He laughed. "I'll be grounded for a million lifetimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">for flying tonight, but von Platen is going to ground for</seg><seg type="columnLine">eternity 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Major Cox's face was a white death-mask. Every nerve</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his lean body was torn by the battle. He hauled back on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stick, hauled the Spad up on its tail, held it there quiver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for a long moment, then dropped onto his back. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured full gun to the old crate and went at the enemy ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his tail, on his own back. He pressed down on his gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">trips and held them down. Hot steel pierced the flame-lit</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. Hot steel found the enemy's cockpit! Von Platen had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been taken by surprise. He cut his throttle and dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his crate away from the onrushing Yankee. Then Cox</seg><seg type="columnLine">winged over, straightened out and came back on von Platen's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both crates circled about in battle formation, in a wide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweeping turn, creeping up expertly onto each other's tail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The two warbirds swooped and twirled. The other German</seg><seg type="columnLine">crates had turned tail and flown north, afraid to attack for</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear of doing harm to their leader. The air was free now</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the greatest batde ever witnessed by the weary, tense</seg><seg type="columnLine">men on the ground, who had seen many encounters in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">eventful days at the front.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Major Cox soon learned that he was at a disadvantage in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this fight with the efficient German, because of his bad foot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but then as he crept closer and closer to the crate ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he reached forward and grasped his gun trips. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumbed them. Burst after burst streaked through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skies toward the Jerry crate. Yet they fell short. Von</seg><seg type="columnLine">Platen, grinning back through the murk, lit with crimson</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames, grinned mockingly at the desperately fighting Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can behind him. Yet there was more than mockery in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boche's eyes--respect and fear mingled in their depths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the Jerry leafier hauled his crate back into a dizzy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy Immelmann. Straight for the spinning prop on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose of the Spad he flew. Spandaus were spitting in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">frenzy. The enemy's steel reached the American ship. Von</seg><seg type="columnLine">Platen raked the Spad from stem to stern as he whirled by.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cox's stricken plane wavered and then slipped off crazily</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sickeningly upon its left wing. Von Platen came thun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering back, snapping and snarling on the tail of the Yan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kee ship 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> White-faced men on the ground dared not look into that</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazing, fearsome ether, for they knew that they would see</seg><seg type="columnLine">their beloved S. C. coming down to a crash landing. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">shout made them look again and a cheer arose, for another</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane had thundered down into the dog-fight between Cox</seg><seg type="columnLine">and von Platen. With shouts of glee the men on the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook their hands vehemently toward that new diving crate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lewdrop, who had been delayed longer than he had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected on his midnight patrol, zoomed down out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heights just as von Platen found Cox's ship with one last</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroying blast from his hot Spandaus. Lewdrop saw Cox</seg><seg type="columnLine">waver and then slide off onto a broken left wing. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">red 1 He knew that the S. C. was in a desperate condition.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He gunned his motor and climbed down onto von Platen's</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. He caught the German unawares and raked the black</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy crate with one long blasting spew from his eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vickers gun. The Jerry leader went down in flames. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Lewdrop whirled about in a deep bank, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Cox.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw the major land. The shaky, but exultant S. C.</seg><seg type="columnLine">got within fifty feet of the ground before he could straighten</seg><seg type="columnLine">out his crate. It steadied for a moment at his touch on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrashing controls, then dropped in a pancake landing. Lew-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop swept down after him, bounced to a landing, cut his</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor and jumped out of the cockpit before his plane had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to a stop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He whirled and followed the group of pilots and mechanics</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were rushing toward the squadron commander's Spad.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As Lewdrop rushed up, it burst into flames. The belching</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames swept back the pilots and mechanics into a huddled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrified group. Lewdrop burst through them and rushed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the flame-belching ship. The Spad was on its back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cox was hanging out of his cockpit suspended by his safety</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt Lewdrop braved the flames. They licked out greedily</seg><seg type="columnLine">and singed his hair and eyebrows. The flesh of his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">withered before their scorching breath. He struggled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the safety belt that imprisoned Cox and finally felt the lean</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of the squadron commander fall into his waiting arms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He dragged the S. C. back from that burning Spad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Major Cox was unconscious. As a nervous doctor jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of an ambulance that had thundered up to the scene and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned over him, his eyes flew open and he recognized his</seg><seg type="columnLine">surroundings. He grinned up weakly into the faces lean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over him in a breathless circle He croaked in a voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">that seemed to come from the grave itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got him," said the blistered lips of the Ninth's comman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der. "Von Platen won't chalk up any more victories over our</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys. Got him--even if he did--get me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cox fell back into Stan Lewdrop's arms and went out</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. The doctor leaned quickly over him and made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick, efficient examination. He got up and faced the anxious</seg><seg type="columnLine">group about him and said with a confident smile:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He'll pull through, boys." He nodded sagely as he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the look of relief on their faces. "He's got a nasty scratch in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shoulder, but the shock of such a fight as he put up, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then crashing has hurt him more than his shoulder wound.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He'll be all right in a half hour or so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night the Ninth Squadron threw a binge They</seg><seg type="columnLine">lingered over their supper in the officer's mess tent. Bottle</seg><seg type="columnLine">after bottle of champagne was broken out. The war-worn</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilots began to laugh more naturally again. That metallic</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that had been in their voices during the early</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours before dawn, when they had witnessed that desperate</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog-fight between Cox and von Platen's jagdstaffel, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone now. They smiled proudly as they looked down toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head of the table where the major was seated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stan Lewdrop arose to his feet. He lifted a full glass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">champagne toward the ceiling. He roared in a throaty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick voice: "On your feet, buzzards," he cried, "let's drink</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the damnedest, snappiest, nerviest squadron commander in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the A. E. F. A guy who will fly in spite of hell! A guy</seg><seg type="columnLine">who will fly in spite of orders 1 A guy who will go up</seg><seg type="columnLine">single-handed to bring down von Platen's whole circus!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EVERY man was on his feet and all glasses were raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the ceiling. As Stan Lewdrop finished, every</seg><seg type="columnLine">man roared his concurrence to the captain's views:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yea! Yea!" they howled in chorus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When quiet reigned again Lewdrop went on: "Drink to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guy, buzzards, that will fly to meet death and hell itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his buddies, Major Cox!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They drank. Then with one gesture the thin glasses which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had held the champagne were all crashed on the floor. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumped down into their chairs again, and more champagne</seg><seg type="columnLine">was brought in. The binge was on. They had earned it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Major Cox smiled wanly but contentedly as he saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense, nervous gleam that lately had lurked in them, fade</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the eyes about the long table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was satisfied to stay grounded now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">w;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">L</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Flv?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ant to X^earn to 1 ly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flying Stories is Going to Help You</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fJ1IIIS magazine is going to do something no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">publication has ever done, and that is to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">you,free, beginning with the July issue, a complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground course in flying.

Jimmy asked, instantly, going to the root of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the matter without delay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How about tomorrow?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gee, that's great," said Jimmy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Diver grinned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Watch out for him, Jimmy. He's not a safe flyer. He's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">likely to lose flying speed right over the field."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> True to his promise, Dusty greeted Jimmy at the hangar</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on the following afternoon. He was revving his mono-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plane, with a trained ear cocked to catch the least variation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the even song of the engine. Jimmy stood back, watch-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "All right, kid," Dusty shouted over the staccato drone of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the idling motor. From a locker near the wall, he took a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">leather helmet and a jacket of the same material. They were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">much too large for Jimmy, but he slid into them quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Climb up," the pilot directed. "We'll wheel her out,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">directly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Obediently, Jimmy went up to the little step and crawled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into the cockpit. Before him was a curved wind-shield to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">protect his face from the rushing air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He twisted around in the low weather seat to stare aft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Behind him was the pilot's seat where Dusty would direct</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their flight. While he waited, Jimmy busied himself in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a study of the dual controls that were revealed in his tiny</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">compartment. Suddenly, the pilot was beside him, stand-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing on the little rung that was placed in the fuselage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep your hands off that stuff," he shouted, smiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Are you all set?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gee, sure!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy's heart fluttered as he saw Dusty crawl into his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">place. Below, a mechanic kicked out the chocks from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wheels at the pilot's signal. The engine raised its voice</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to a tcrrific roar. Jimmy stared back into the grinning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">face of the pilot as they moved out to the field. Dusty</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">switched off, and the silence was intense as the engine died.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Keep your head in, sou. Here we go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In one respect, Jimmy found this flight different from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his first, with Dip Reynolds. On that occasion, he had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">devoted himself entirely to watching the earth below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, Jimmy's interest was centered in the dual controls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Once they were in the air, he ceased to look down. In-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stead, he watched the rudder-bar as Dusty kickcd it over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for a bank. Or, he studied the stick as they climbed or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pointed down. He marveled at the deliberate slowness of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their action, and at the swift response that came instantly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from ailerons and rudder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every time he looked out, Jimmy experienced strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">little thrills that were unlike anything he had known. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">his boyish way he tried to analyze them. He was instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain that it wasn't fear. Even when Dusty sent her</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in a long dive, he was not afraid. To be sure, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and regarded Dusty with gleaming, excited eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was not fear that he felt. It was elation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carefully he stretched his legs and settled his feet lightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the rudder-bar. In this way he could feel the</seg><seg type="columnLine">action when Dusty turned on either wing. After a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments of this, he dropped his hand easily on the stick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful to offer no resistance when it shoved ahead or</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled back. He soon discovered that the plane moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the stick, likewise the rudder-bar. But he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware that Dusty felt the weight of his hands and feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">011 the controls. Neither did he know that the pilot was</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling to himself in his cockpit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They circled presendy, and headed back for the distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">field. Long before they were over it, Jimmy made out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hangars and began to take an interest in the landing. Dusty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the true caution of an old pilot, circled down easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">and came to a three-point landing, as gently as a baby</seg><seg type="columnLine">carriage descends from step to paved walk. They turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and taxied in toward the line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their arrival at the field office was much like the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">that followed his flight with Dip Reynolds. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">repetition of the joking remarks and more praise for Jimmy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With two flights to his credit, it was only natural that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy should venture up again and again in the course</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the summer at the field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mingling with the flyers day after day, he learned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lingo of their craft and studied the natures of these eagles</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were forever laughing at death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the while, Jimmy sold his papers, gladly cashing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the extras when a flyer made his goal; sadly when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was claimed by the shadows of the unknown heights. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, Jimmy's talk was of flying and flying men, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he became the envy of his friends in the gang and pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessed the strange, worried respect of his father and mother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's getting crazy on the subject," Mrs. McCray told</seg><seg type="columnLine">her husband one night, as she came from Jimmy's room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's sound asleep up there--rolling around in his bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelling 'contact'--'contact.' Now v/hat does it mean? I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">worried sick about him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But John McCray, himself a skilled mechanic, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"T ET him alone, Martha. It's the coming thing. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to be dangerous--those planes--but they're getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">them down now so they're safe as the railroads."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy's mother paused in her evening labors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know he's saving money to take lessons?" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded. "Every week he puts some in the savings bank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I declare, he won't buy anything for himself. Every penny</seg><seg type="columnLine">has to go for his flying lessons."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man nodded, smiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure. And what he doesn't save, I'll give him myself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can see Jimmy right now, a great man. Like Lindbergh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. McCray's eyes lightened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, maybe," she admitted. "Jimmy's just as good</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Lindbergh ever was, I'm sure--if he only had a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessons."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her husband laughed and placed his big hand gently on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meanwhile, Jimmy slept. In his dreams he was fly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his own ship. He saw himself as he had seen pictures</seg><seg type="columnLine">in lithographs of Lindbergh, with his hair whipping in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind, his face streaked with grease, his blue eyes gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">out across the steel-colored sweep of the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His mind had been particularly inflamed at the field that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stunt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Stuff</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">45</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">day by an announcement on the bulletin-board in the office.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had consisted simply of the laconic statement that an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspector would come the following day to test student</seg><seg type="columnLine">applicants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy had examined his pass-book carefully. His bal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance in the savings bank would just about pay for ten les-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons. When they were passed, if he made good, he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be ready for the inspector on his next visit. He enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained no doubts as to his ability. So now, in his dreams,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was flying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At breakfast, Jimmy said nothing of his plans to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now do be careful, son," she warned him, as she always</seg><seg type="columnLine">did when he started away. "Every time I pick up a paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">I expcct to see you've been killed in one of those crazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">things."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't worry, Mums. The only danger's in stunt stuff."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XJE kissed her and left the house, hurrying immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the bank where he drew out his money. Jimmy knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, that he might learned to handle the controls under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guidance of his friends at the field. But he had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided early to pay his way and attain his goal as a pilot</seg><seg type="columnLine">by recognized and official methods. From his friends he ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cepted flights and encouraged, occasionally a bit of valuable</seg><seg type="columnLine">information. But he intended to do his actual, student fly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with a paid instructor. That was Jimmy's way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accordingly, he set out for the field this morning with</seg><seg type="columnLine">high hopes, his blood singing in his veins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oddly enough, the student instructor was the one man</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the field with whom Jimmy had little in common.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To begin with, because he charged for flights, Tom Blake</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not in the habit of taking up 'dead heads.' For this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was not to be criticized. But nevertheless, with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen, boyish instinct, Jimmy sensed something in the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he did not like.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps it was because Blake refused to take him seri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously. Jimmy felt, when the man looked at him, that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was laughing. Likewise, in a vague fashion, he distrusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blnke and, while nothing had been said directly, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be a wall between the instructor and the veterans</seg><seg type="columnLine">who used the field. There was no doubt expressed as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ability in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy approached him this morning with a new degree</seg><seg type="columnLine">of confidence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd like to start lessons, Mr. Blake--when you've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">time for me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The instructor regarded him with amusement in his gaze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean you want to learn to fly, Jimmy? I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">you knew all about it--the way you've been going up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">all these birds around here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy smiled, a little embarrassed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir, I want to learn. I don't know anything about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it--yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blake laughed and it sounded as though a sneer was lurk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the background of his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, well. I'll be glad to take you. How'll you do--</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay as you go along?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I'll pay the whole thing in advance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy thrust a hand into his pocket and withdrew a</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll of bills. Blake's eyes glistened slightly and he became</seg><seg type="columnLine">more interested, a little more deferential.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can start today, if you want, Jimmy. This after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine. I'll be right here, Mr. Blake."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You better not eat lunch, Jimmy. It's different when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're at the controls, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A thin note of scorn crept into the taunt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I'll take a chancc," Jimmy told him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he went back to the office to sort the early editions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy found himself disliking Blake more than ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So he thinks I'm afraid," Jimmy mused. "He figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll be sick--if I take the controls. Huh, Blake's due for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a surprise."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In die meanwhile, Blake joined a group of men in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office beyond Jimmy's stand. The boy could hear their</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices, but until he heard his own name mentioned, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too deep in his thoughts to heed them. At that however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stood upright and deliberately listened. Blake was do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the talking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah," he said, with a short laugh, "the kid came out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a roll, all set to fly. You birds have spoiled him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's got a swelled head before he's touched a stick. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve me, I'll take that out of hint.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy recognized Dip Reynolds' voice in reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't fool yourself, Blake. That kid's got the stuff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He'll fly wilh any of us after he's done a hundred hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">solo. He's a natural flyer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go on," scornfully, "you're full o' hop. The kid's been</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoiled around here until he thinks he's Lindbergh. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">bet you a dinner he comes down white around the gills."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's a bet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll take that bet--and make it a suit o' clothes." Devoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the new offer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, that's on. Any more?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy scowled to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've stunted with him," Reynolds continued. "You can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">scare him that way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you ever let him have the stick?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I didn't. But I wouldn't be afraid to, in a dual-</seg><seg type="columnLine">control ship like yours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blake's laugh sounded again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I'll eat heavy and wear good clothes on you two,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he announced, "because this afternoon, I'm going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn the stick over to the kid, You remember the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">army trick, don't you? Sling your own stick overboard</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and let the student handle her alone. Well-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What'll you do if he passes out on you?" demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">Devoe. "That's a dirty trick, Blake. After all, he's only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a kid."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What'll I do?" asked Blake. ' Why I'll grab his stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bring her down--and collect from you birds."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outside, Jimmy turned to his stack of newspapers. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a sinking sensation in the pit of his stomach, for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that Blake intended to carry out his plan. Somehow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy told himself fiercely, he would have to beat Blake</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his own game--that, or be a laughing stock among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flyers and cause his two best friends to lose their wagers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Somehow he would have to be worthy of their faith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When most of the men were at lunch, leaving the han-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gars almost deserted, Jimmy ventured in to examine Blake's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. He had chosen his time carefully. It was a two-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seater, dual-controlled monoplane, painted a glittering red.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The slim lines of the fuselage spoke silently of speed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big, whirlwind engine told of power and endurance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE spent a moment or two in the passenger cockpit and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came down, to stand admiringly beneath the wings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently, with a serious expression on his lean, tanned</seg><seg type="columnLine">young face, he went to the lunch-stand and ate a hearty meal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Returning, he met Blake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, are you all set, Jimmy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir. I'm ready when you are."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you eat lunch?" Blake asked, grinning maliciously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure--a big one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're pretty cocky."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy was silent under the rebuff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, come on. Let's go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blake led the way to the hangar. Sketchily, he explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mechanics of the ailerons and the rudder. The boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened quietly. So engrossed did he become in the sleek</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane that he forgot his feelings about Blake and his vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneasiness at the prospcct of their flight. He followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man into the cockpit and received a brief lesson on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments--gadgets, Blake called them carelessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's your altimeter." He indicated a dial marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with numerals. "That tells you your height--or, it ought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to. There's die compass and that's the revolution counter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">46</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Flying Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Down here's your switch." There was evident contempt in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice, as one by one, he pointed out the instalments</seg><seg type="columnLine">and paused over each of them with laconic comment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You got it all now?" he demanded ''I suppose you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know all about them anyhow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, sir, but I'll learn."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right. Hop in. We'll soon find out"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy climbcd swiftly into his seat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now listen," said Blake. "There's .one thing you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to do. Keep your eyes on me and do exacdy what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. Don't yank on the controls. Handle them easy. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I signal to you to turn 'em loose, do it. Savvy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Remember now," Blake warned him again. "Do exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A T Blake's signal, a mechanic below pulled out the blocks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    The self-starter buzzed and the spark caught almost in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly. Jimmy's feet were on the rudder-bar, in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">position as Blake's. His hand gripped the stick lightly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He felt it move forward as the plane glided slowly out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instinctively, when they taxied to the line, Jimmy glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at the sock on the tall pole. The wind was coming from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the east. With a swift glance at Blake, he pressed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rudder and the ship turned into the wind. Then, as he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen the other pilots do, he jockeyed the stick as they sped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the wind, maneuvering to keep the nose of the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">down until precisely the right instant for the take-off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy laughed exultantly as they left the ground on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cushioned air. It was the old thrill intensified, owing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own share in the control. He turned and saw the field</seg><seg type="columnLine">below and behind them. A little group of men waved and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy responded. Blake shouted at him, unintelligibly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind, but he read his lips and more plainly, his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cut it out! Watch what you're doing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That, Jimmy decided instantly, was the best advice he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gotten from Blake yet. He proceeded to follow it. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense nerves thrilled as he felt the swing of the stick when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they pointed up in a long climb. A thousand feet, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">still they were aiming at the clouds. Two thousand, three--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stick jockeyed and they straightened off. Suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy's foot slipped as the rudder-bar was kicked and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane banked over sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gazed down across the wing, straight at the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then up along the gleaming surface of the other, directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into space. He grinned at Blake, exulting in the roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the engine, the song of the wind in the taut wires.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blakes centered the controls and they were on an even keel</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, roaring on a straightaway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four thousand--five--the altimeter needle shivered be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween five and six. For ten minutes they circled, like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great falcon, diving then straightening off to climb again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy was watching his instructor's movements with keen</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, responding to Blake's touch on the controls. He cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun and they idled in a vast universe where the throttled</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine scarcely sounded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the thing actually happened, Jimmy was totally</seg><seg type="columnLine">unprepared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blake reached down and jerked savagely at his stick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulling it from its socket He held it for an instant, so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that Jimmy might not, by any chance, fail to see his action.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, with a leer on his dark face, Blake tossed the stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the side. He leaned close and cupping his hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted in Jimmy's ear. "Now take her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wrench had sent the plane into a dive. Jimmy, staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, caught a last glimpse of the stick whirling toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. Bending low, in a movement so swift that the pilot</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not interrupt it, Jimmy pulled his own stick from</seg><seg type="columnLine">its place and shot it out into space. He looked up into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanched face of the instructor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a terrible instant, Blake was too shocked to act His</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips moved, but no sound came. His eyes widened in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed stare of horror and his face became ghastly white.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The plane was hurtling down with the engine on full speed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At such a time, facts register in a strangely detached way</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the human mind. Blake saw the faces of the instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments and read them subconsciously. They had fallen a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet. They were doing down at a hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ninety miles an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A piereing scream burst from the man's lips, and he raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands to shield his eyes from the sight of the rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. Up, up it came over the nose of the plane, until ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jects below were curiously distinguishable. They were over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stretch of dense timber, with the flying field far behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blake tore his shaking hands from his face to stare down</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and once more his lips opened a cry of terror.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, oddly, he sank forward in his safety belt, hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">limp, with his head sagging on his chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blake had passed into merciful unconsciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy reached swiftly down to the floor beside him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up with a stick which he thrust into the socket</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gently he drew it back to center, then centered the rud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der and the sturdy monoplane leveled off at two thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. Jimmy pointed back across the timber toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field. When he sighted the familiar hangars, the row</seg><seg type="columnLine">of planes on the line, he circled twice and nosed gently</seg><seg type="columnLine">down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Straining now, in his aftermath of fright, he straightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty feet above the field and edged down to a three-</seg><seg type="columnLine">point landing. Swinging the ship around, he taxied easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">in across the line and switched off. Blake still hung in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt, unconscious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T^IP REYNOLDS was the first to reach the plane. Close</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him came Dusty Devoe and half a dozen others.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On all their faces there was anger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the matter with you, Blake--pulling that stunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff on the kid?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dip spoke before he recognized the figure at the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trols. Then, his eyes widened. He stared at the limp</seg><seg type="columnLine">form in the cockpit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What--what the dickens, Jimmy? Were you doing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">nutty flying up there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," said Jimmy, grinning. "I couldn't help myself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blake threw his stick overboard, so I threw mine, too. Gee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it must have scared him. But I took an extra one along,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Reynolds. I wanted to play safe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pilots stared at him in amazement.

Far, far overhead, a predatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">buzzard circled, waiting for the desert to yield up its prey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Conroy noticed none of these things. He glanced back</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his three passengers, looked down at the bulky sack</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his side and pulled back the stick slightly for the sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy of feeling the ship respond to his touch. Conroy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so happy that it almost hurt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly there whirred down from nowhere, a high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">powered, ebony-black monoplane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pretty close," muttered Conroy. But it would take more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than some fool's reckless flying to disturb him on a day</seg><seg type="columnLine">like this. He stretched forth his hand to wave a friendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeting, when his smile froze to a ghastly grin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seated in the cockpit of the other plane, was a black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">masked pilot, one hand on the stick, and the other wrapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the trigger guard of a machine-gun. Conroy pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stick back hard, but the other was before him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">Immelmanned and circled at breakneck speed, coming into</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect combat position over Conroy's tail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A passenger's scream fought against the roar of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor.

Mercilessly, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">synchronized Lewis spat its couriers of death through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuselage. Three steel-jacketed bullets found their mark in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conroy's back as he seized the stick in a bulldog death grip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A fear-maddened passenger sought the wing, as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers groped with the cord of his parachute.

"When they want the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black Killer, they'll send a man after him--a flyer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused for a moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Like me," he added and walked through the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jerry glared after him in impotent rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Easy, son," counseled the superintendent again. "That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">just his way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And it was just Mad Michelson's way. He was the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpopular man on the field, retained only because he was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he boastingly proclaimed, a crack flyer--a stunting, fly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing fool with a dozen planes to his credit in the War.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JERRY sat 011 the bench as Davis attempted to calm him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The superintendent's brow was wrinkled in thought. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ell way Company, his chief rival, had relinquished the pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">senger and pay-roll service to Chihuahua because two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their planes had been crashed by a mysterious sky highway-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. The Ralston Company, hardly believing the story,</seg><seg type="columnLine">assumed the contract, and Conroy had taken out the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">run. Something had to be done. He lit an ominous look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing cigar as the telephone jangled again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke tersely into the receiver and looked up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a frown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jerry," he said. "It looks as if you'd get your chance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the passenger plane leaves Wednesday with the pay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll, you and Michelson are to go as escorts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jerry leapt up eagerly; his depression of a moment ago</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine, Super," he said. "The Lord knows I don't like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Michelson, but on a stunt like that, I guess he's the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">man on the field."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later on, Jerry climbed into the cockpit of his D. H.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and glanced at the throbbing Curtiss beside him. Michel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">con ignored him. With his lips set in a firm, hard line, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinkered with his synchronized machine-gun. Pulling back</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cocking handle on his own Lewis, Jerry pressed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trigger. With a sharp click, the striker shot forward into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the breech. Satisfied that all was in order, Jerry attached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the circular magazine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Contact," he shouted, and an oil-begrimed mechanic</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped to obey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Michelson, however, was a second before him. As Jerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">revved his motor, he watched Mad Michelson whip off into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind, his wheels barely touching the hard earth, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">zoom into the clear, summer sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jerry's Liberty pounded gaily on all her twelve cylinders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He jazzed the throttle and the plane's smooth, purring song</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed into a steady pulsating roar. He eased her down</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and swung his right hand in a half salute. Obeying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the traditional gesture, willing hands pulled away the blocks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the low squat hangars whizzed past him, as he dupli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated the perfect take-off of Mad Michelson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flattening out as his altimeter registered 3,000 feet, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Mad Michclson's plane about a mile in front of him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">speeding into the West like a migratory bird. Although</seg><seg type="columnLine">their last instructions had been to fly slowly and double</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to meet the mail plane, Jerry noted with some puzzle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment that the Curtiss ahead was running close to her maxi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mum speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Glancing at the instrument board, he found that his tacho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meter registered 10,000 revolutions per minute and that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">air speed was somewhat over ninety, with a slight tail</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind to help him along. There was something up Michel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son's sleeve!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maintaining this rate for some minutes, he suddenly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came aware of the gleaming, gray bird that was Mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">Michelson's ship, hurtling into the horizon leagues ahead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was winging on at top speed, using every ounce of</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength that its powerful engines could give.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jerry's sun-tanned brow wrinkled in thought. Michelson</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">knew the orders. What was he up to? For a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jerry hesitated. No matter what the other did, his orders</seg><seg type="columnLine">were his orders. It was his duty to follow them and render</seg><seg type="columnLine">protection to the plane that would soon follow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But some strange second sense bade him follow Michel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. The more he argued against it, the more the hunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">persisted. He cast his eyes around the great circle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon in search of some sign of the lumbering passenger</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship or the swift, almost mythical plane of the Black Killer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost instinctively, he made his decision. Jerking back</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stick and throwing the throttle wide open, he shot for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward and upward, as the slip stream belched a veritable</seg><seg type="columnLine">gale behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At 10,000 feet, he leveled his elevators and came out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his upward climb. Far down, in the distance, flashing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the golden sunlight, he saw Mad Michelson's plane, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue smoke from her exhaust spitting steadily as she main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained her terrific pace. He set his jaw grimly and fed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the D. H. all the gas she could eat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On, on he flew, the earth whirling by underneath, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though for him gravity had been suspended. Closer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer he drew to the ship of Mad Michelson which loomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger and larger at each spin of the prop. Over the border</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Utah, over the skyward-stretching Rockies, on and on--</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the arid Nevada wastes--on and on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gleaming Curtiss was now but a scant few miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of the sturdy roaring D. H. To his left Jerry saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lone mountain crag.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Charleston Peak," he muttered in surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the zest of the chase it was hard to realize that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had traveled so far--so fast. He was about three hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards behind Michelson as they pushed over the forbidding</seg><seg type="columnLine">canyon of Death Valley. In another mile he passed him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whirring by, he noted the look of surprise that settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the face of the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glanced back over his shoulder and saw the Curtiss,</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle, bank and volplane down toward the burning sands</seg><seg type="columnLine">below. He killed his motor and swung the stick to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left. As his ailerons jerked into position, he side-slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and joined the Curtiss on its earthward journey. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mad Michelson thrust his head from the falling cockpit and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung his hand in a low, sweeping movement indicating</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was forced to land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They hit the shifting desert floor at precisely the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, the wheels plowing through the gritty sand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tail skids drawing a wavering line behind them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jerry jumped from the cockpit and approached the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane as Michelson crawled out from behind the stick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you got here," he drawled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THESE words were meaningless to Jerry who decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had had enough of mystery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the matter, Michelson?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other surveyed him coolly. His manner nettled Jerry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the idea?" he said angrily. "You break orders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You drag me out here. You signal to land and then yon</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me there's nothing the matter. Are you crazy ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen," said Mad Michelson. "You want to find the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black Killer. Don't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know where he is?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jerry's eyes lit up and his voice was eager.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Son," said Michelson, in a soft voice. "I've brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to his hideout. I wanted to see if you'd follow me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And now that you have, I'll let you in on it. We're close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Black Killer's hangar."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jerry mentally forgave Michelson the wild chase he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">led him. He extended his hand impulsively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Michelson," he said earnestly, "You're a brave man to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tackle the Black Killer alone. And I'm glad you let me in</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it. Where is he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Michelson ignored the hand with a queer light in his eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come with me," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jerry followed Mad Michelson across the desert for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred yards.

The burning, searing heat sucked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very strength from his body.

For there in front of him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forming a perfect tarmac, was an almost flat clearing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocks, in front of a huge, darkened recess in the stony</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. As his gaze gradually penetrated the shadows inside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw that it formed a gigantic, natural, doorless hangar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and within, like a vulture awaiting the advent of its prey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that notorious, c'bony-black monoplane I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JERRY looked excitedly at Michelson, who leaned against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crag unmoved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Michelson," he gasped, his pulse pounding. "We've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. How did you know?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Michelson smiled a hard, twisted smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We haven't got him yet," he said evenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll get him, the dirty killer," said Jerry determinedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Do you know where he is?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Michelson stared vacantly at a scampering coyote in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance, for a moment, in silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll take you to him," he said at last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jerry was a little baffled at the other's peculiar manner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but stifling a dozen questions that ran through his mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he walked at Mad Michelson's side to the cavern entrance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He peered into the comparatively cool depths of the cave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, where is he?" he asked impatiently. "Aren't we</seg><seg type="columnLine">going--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He broke off suddenly, as he turned around to face</seg><seg type="columnLine">Michelson, and found - himself confronted with the snub</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose of an unwavering automatic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's right here," said Michelson, and his voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">edged with hate. "Right here, waiting for the gallant, young</seg><seg type="columnLine">air hero to capture him. Who did you think the Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">Killer was? What flyer in these parts do you know, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">has enough courage and skill to do the things lie's done?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm the Black Killer," he almost scrcamcd, in a tone that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent an involuntary shudder down Jerry's spine. "I'm the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man that you swore you'd get for Conroy. I'm the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's going to finish you and get the passenger plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she comes through!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jerry's utter bewilderment must have shown on his face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was Michelson really mad, after all? It seemed likely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't quite believe me, eh," sneered the livid face</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the automatic. "All right. Look."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He raised his left hand and without looking, pointed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the north.

"Well, that's your pal, Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roy's ship--or what's left of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Michelson," Jerry said steadily, "you're either a fietid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hell or you're a madman. I hope for your sake it's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter. Put down that gun and come with me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mad Michelson threw back his head and laughed heartily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"So," he said, with a final chuckle. "You come out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get the Black Killer with words. You should have known</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lawson, it wouldn't be that easy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"What do you intend to do, Michelson?" Jerry asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Michelson glared at him with distended eyes, but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice was even enough. He seemed calm and collected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't ask me questions," he replied. "I give no warn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings. When you discover what I'm going to do to you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it'll be too late for you to do anything about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jerry considered this in silence for a moment before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Michelson, there's one question I'd like to ask you. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">did you crack up Conroy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mad Michelson chuckled again in derisive amusement</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For the same reason I cracked up the other two planes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">First I like money, second, I like a fight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at his wrist-watch and cursed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Enough of this. Come on. She'll be here in a moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Get over to your plane."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having no alternative, Jerry obeyed, mentally trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure out what the other's game was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hop in," said Michelson as they reached the plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jerry crawled behind the stick and adjusted the safety</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt as the other strapped a parachute across his back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Michelson, still gripping the gun, clambered into the rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">cockpit. Jerry felt the sun-warmed pistol muzzle pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly at the nape of his neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take off," said Mad Michclson in a low, excited voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a frightened bird, Jerry's D.

As</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie leveled off and stabilized his ailerons, Michelson seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">the controls in the rear-cockpit. Jerry turned his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioningly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An instant too late, he saw Michelson come to his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his hand upraised and his thin lips parted in a cruel</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile. Swiftly, but not swiftly enough, he attempted to duck</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head, as he saw the butt of the automatic hurtling</seg><seg type="columnLine">down upon him. He was vaguely conscious of a dull blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">then a vacant darkness rushed upon him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shock of the blow caused the sturdy D. H. to dip</seg><seg type="columnLine">her nose for a second but, grabbing the rear stick, Mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">Michelson straightened her out and. doubling over the course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sped back to Death Valley. He glanced at his watch again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cast a hurried look behind him. The big biplane was</seg><seg type="columnLine">due in about ten minutes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cheeking his flying speed and seeking even more altitude,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he locked the controls and gingerly crawled out upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">port wing. Gauging the ground over a mile beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he swung his legs into place, hung for a thrilling</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment then let go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For some seconds he fell like a plummet through space</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then, as he tugged at the cord, the pilot 'chute shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and dragged the big, tent-like parachute after it. Mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">Michelson floated gently down to his death-dealing, black</seg><seg type="columnLine">monoplane, while Jerry Lawson sat, unconscious, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cockpit of the speeding, uncontrolled D. H.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mad Michelson's scheme was both cunning and simple.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The unguided D. H. would undoubtedly, sooner or later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike a pocket which would start her on her downward</seg><seg type="columnLine">valedictory trip. From such an altitude she would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed to bits, her unconscious pilot with her. Michelson</seg><seg type="columnLine">would blame the Black Killer and explain his absence</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the scene by contending that he had landed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley to investigate the crash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'T'flE D. H. biplane whirred steadily overhead. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, she flew as straight and true as though an expert</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-man were handling her. A ground observer never</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have suspected that in her cockpit was huddled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">limp, still figure of an incapacitated pilot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Straight up to the north she winged her reckless way--■</seg><seg type="columnLine">when suddenly the inevitable happened Her nose ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a bump and jerked up. As she started upward at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous angle, the tricky upward air draft hit her fuse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lage, moving her ailerons and elevators. She gave a fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened jerk like a horse shying at the unknown. The momen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary hesitation permitted the weight of her engine to pull</seg><seg type="columnLine">her nose downward and, with the engine racing madly, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">started a devastating dive earthward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down she flashed like a rocket, gravity and motor con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiring to give her a speed that she never had attained</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. Ten thousand--eight thousand--seven thousand--</seg><seg type="columnLine">The altimeter went suddenly crazy.

The instrument board</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembled a string of mad, electric clocks. The tachometer</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone kept sane, indicating a steady R. P. M. of 16,000.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Below, there rose a green-topped, lone peak at the northern</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance to Dealh Valley. Like a lover keeping his tryst,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the D.

A terrific rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wind flung itself viciously into his face, almost turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head, but blowing a clear, fresh draft of consciousness</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his befuddled mind. For a second he stared, horror-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken, at the fast approaching mountain top. Then his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain raccd. Before his thoughts were transmitted to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">aching muscles, his flying instinct had moved his hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He released the locks. Back came the stick, jerked with</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the force of his strong young arms. Up went the ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vators. The ship groaned and creaked under the fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain. She seemed to hang for an eternal moment above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the emerald crag. His speed slackened and then, as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed she must crash to her doom, she flattened out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust her nose up and reluctantly tore her way skyward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE leveled out and flew through the refreshing air. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could think more clearly up here than down below. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought drove into his mind persistently. He must get</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mad Michelson before the latter got the other plane. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">banked, circled and headed back to the south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had traveled some half-dozen miles when he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big, passenger-pay-roll biplane leaping along from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastern horizon. It was too late to look for Michelson now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He must see that the other ship got dirough safely first.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He banked again and zoomed for more altitude. If Michel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son should attack, he--Jerry--must have height for the duel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At 20,000 feet he came out of the upward glide and sailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">along in the direction of the passenger ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She passed some 10,000 feet beneath him, unconscious of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his presence. He circled about and followed her, his flash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing eyes searching the sky for Michelson. A black speck</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the blue appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though itching for the battle, Jerry kept his head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his altitude. In all probability, Michelson had not yet seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The tactics of the monoplane would be to rise above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prey, then flash down over his tail, spitting a stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">of steel death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Holding the stick firmly and ready for any emergency,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jerry watched Michelson's ship stride into an advantageous</seg><seg type="columnLine">position in the clouds. He pulled the stick back slightly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As high as the black monoplane went, Jerry climbed still</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher. With his hand on his machine-gun, he neared his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling, waiting for Michelson to flatten out, preparatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">to swooping down on the unwitting biplane beneath them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the black ship threw her nose violently forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and came out of her zoom. In a trice, Jerry flung the stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, revolved the magazine of the Lewis and shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">down through space. Michelson, unconscious of the Neme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sis hovering above him dived also, aiming at the tail of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big, gray bird below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Davis, at the stick of the passenger plane, looked up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw them. Frantically he jerked at the controls and side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped down to temporary safety, die Black Killer in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bloody pursuit. From seven hundred feet above him, Jerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched Michelson pull back his cocking handle. Setting</seg><seg type="columnLine">his teeth, with a swift thought of Conroy, Jerry was upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Pie came out of his dive in combat position over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Michelson's tail and, before the latter was aware of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence, he hurled a devastating barrage of machine-gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullets whistling through the black plane's struts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flying instinct alone saved the Black Killer. Even with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out completely comprehending the situation, he executed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect Immelniann, belching whining 303's through Jerry's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuselage as he passed. Jerry killed his engine, brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ailerons into play and dropped a sheer four thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. Michelson, his engine roaring a legato song of hate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dived after him. Jerry leveled out, flung the plane into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">zoom and squeezed the gun trigger, as for an instant his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sights bored the onrushing, murderous ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a second, Michelson sped past him, whipping a burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gleaming tracers into the side of the D. H. Jerry shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quick glance to his left, seeking the passenger plane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He noted that she was circling some four miles away, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though her pilot were considering the necessity of return-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to aid him. He had no time for further speculation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, for the black plane was again rising to the attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They circled for a moment like two fighters sparring for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an opening. Twice, Michelson fired a short burst that</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasted itself on the empty air. Jerry held his fire until an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity offered. Suddenly, as Michelson banked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared to circle once more, Jerry dashed for his tail, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the super-speedy monoplane with Mad Michelson at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick was too much for him. The black ship came up</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly on his exposed side and he diought he was done for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But this time luck was with him. Michelson's Lewis</seg><seg type="columnLine">barked twice and was silent, but not before one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slugs had eaten its way into Jerry's arm. Pulling franti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally at the controls, he awaited the final burst, but it never</seg><seg type="columnLine">came. Looking upward, he saw Mad Michelson, his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">distorted with rage, detach the empty magazine from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">post and hurl it violently earthward. As the mad killer</seg><seg type="columnLine">fumbled beneath his seat for more ammunition, Jerry shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">up once again; this time more successfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For fully five seconds he was in position over die other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail. Round after round followed each other up the burn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing barrel of the Lewis. Michelson dropped 3,000 feet, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jerry stuck in the dominating spot. Michelson wildly at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted to swing out from under, but stunt as he did,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jerry remained on his tail, unleashing his hurtling couriers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of doom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">npIIEN there came from the black ship a silver liquid</seg><seg type="columnLine">spray and Jerry knew it was over. The gas tank had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been hit. Mad Michelson's engine conked badly. The killer</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up at Jerry, with a peculiar, resigned smile upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. His hand was off his gun and Jerry held his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire awaiting the other's crash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Mad Michelson, waving his arm jauntily from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cockpit, thrust his stick forward and shot toward the yawn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing canyon below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Black Killer, not waiting for the death he had so</seg><seg type="columnLine">often dealt to others, shot down to meet it, with engine</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring and his prop blades singing a swati-song in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                  A Daughter** of Daring Swoops from the?

She nodded and drew down into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin, closing the window against the wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy circled over her and together they headed into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north. He left his window open that he might stare down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch her careening ship as it bit into the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each shock of the erratic wind caused Jimmy twofold</seg><seg type="columnLine">anguish, as he stared down at the plane beneath him with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">precious burden. A thrill of pride surged in him as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched her, aware that she was flying with a skill that</seg><seg type="columnLine">equalled his own and a daring that surpassed his because she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was desperately afraid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could no longer bear to fly above her, fearful that her</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane might buckle, yet he knew that he would be helpless in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that event at any level. Nevertheless, he went down and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew onward, almost wing to wing, with a scant distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">separating them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Linda waved and he saw her lips part in a reckless laugh, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesture of bravado. He thrust his head out into the gale,</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioning her with his eyes, straining his ears to listen for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drone of her engine. Was all well with her instruments?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was there ample fuel in the tank and were the controls re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponding as they should? These and a hundred other ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions he asked in his glance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TTER reply was a quick touch on the stick and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fokker dipped, then rose in signal. Jimmy was unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hear her engine, but he watched the blue flame as it spat</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceaselessly from the exhaust and marked that it struck as even-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly as his own. The motor then, was functioning properly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He studied the timber, searching for the trail. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem now, if Linda flew in safety to the lake, lay in making</seg><seg type="columnLine">a landing on the dangerously small surface of the ice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The feat would, he knew, tax her skill to the utmost. Failure</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a hundred feet would be more deadly than at five thousand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for she would have no time in which to right the plane if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped. Then too, his swift reasoning warned him, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be Larsen and his crew to contend with.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unquestionably they had heard Linda's plane take off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy sought to picture to himself the manner of her escape.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Farrell was out of it altogether, otherwise he would never</seg><seg type="columnLine">have permitted her to take his plane. The Provincials would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be outnumbered by the men in the sheltering timber and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond a doubt, Larsen would be ready with his long range</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifles, when two ships circled over the scene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''They'll pick us off," he muttered. "Damn them! They</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't have her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dipped in signal and drew her attention. Again leaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, leaving the controls free, he waved in a sweeping gesture</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her, trying to make her understand his meaning. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed up and made circles with his hand, while she stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him across the space that separated them. Next, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached to the floor of the cabin and seized a rifle, aiming it</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She nodded vigorously, still watching him. Jimmy lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barrel of the Marlin gun, bracingit against the wall of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin. Again she nodded and he signaled for her to climb,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he himself pointed down. Linda appeared to under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand and lie saw her reach for the stick. In the next moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">her plane commenced to climb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When, at length, they came over the clearing where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabins huddled unprotected, Jimmy flew at a scant five hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet, watching for moving figures below. Linda was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet above him, holding her speed to his own, hover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing like some great bird above its fighting mate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They circled over the clearing once, before Jimmy saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">puff of white smoke burst from the main cabin. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed instantly by another and answering puffs appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the skirts of the timber toward the lake. He swung the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward window open and thrust the Marlin gun outward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its heavy butt resting on the ledge. It was a clumsy</seg><seg type="columnLine">procedure, yet lie knew that the steel-jacketed bullets would</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel farther and be more effective than any slug from rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">or revolver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found himself longing for the old Spad, with the gun</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">firing through the propeller field in a vertical dive. A sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst from above the trees, a swift straight climb at a thous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feet in fifty seconds--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''I could get them then!" he said, sighting the Marlin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">throwing his weight on the butt to hold it down; then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed the trigger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hundred feet above the timber, Jimmy fired. He saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first burst of steel plough up the snow and caught a fleeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of men running back. As the plane swung upward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy turned his gaze to the circling ship that lingered above</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He heard nothing save the straining roar of his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On an abrupt bank he returned and dived again, firing as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees rose up over the nose of his plane. For those few</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds the controls were free and the ship was plunging with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out guidance. Jimmy sprang back and straightened her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he watched the scene below. They were firing at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, three of them who ran from the trees as he started up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw a hole appear magically in one wing and grinned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were getting the technique of it now, he reasoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly. They waited until he flattened off to climb, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out from shelter to get him when lie could not fire back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ever watchful of the plane above, he swung around now in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to see the ship move off in a direct line toward the lake</seg><seg type="columnLine">two miles distant. Jimmy hit the gun and went after her, cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cling as she came down. He saw the ailerons of her plane wiggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">in signal. Staring down toward the lake he sighted three</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures that emerged from the trees and waved, then ran back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to disappear as shots puffed out frpm the timber behind them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy grasped the significance of this and waved to Linda</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she brought her plane close. Farrell and the two Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vincials were fighting from the woods near where they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed. Larsen, then, had divided his men, sending some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to attack the cabin while the others remained to kill or</seg><seg type="columnLine">capture the wounded pilot and his aides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How then, Jimmy asked himself, did Linda manage to cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open sweep of the lake and reach Farrell's plane? He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered too, if Jerry and Davies could hold out much</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer at the cabin. They could expect little aid from Collins,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he considered. Indeed, it was likely that the weak-spined</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretary would secretly hinder them if he could.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy leaned from his cabin again and pointed up, urging</seg><seg type="columnLine">Linda to a higher ceiling out of rifle range. He saw now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his most important task was to drive the renegades from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiding-place beside the lake. Thus, he would be able to pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tect Farrell and the Provincials and, at the same time, create</seg><seg type="columnLine">a landing place for Linda. Later he could renew his attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the men who besieged the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accordingly, adjusting the Marlin again, he pointed down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">first assuring himself that Linda had understood his signal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her plane was up a thousand feet and climbing. Jimmy hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun and dived. He waited until he was almost over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, so that he could peer down between them. Then, aa</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man sprang across an open space, Jimmy pressed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trigger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HTHE Marlin spat its steel messengers in a staccato burst of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> death. The runner below staggered before he got into shel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, then plunged. His arms were flung awkwardly forward as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went down and lay quiet. Jimmy laughed and pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trigger again, then leaped back to the controls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a moment of strange significance, a pause, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the whole world hung motionless in its orbit. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine abruptly slowed, then burst into song again, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">brokenly, coughing. The plane tipped over crazily on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">wing and started into a slip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy's terse exclamation was synchronized with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift gesture, as he took die controls, toying widi the switch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The engine picked up, then quit. From its action, he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the gas feed was out of commission. A bullet had ripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the tank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Desperately, Jimmy struggled to climb. If he could gain a</seg><seg type="columnLine">decent altitude, his instinct told him, he would be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sleet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">55</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">switch off and come down to a landing on the ice. They would</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelt him with lead, of course. Still, he would have the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">for protection. And there was the Marlin, with half a drum</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ammunition, two rifles and his automatics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They may get me," he told himself, grimly, "but they'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">go through hell doing it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The plane was climbing, slowly, uncertainly, in imminent</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger of a tail spin. Looking up over the nose, Jimmy saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Linda's ship circle anxiously, then point down. She came</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her engine on full, in a long steep dive. When it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that her ship would ram him, she straightened and glided in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a circle, banking over sharply on one wing. She had opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">her window and was staring down at his careening Fokker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waved, motioning to her to climb back out of range.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While his hand still hung out in the wind, he felt the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">slip and the engine die. He dropped low in the office, fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the controls in a last effort to save himself. Strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, he experienced anger more than fear, anger at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruel irony that had almost let him win and now was taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the victory from him with so ruthless a hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rFHE plane was out of control. The rudder bar jammed and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> his efforts to loosen it were futile. The wind shrieked</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely in his ears, with the drone of the engine stilled. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of his chances with a 'chute, had he possessed one, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned, picturing himself dangling in the air, while the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">below picked him off at leisure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It'll be quick, this way," he thought bitterly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Linda would see him crack up. The game was ended. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, would have to come down, even if her nerves did not fail</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and send her down out of control. Larsen had won. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane turned over slowly, like an autumn leaf in the wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Staring out at the revolving universe, Jimmy saw Linda's</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane almost beside him. She was leaning far out from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin, signaling to him. Her hand pointed to the under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">carriage of her plane. Suddenly the dizziness left his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He sprang to his window and climbed out, clinging to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wires.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Linda was trying to save him!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy hung on to a strut with one hand and signaled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding of her plan. Then, swiftly, his face drawn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard, he crawled out on the upper wing. As his weight went</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the plane gradually straightened. The trees seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be coming up at a terrific speed, yet Jimmy calculated that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had twenjty scconds, perhaps thirty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For an instant it seemed inevitable that the two careening</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships would tangle. She was coming down, straight at him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the exact moment she swung up. The undercarriage</seg><seg type="columnLine">zoomed just over his head. Jimmy sprang for it, both arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended. In that dazzling instant he hung in space, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween earth and sky. Below lay certain death. Above was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lone chance of survival.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His hands gripped the cross bar. He was jerked into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air and his legs swung up. With a strength that came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperation, he pulled himself into the space between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">V-shaped bars of the carriage and hung on. Already, Linda</seg><seg type="columnLine">was climbing. He saw his plane plunge down and crash in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Until they had risen a thousand feet and were far out over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the timber, Jimmy gripped the rods, staring down dizzily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At length, sure of himself again, he crawled to the edge and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew himself up to the wing. Linda swung the door open and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fell into the cabin, numb from the cold, half conscious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as sudden realization struck him with its full significance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In danger, his nerves had functioned smoothly. Now, for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief moment, they faltered and Jimmy surrendered to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intoxication of relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pulled himself together and made his way forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the girl at the controls. His hand fell upon her</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. She looked up into his face and her eyes were wet</seg><seg type="columnLine">with tears, yet she smiled and spoke. He read her lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good stuff, Jimmy Blair."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He bent and spoke into her ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good girl, Linda Davies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They laughed oddly. He motioned for her to quit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot's seat and she surrendered the controls to hiirt. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned down to the switch and his hand gripped the stick as</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind took a new hold upon the will-o'-the-wisp of hope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy circled back over the timber, flying high now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">risking no chance shot from the ambushed marauders below.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was reduced to a single weapon, the automatic which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was strapped to his leg. The rifles, the Marlin, even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second revolver had, of course, gone down with the doomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Linda saw him look at his automatic and read his thoughts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She leaned down in the cabin and from beneath the low seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew a rifle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good!" he exclaimed. "That's what we need!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She could not hear the words, but she understood them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smiled. She leaned close and called into his ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get over them, Jimmy. I'll take the controls. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the rifle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He refused instantly, shaking his head in disapproval.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're too good with their guns," he called back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We've got to fly back over the trail. Sioux Lookout sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">men up. They're somewhere on the way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were over the lake again, a safe two thousand feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloft. Jimmy looked down toward the spot where he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">last seen the marksmen. Linda's gaze followed his and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclamation left her lips. There were three men running</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the ice. One of them lingered behind the others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half dragging himself. Puffs of snioke from the woods told</seg><seg type="columnLine">of riflemen in shelter who had them at their mercy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy pointed down, risking a shot to get a closer view.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Linda's hand tugged at his sleeve and she was suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking into his ear, her voice breaking with her emotion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jimmy," she cried, "they've got them on the run. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">man--that last one--is Fred Braddock. His hat--you re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded abruptly and reached for the stick. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember Braddock's peculiar headgear, a high cap of beaver</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin, that distinguished him from the others with their parka</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoods. The running men paused to fire back into the timber,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then started ahead. As the plane pointed down, they suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised their rifles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy turned in a steep bank, evading their fire. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the timber there now emerged two figures, shooting, as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran, at the men on the ice. Braddock went down. Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw his rifle flung out from him as he sprawled. Swiftly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene became clear to him and he prepared to go down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rearmost men were Provincials. He made certain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that as the plane circled low. He half turned and signaled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Linda.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going down," he shouted. "Lie down!--keep out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHE understood him and promptly obeyed. Jimmy head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed the plane down in a steep dive and laughed madly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The runners below paused, looked back at the timber and</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to keep on. The fire from the trees was kicking up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snow in little spurts about their feet. Their safety lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead in the dense growth across the ice. They left, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen companion and lurched ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the skis touched the ice, Jimmy wheeled the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">around and hit the gun. The engine roared and the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">sped across the ice, straight upon the fleeing men. Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">scooped up the rifle and without waiting to rip the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, fired through the glass. He pressed the trigger again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw one of them slacken his pace and stagger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The plane slid to a halt and Jimmy sprang down, shooting</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he ran. The men ahead abruptly wheeled and threw their</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifles down, lifting their hands high above their heads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep 'em up," Jimmy barked. "Way up, too, damn you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No shoot, Meestair poleece. We give up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stared into the shifty eyes of the lean Pierre. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">second man, white-faced, bleeding from a wound, he recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized as one of the Larsen outlaws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's Larsen?" Jimmy demanded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">56</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Flying Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pierre gestured toward the timber in the direction of camp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All right. Step ahead of me. We're going in after him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If he shoots, boys, he gets you first."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Provincials came running up, with Linda shielded</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind them. Jimmy recognized MacBrair and Clancy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, Blair. Dusty's back in the woods--hit. He said</seg><seg type="columnLine">it'd be you when we heard your plane." MacBrair greeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They regarded Jimmy's prisoners swiftly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll shove on back to camp," MacBrair resumed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You watch these fellows and look out for Miss Davies--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Arc Rogers and Silton back there?" Jimmy interrupted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They returned his gaze blankly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. They haven't showed up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy nodded and his eyes were worried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll all go in," he announced.

Psychological. Great flyers are born, not made.

"Air pocket" is merely a slang expression indicating</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">air currents which tend to go in a downward direction. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">action of the so called air pocket is to force the plane into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a sudden drop. All deviations of normal air currents are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">made by varying temperatures of the air. Such things as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cold water, shady spots, such as woods, etc., cause air to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">descend. These irregularities in air currents are found at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all heights up to 8,000 or 10,000 feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">2.	So called bumps in the air are caused by erratic mo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion of air currents, such as warm and cold air coming to-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gether, cross wind currents meeting, passing over rivers,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deep gorges, cities or any spots where air currents tend to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be irregular because of varying atmospheric conditions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">3.	The quickest way to bring a machine out of a spin is to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">centralize the rudder and push the control stick forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">This action will bring the plane out into a straight dive,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when the control stick is pulled back until level flight is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">again obtained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">4.	According to Department of Commerce regulations, a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plane is supposed to maintain a height of 500 feet or more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when in cross-country flight; 1,000 feet over a city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">5.	A plane should always land and take off against the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wind. This is done both for safety and to obtain the greatest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">measure of lift from the air currents when taking off and to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">obtain the greatest amount of break power or speed reduction</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when landing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">6.	You may identify licensed aircraft from unlicensed air-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">craft in the following manner.

According to Air Commerce Regulations (Article 10),</seg><seg type="columnLine">the manufacturer of a motor is required to give that motor a</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-five hour running test and present to the Department</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Commerce a log of this run.

The average life of an airplane engine is 300 hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a major overhauling.

A Curtiss OX5 motor uses about eight gallons of gas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oline to every sixty miles which should indicate that it aver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages around eight miles to a gallon.

The effect of a supercharger on an engine is to pump</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a greater or heavier charge of mixture so that the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression will be the same at sea level as it is at great heights</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite the reduced air density.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 11.

S. I'U be waiting for your answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dear Rudy:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In answer to your first question as to how many horse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">power is required to raise 2250 pounds to a height of 5,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in five minutes, we must first consider what a horse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">power is. One horsepower is the amount of energy exerted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to raise a weight of 33,000 pounds one foot in one minute, or,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at it the other way around, one horsepower will raise</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty-three pounds 1,000 feet in one minute. Now as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">how many horsepower is required to raise 2250 pounds 1,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in one minute, you must divide 2250 by 33 which will</seg><seg type="columnLine">give you 68-2/11 horsepower required to raise 2250 pounds</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1,000	feet in one minute, and of course you realize that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be the same amount expended to raise it 5,000 feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">five minutes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In answer to your second question, the Hispano-Suiza</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor A is the 150 horsepower motor. It is water-cooled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The only difference between the Curtis VI550 and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Supercharged V1550 is that the latter is equipped with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">supercharger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cabane is a framework for supporting the wings at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuselage and is also applied to the system of trussing used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to support overhang in the wing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As to your next question, a 360° turn is a horizontal turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the form of a complete circle which leaves the airplane</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying in the same direction as before it made the turn, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, a 180° turn is just half of that and leaves the air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane flying in the opposite direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would be impossible for us to advise you about taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">an Army or Navy training. Either is excellent. A course</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken before joining the Army or Navy would be of little</seg><seg type="columnLine">use inasmuch as you get the finest aviation training known</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you become a- cadet in the Flying Corps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We know of no special subjects that would be of benefit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you in relation to a flying school in either the Army or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Navy, but to join as a cadet in either of these services, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have had two years of college work or pass an exami-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation which is the equivalent thereof. (Read requirements</seg><seg type="columnLine">above.)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As to why many aviators do not think that Allen's plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its aspect ratio of 17 would fly, we imagine it is be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of the great amount of resistance that would be due in</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a ratio. Resistance increases as the aspect ratio be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes greater.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I will try to find a pilot who has the time to correspond</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you and will send you his address at my earliest op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portunity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thank you for your letter, Rudy.

Inasmuch</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you are asking my advice on this matter, I am going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell you exactly what I should do if I were seventeen</seg><seg type="columnLine">today and know what I know now. I have had many</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of experience in aviation, both in the War and since</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, and I realize only too well what an expert training</seg><seg type="columnLine">means in this field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  If I were seventeen, as your are, I would certainly go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to college where, upon my graduation, I would enter an</seg><seg type="columnLine">aviation school, in which I could obtain a thorough and</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhaustive knowledge of aviation. I take it from your</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter that such a procedure would be possible in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">case, but if you found, for financial or any other reasons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you could not complete your college course, 1 would at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least take two years, which would entitle you to apply to</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Adjutant-General, U. S. Army, at Washington, D. C.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an appointment as a flying cadet. There your training</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be free of charge and you would go to a school</seg><seg type="columnLine">conducted by the United States Government where it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take you one year to complete a thorough and splendid</seg><seg type="columnLine">aviation education. With such a background, the future</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any normal boy is assured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  If on the other hand, your finances are unlimited, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">could obtain the same education through any one of a number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of schools in the United States inasmuch as this country</seg><seg type="columnLine">boasts of the best equipped schools in the world today.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Please understand that I am not belittling home study</seg><seg type="columnLine">courses in the United States, but it appears to me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they serve their purpose by fitting men who are unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">cither because of age or financial ability to do that which</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Education is the first stepping stone to accomplishment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and especially so when your vocation is a profession, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you must remember that aviation has entered that field.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By all means, go to college and then if the unusual should</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen and you should change your mind and decide upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">another vocation you would have a foundation that nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">could replace. If in two years' or four years' time, I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">look back and see you have accomplished this and feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in some measure we were responsible, it would make</seg><seg type="columnLine">me most proud. If, as you say, your uncle is flying now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am sure if you showed him this letter, he would say</seg><seg type="columnLine">this is sound advice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  You can get training in less time than in the way I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested, but you are young and have plenty of time, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am suggesting a way that will give you that little extra</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch which will place you above the others in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">field of endeavor. Whether you accept this advice or not,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I wish you all the luck in the world and would appreciate</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing from you as to what you have decided to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  If there is anything more that I can do for you in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">way whatever in this line, do not hesitate to write me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Very truly yours,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Macfadden Aviation Advisory Board</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Gentlemen:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Will you please inform me:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  1.

To Lenore its disappearance was a sign; they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">irrevocably committed to this wild venture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While Cross groped feverishly in the cockpit and finally</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">69</seg><seg type="columnLine">70</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Flying Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">found the switch and a miraculous little button that il-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumined the instrument board, Lenore, with eyes almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinded by the downpour, followed the streak of red flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was fading, vanishing in the black, rain-swept eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. An .1 as she watched it died away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The starter screamed; the propeller moved reluctantly, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">little jerks. Round and round it went, without a cough</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the motor. Then, at the moment of despair, came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst of sound, a belch of fire from the exhaust that sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lenore's head ducking into the cockpit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The motor thundered into its stupendous cacophony and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind tore with tripled energy at the girl's helmet, as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously, peered above the padded rim of the cockpit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The seaplane took up the slack of its mooring in a nerv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous plunge ahead. For a few seconds Cross gave her the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun, shooting gas to the limit into her hungry cylinders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was now no dissonance in that stupendous symphony</seg><seg type="columnLine">of power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Throttling down, he slipped out of the forward cockpit</seg><seg type="columnLine">onto one of the pontoons, cast loose the mooring and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambled back to his seat. The mad wind seized die light</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft in its invisible, buffeting arms and thrust it backward</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the bay into a region where pelting rain and Cim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">merian night cut off the rest of the world like a dripping,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sable curtain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CROSS let her drift a few seconds. He hastily examined</seg><seg type="columnLine">the instrument board. Then he methodically moved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick backward and forward to work the elevators, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">from right to left, to operate the ailerons at the wing tips.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The stick felt right and so did the rudder bar which his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet controlled. His hand went to the throttle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The seaplane lunged forward, like a thoroughbred under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whip the pontoons cleft the water and the whole light</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure of the plane shuddered under the rack of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">racing motor. But faster and faster the ship gallantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stormed ahead, bouncing more lightly now over the heaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the bay. It was a matter of moments before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clenched right hand of Cross, fixed on the little stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">that governed life and death, brought his plane off the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a breath more she hung level, then rose sharply over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deeper darkness that crept below. The right wing went up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a lurch and the plane veered around to the eastward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once more Lenore ventured to raise her head. Rain-drops,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard as hail at this high speed, rattled against her helmet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and goggles and set her cheeks on fire. The plane was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer charging directly into the gale but the sheets of rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed nevertheless to assail her from ahead, sweeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizontally through the propeller and under the upper wing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A flame, fierce and fiery as the breath of a dragon, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaping from the right side of the motor roaring backward</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the linen-sheathed side of the fuselage, and flaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">astern. Instinct warned that the hungry blaze would con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sume plane and passengers; reason tremulously denied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger. Real reassurance came to Lenore when she drew in</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the gale and stared forward through the tiny, stream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing glass of the windshield.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She could see the head of Cross, motionless, fixed, pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">truding from the other cockpit He was staring into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chaotic gloom in front, through the propeller sweep, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather side of the plane, opposite the blinding flare of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor exhaust Seemingly he paid no attention to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame, to the biting rain, or to the controls within the cock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit His whole being seemed concentrated on the task of</seg><seg type="columnLine">locating some faint glimmer of red ahead of them that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicate the whereabouts of the flying boat in which Louis</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gregg was speeding on some baneful mission.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lenore reluctantly released the clutch her hands had main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained on the seat since the take-off. Shielding her cheeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her palms, she leaned out into the lashing wind and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with eyes narrowed behind her goggles, searched the space</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above, below and directly forward, there seemingly was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing--not land, nor sky, nor water. Only the plane and</seg><seg type="columnLine">an aura of red-glowing mist and rain surrounding it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">real. More fear-inspiring than the flame itself, was this</seg><seg type="columnLine">mantle of scarlet enveloping the plane. Beyond was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even blackness. The earth was not. All creation might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have vanished, leaving this roaring mote alone in unten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anted space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lenore shuddered, and turned her thoughts to Coralie, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gregg, to material things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sudden lurch threw her against the left side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cockpit. For the first time she became conscious that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was physically as well as mentally uneasy and strained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That clutch of hands on seat had been part of it. She now</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized the reason. The light seaplane was plunging and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling in sharper, quicker motions than a small boat in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough sea; it was swiftly parting a way through an ocean</seg><seg type="columnLine">of air currents gone mad. That tension and swelling about</seg><seg type="columnLine">her heart was due to her apprehension of this farrago of</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements, this dance of discord which must be resisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the slender, outstretched wings, the tiny wires and struts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woven threads of linen cloth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was impossible to anticipate, to compensate for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy action of the plane. Now it rose slowly under her--</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ominous, breath-arresting lift that slowed the beating</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her heart--then completed the rise in a sudden leap and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next moment, dropped from under her, setting her heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounding frantically and her hands clutching at the cockpit's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides. Never could she prepare for what was coming. . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">She realized, with a little start, that she had been neglecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">her watch ahead. She peered out over the side again, stifling</seg><seg type="columnLine">a desire to scream for the sheer relief it would give her</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves from that unbearable uncertainty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gaze of Cross was set uncompromisingly ahead, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as she resumed her hopeless straining of eyes, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and looked at her. In the flare of the exhaust every</seg><seg type="columnLine">feature of one side of his face leaped into view. Lenore</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a little gasp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead of the stern, grey, tight-lipped countenance she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had unconsciously visualized as belonging to that man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fighting his way through the tempest, her eyes en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countered the smiling, broad-mouthed, reddened face of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheery young man very much on the alert for trouble but</seg><seg type="columnLine">nevertheless enjoying an escapade to the full. She felt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes were twinkling behind the shadowing goggles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was nothing in him of coldness, or reserve; nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of apprehension or strain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This new Cross flicked his disengaged left hand over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather side of the plane, like a man indicating a prized</seg><seg type="columnLine">possession. Simultaneously the plane reeled to the right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T ENORE'S heart jumped and her hands darted to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat as she tumbled suddenly against the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cockpit The plane instantly rolled back to the horizontal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying a frightened Lenore with it, but there remained in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes a dim vision of a blur of red light, ahead and far</seg><seg type="columnLine">below them, that had been revealed with that roll of the plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the face of Cross, still turned backward, revealed an</seg><seg type="columnLine">apologetic, solicitous expression. He motioned downward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ahead, in the direction in which Lenore had glimpsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that momentary flare, and his lips framed the word,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Gregg!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lenore nodded violently and her fears slipped away into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night, like wolves slinking from a blazing camp-fire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was nothing to worry about. This strange young man</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the forward cockpit was conquering the storm without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">qualm; he had discovered Gregg--perhaps had seen him</seg><seg type="columnLine">from almost the first--and he was so undisturbed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fury of the elements that he ventured to bank his unstable</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft far to one side merely that she might have a clear view</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the quarry. Lenore felt a momentary desire to shout to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him not to show her the other boat again; then she decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this was unnecessary. His expression had promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">emphatically that she should not be alarmed again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">High-Handed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">71</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As she sank into her seat, touching the back of it for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time, she experienced an overwhelming flood of curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">osity concerning this queer, cold quick-acting and daring</seg><seg type="columnLine">young individual in whose hands her life lay. Without</seg><seg type="columnLine">question she had agreed to fly with him through this terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm and blackness, in a plane about which she knew noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. And he had never even told her he was a pilot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">/"\F course, the need was urgent--Gregg must be pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vented from reaching Coralie at any cost--but who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was this young man to whom she had entrusted herself so</seg><seg type="columnLine">casually? She did not know even his name, and yet, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinctively, she had trusted him. The thought sent a thrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">through her, half of pleasure and half of fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The motor roared on, the exhaust flamed, the seaplane</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitched, as it held its unvarying place high in the wilderness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hissing rain and air, behind the heavier craft which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknowingly leading it directly to its unknown destination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">moved forward as the nose of the boat grounded. Gregg</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung them the anchor rope, barking nervous commands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he sprang ashore, directed the paying out of enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope to moor the boat in .deeper water and commanded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trio to make fast the line to an axle of the car. The wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still tearing at land and water in spasmodic fury, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rain had almost ceased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''That'll hold her," Gregg announced after an inspection</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mooring.

He glanced at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous hands on the dial of the clock set into the instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment board and the worried lines in his forehead deepened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Short, ugly words dripped from his protruding, down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned lower lip.

Ahead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a little to the right, two white lights, whose vertical</seg><seg type="columnLine">beams seemed to pierce th storm easily, burst into view.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Simultaneously they winked, out and on, three times, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">their glare was uninterrupted. After a moment or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">their beams were depressed, one at a time, so that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">played upon the uneasy water at the edge of a sandy shore.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gregg throttled down with a grunt of relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the land was to the weather side, the water had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been lashed to fury by the wind. With the aid of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights Gregg dived, banked and set his cumbersome boat on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water without difficulty. He taxied toward the beacons</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cut the motor just before reaching the gently sloping</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three men, who had been standing beside an automobile</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose powerful headlights had been the landing lights,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stare.

Gregg's eyes blazed.

"I'm doing the thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. Coralie Roweton! God, what luck!" He was mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering to himself, taking short strides up and down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach. "I've got her here--here--and we're still safe.

He stopped his flow of</seg><seg type="columnLine">words to stare at Gregg, who had swung about at Meigler's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nod toward the bungalow and now was dog-trotting up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meigler followed the pilot, but Hance paused to address</seg><seg type="columnLine">the silent third member of the trio, a huge man in a pea</seg><seg type="columnLine">jacket who half stood, half sat, against a mudguard of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car, with his powerful arms crossed on his chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder does the boss really believe that line about her</seg><seg type="columnLine">being one of the Roweton gals?" the little man speculated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Say, wouldn't that bull the game if she was?

All the careful alibi I've built</seg><seg type="columnLine">up is endangered, maybe ruined I How do you suppose I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can work anything safely now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meigler wilted, incoherently voicing explanations and apol-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ogies. Gregg shoved him aside with a curse and strode up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wooden steps to the bare porch of the ciapboarded, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">painted bungalow. He paused, struggling with his wrath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It'll take all the stuff I've got and the luck of!-- I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to get away with this or we're sunk I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No chatter of girlish voices impinged upon his ears. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead he entered a silence as thick as a thundercloud. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stuffy little room to the right, on either side of an oil</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamp sat two girls, each apparently under the impression that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was the sole occupant of the bungalow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One was a dark-haired, black-eyed young woman some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what spare of form and sharp of countenance, clad in sport</seg><seg type="columnLine">attire of the most pronounced cut and of no subdued color.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She sat stiffly in her chair and her hands were uneasily</seg><seg type="columnLine">active in her lap, but it was quite plain to Gregg after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single glance at her smoldering dark eyes that it was anger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not embarrassment, that dictated her attitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other girl, upon whom Gregg looked with suppressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiety, was Coralie Roweton. She had chosen a rocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair and flung herself into it with an easy grace that lin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered in her present attitude. She was quite obviously com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortable and cheerful. This was strange because she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad in a sweater that undoubtedly was the father of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweaters, the property of the laconic giant without, and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">attire was completed by a pair of wrinkled and far-gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">trousers that spread abroad the fact that they undoubtedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">once--and not so long since--had been intimately connected</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the fishing industry. Certainly few girls would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been happy in such a costume, yet Coralie was emphatically so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both girls looked up at the sound of the opening door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was Coralie who won the trick. In a flash she was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her feet. In another flash she had given Gregg both her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and the most entrancing smile in her ample stock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you are the Black Corsair, Louis," she trilled, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, with one of those swift, stabbing feminine glances to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward Pen Eldridge she chattered on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me, do! How much do you charge for abducting</seg><seg type="columnLine">a girl?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For just a moment the audacity and dash of her greeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbed Gregg of his usual glibness of tongue. But it was less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a moment before Pen Eldridge flew out of her chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and confronted the pilot:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Louis, are you going to let this--this creaturc--say</seg><seg type="columnLine">tilings like that right to my face?" Her lips worked con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulsively and she shot venomous eyes from the gay Coralie</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to Gregg. "If you don't send her away from here this</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant-" Her voice shrilled to incoherency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'"VES, yes, of course, dear," Louis Gregg murmured</seg><seg type="columnLine">-*■ soothingly and laid a hand reassuringly, though some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what gingerly upon Pen's arm. ''I'm afraid you're a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">upset by this storm and my unavoidable absence, but I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">back safe now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am not upset," shrieked Pen Eldridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, not precisely upset," he agreed hastily, "but just a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little bit anxious, dear ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl had taken refuge in a handkerchief and her reply</seg><seg type="columnLine">was inaudible. Gregg patted her back, mumbling sympathy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and contrived to shoot a smile at Coralie, over Pen's bowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Coralie, I see you've discovered my little secret,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said amiably.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pen's head came up with a jerk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't speak to her," she shrilled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come now, dear, I must be polite to her, you know,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louis Gregg gently remonstrated. "She's our guest; you</seg><seg type="columnLine">mustn't forget that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dark eyes of Miss Eldridge shot sparks. "And when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you get through talking with--with this castaway perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">you may want to talk to me. But I'm sorry to say that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you won't be able to, because after waiting up all night and</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffering agonies of torture and torment for you through</seg><seg type="columnLine">High-Handed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">73</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the storm, I'm going to bed. I'm completely exhausted!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She whirled around, evading Gregg's protesting hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swept, with head high, through a door leading to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear of the bungalow. The door banged shut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The instinctive movement of restraint that the pilot had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made, changed, with the shutting of the door, to a gesture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">indifference. Before Coralie had removed her interested</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes from Pen's dramatic exit, Gregg's attention was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrated most flatteringly on her, the girl in the hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say, look here, Mr. Gregg," Coralie burst out in unem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrassed amazement, "do you mean to tell me you fell in</seg><seg type="columnLine">love with her and had to kidnap her to make her love you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The frankness of this seemed to hit Louis Gregg squarely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he blinked as if hit. When he spoke, it was with a philo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sophical gentleness of tone that would preclude the possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility of his voice carrying through that closed door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Love is a strange thing, Coralie, a strange thing," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said and there was melancholy, in addition to philosophy, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his moving voice. "It is true that very recently I was madly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in love with that girl."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you aren't now?" Coralie asked promptly and, indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"LTIS eyes, backed by an inscrutable face, searched hers</seg><seg type="columnLine">intensely, then flicked away. He did not speak as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">led her gendy to her rocking-chair. For a moment he stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensely before her, his face flooded with anguish. He passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a weary hand through his hair, tousling the long locks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Coralie, she doesn't understand me," he intoned hollowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and collapsed into a chair. With elbows on knees, chin</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting on his hands, he stared mournfully at the bare wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">of die room. "She loves me, but it is the surface me, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot, the--the good-looking young man that she sees when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she looks at me. But she does not understand the real me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my depths, my soul."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His fixed, agonized gaze was broken by a swift glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the girl. She was watching him, her eyes big with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong emotion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"She does not understand you--the real you," she breathed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's it exactly," Gregg agreed. "Sometimes, Coralie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have hoped--yes, even diought that you, although I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen little of you, have penetrated to depths of understand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of me that she will never reach."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Coralie blinked. "You--you think I understand you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she asked softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he declared firmly and turned to lay his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly on her shoulders. His handsome eyes searched hers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It may be audacious of me, even impudent of me, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think you do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Coralie faced him without the slightest movement of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponse or of protest at his sudden caress. Then slowly she</seg><seg type="columnLine">averted her head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--I do understand you, Louis Gregg, I do," she whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His dark eyes blazed with triumph and, in his moment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">exultation, they did not note that Coralie's own eyes, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cealed beneath her long lashes darted a keen, unmaidenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance upward at his flushed face. His arms moved toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, but at that moment Coralie leaned backward a trifle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly he abandoned his purpose and drew back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But tell me, Louis, did you really just haul her out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water and carry her off despite her struggles?" Coralie</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Louis Gregg smiled. From a pocket of his leather coat</seg><seg type="columnLine">he withdrew a letter. "This is a secret, Coralie, but I'm going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to let you in on it," he murmured, with a cautious eye on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door through which Pen Eldridge had vanished. "I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">here a letter written by Pen--quite voluntarily, you know--</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her father, in which she states that she was expecting me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to land for her at Southampton and that was why she swam</seg><seg type="columnLine">out so far."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Really?" said Coralie, gazing with frank interest at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">envelope. 'That would come in handy if the county police</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">or whatever they are got hold of you, wouldn't it? Lucky</seg><seg type="columnLine">you haven't had time to mail it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For just a moment, a frown formed on Gregg's brow. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at diis naive young girl with a shade of doubt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perplexity in his expression, but her clear young eyes, alight</seg><seg type="columnLine">with admiration, dwelt upon his unwinkingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*****</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The instant that Gregg throttled his motor and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">maneuvering for a landing was one of immediate action for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cross.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The red will-o'-the-wisp that was leading the two pursuers</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their lurching plane through the wilderness of damp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">black, intangibility was square in Cross' line of vision,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when its glare flickered and faded away. Like the dart of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snake, the tall pilot's hand leaped to his own ignition switch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To Lenore, tense in the rear cockpit, came stunning, anni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hilating silence and darkness. Her universe--a thing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaking flame and rhythmic thunder--was instantly blotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. For a moment, stupefying, absolute blankness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence, incomprehensible, utterly terrifying, prevailed. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as die girl's heart plunged wildly in her breast, there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a feeling of sinking and a gradually rising wail of demoniac</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumph rioted in her ears, shrilling through her head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A voice, as welcome to her as air to the lungs of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowning, came back through the darkness. It shouted above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the devilish screaming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's landing. I cut to prevent them from spotting us</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the flare of our exhaust."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "W-what is that ?" Lenore quavered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A laugh, a real, casual laugh, soothed her. "That noise?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just the taut wires between the wings singing us a tune.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sound spooky?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dreadful. Can't diey hear it down there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a chance. We're too far away. And, as long as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you hear it, you know we're in a safe glide."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It didn't sound like a safe glide. Cross spoke no more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and somehow Lenore sensed a certain tensity, an increas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing vigilance in him, although she could barely make out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loom of his head and shoulders. The plane whistled</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward, with little lifts and drops that affected her like</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief electric shocks. Staring straight ahead, past Cross'</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure and through the slowly rotating propeller, Lenore</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaguely perceived a thickening of the gloom that indicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">land--or water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were very close--how close she could not judge--</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Cross suddenly banked the plane sharply to the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and headed directly into the faint greyness that lightened a</seg><seg type="columnLine">segment of the horizon. They struck something with a jolt</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Lenore felt the plane leap upward again like a startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse. She saw Cross lunge suddenly forward in the cockpit</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the plane, as if in response, nosed down, leveled off and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jounced easily over the water. Ahead Lenore could see a</seg><seg type="columnLine">darker line of blackness that must be the shadow of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dunes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ROSS' breath whistled outward through his mouth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Rotten landing," he muttered, his voice depreca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory, but Lenore was not deceived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You didn't think you could do it at all in this dim light,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she accused. He turned and peered at her, heedless of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane, which was already drifting away from the dimly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensed shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "H'm," he remarked, his surprise manifest. "That's pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">good mind-reading. I did think we might have a bit of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next instant he was scrambling down onto the pon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toons, with the plane's patent anchor in his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have to warp her in," he explained. "We could swim</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it but I don't want to desert our only line of retreat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We might need it if, for instance; Gregg's got Coralie in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip already."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Progress was slow, for the plane drifted backward each</seg><seg type="columnLine">74</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Flying Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">time Cross pulled up the anchor for another heave toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore. He worked manfully, with perspiration dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his forehead Lenore discovered that she was shiver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and cramped in her cockpit, but she did not offer any</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistance she knew could be rated by a busy man only as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawback.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unremitting effort finally brought the seaplane to shal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good! Only three feet deep," Cross cxclaimed, much</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratified and splashed overboard. With the end of the rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">slung over his shoulder, he toiled ahead through the shallows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the plane grounded he dug the anchor into the beach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on," lie called, and Lenore climbed slowly out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cockpit, her tingling feet feeling their way. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">she found herself in the pilot's arms. He swashed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water and set her upon her feet on the firm sand, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a matter-of-fact thump.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, here we are, wherever here is," he remarked, peer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing this way and that through die gloom. Around them was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing but mist and sand. The noise of cresting waves still</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapping angrily at the dying breeze filled their ears, unchal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenged by other sound. The grey in the east was now reach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out over the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"rT'HE outlook's a bit bleak, but we have the edge on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gregg, anyhow," Cross commented cheerfully, after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">close stare at the rather drooping, damp figure that stood be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side him. "We don't know where we are, but we know where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gregg is. And he thinks we're back in Southampton."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do hope we can prevent him from reaching Coralie,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lenore said, clenching her teeth to prevent their chattering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If we could only find her 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He landed about half a mile or so down the beach, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">near as I could judge, from the air," Cross said thoughfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We'll have to move cautiously for we haven't the least idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what kind of game we're playing. We may run into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">den of cutthroats or even a practical joke. All we know is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had somebody on the watch for him on the ground."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked at the girl compassionately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know you're dripping wet, but we can't risk a fire now."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He spoke soothingly, as if to a child. The disconsolate</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure straightened and he felt her eyes upon his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you think I'm downhearted you're mistaken," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">retorted with brave indignation. "It--it feels a little dryer</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I don't move much and that's why I slouched. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm ready to go after Gregg this minute."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He chuckled, immensely relieved. "Good! Come on 1"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he commanded and tucked her hand under his arm in</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly fashion. "We're off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sprang ahead at a dog-trot and Lenore ran lightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind, catching up in a few steps. Their feet spurned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet sand in unison as they jogged along and soon a warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow pulsed through her cramped body. The air became</seg><seg type="columnLine">crisp rather than piercing as they breathed it and the east-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern sky gave more promise of a sunlit day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their spirits rose with the coming sun and the quickening</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sluggish blood in their veins. They looked at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other and, without reason, laughed gaily. The beach un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeled with marvelous speed beneath them and the retreating</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows revealed a clean, fresh world, from which rt seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">all trace of man had been swept by the storm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The swish and thud of their feet on the firm, moist sand</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to be an unceasing, rhythmic refrain, as much a</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of life as the plash of the waves, when Cross finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to a reluctant halt. Ahead the shore made a slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn. Projecting dunes, sparsely covered with coarse grass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">barred the view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gregg's landing place can't be far beyond this point,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cross said, keeping his voice low. "Probably it is just</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the turn. Let's look around."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their gay abandon of the run along the shore changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to slow caution as they advanced to the shelving bulk of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dunes and peered around the curve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few hundred feet ahead they saw Gregg's big flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat, tailing out in the water, beyond a mooring rope. Well</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the high water line, a black touring-car stood motion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less. There was no one in sight, but above a bungalow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">set upon the dunes, a plume of black smoke, trailing toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water, indicated that people were up and about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a moment of scrutiny of the peaceful scene, Cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Lenore retreated a few steps and faced each other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If we only knew," Lenore murmured. Her face revealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her anxiety and Cross hastened to speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The whole gang is probably at breakfast," he said. "Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooks must eat. The question now arises: What do we do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lenore besought his answer with an appealing glance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he continued:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Plan No. 1. Watch and await their next move. Plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">No. 2.

He picked up a piece of driftwood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy from the months in the water, but stout as ever. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold a theory that all the desperation in that bungalow can</seg><seg type="columnLine">be cured with a bit of wood judiciously applied"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He halted an enthusiastic sweep of his club to add, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tinge of regret:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But somehow I'm depressed with the thought that Gregg</seg><seg type="columnLine">is playing a game into which force doesn't enter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How can you say that--if he is the Black Corsair,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lenore interposed doubtfully. "At least he forcibly kid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">naped Penelope Elridge."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cross shook his head dubiously. "I'm unable to back</seg><seg type="columnLine">up my theories with facts, but I feel I'm right," he insisted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've met some hellbenders at various times myself and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasn't that cut of jib.

"That proves he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">daring, even reckless."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cross laughed. "Ever since I first watched him handle a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane, I've felt he's no bold, bad man. Flying's no sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sporting spirit these days. It's as safe as motoring and</seg><seg type="columnLine">not so dusty. Lenore, he's a bit too ladylike in the way he</seg><seg type="columnLine">handles his ailerons."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lenore considered this technical criticism somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtfully and refrained from speech.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"T'M going to call on him now--taking this club to pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent misunderstandings," he announced.

"You must</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of Coralie, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But-" The girl's rebellious eyes dwelt upon another</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stick of driftwood on the beach, lighter than the man's but</seg><seg type="columnLine">substantial, nevertheless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In Cross' face a sudden, transforming light seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow for just an instant, as he followed the direction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes.

Then he stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If they jump us both, Coralie's out of luck," he reminded</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, his tone low, but insistent. "As a matter of fairness to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," the girl said reluctantly, "I suppose you're right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I knew you'd see it that way," he interrupted hastily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">High-Handed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">75</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his relief ill-suppressed.

The girl's eyes fluttered shut</seg><seg type="columnLine">as his arms loomed about her, but, with a reassuring pat</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the shoulder, he turned and walked around the point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swinging his driftwood club with careless ease, he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way down the beach. Lenore, taking cover in the grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the dunes, watched him with wide eyes, while her finger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nails dug tiny half-moons in the palms of her hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HPHAT interview with Coralie which had begun so prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">-*• isingly for Louis Gregg did not move along on die ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derly confidential lines planned by the handsome pilot</seg><seg type="columnLine">In fact, about the time diat Cross was sloshing his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward shore, with the seaplane towing jerkily behind him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coralie gave the little talk a decidedly novel twist</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evading die ardent arms of the suddenly love-struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black Corsair, she leaped to her feet like a startled tigress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I understand you, Louis Gregg! I understand you</seg><seg type="columnLine">right down into your inner being where you keep your</seg><seg type="columnLine">withered wits," she blazed, disdaining to retreat behind die</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. "You couldn't fool Lenore with your silly blather-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings on the yacht and you can't fool me, either."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For just a moment his poise deserted him. He stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring, amazed at the girl whom he had so underrated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At that instant, in her fearless, defiant indignation she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">superb, commanding; then girl-like, she realized what a</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendid figure she made and youthful self-consciousness</seg><seg type="columnLine">overwhelmed her. She-laughed scornfully, but there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hint of the theatrical in it. Louis Gregg recovered him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self; an air of indifference replaced his obvious surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You compliment yourself, Coralie," he said, smiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">indulgently. "Because I chose to amuse myself by thrilling</seg><seg type="columnLine">a silly child and talking twaddle you think you see through</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Well, you don't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was such a grim, cold menace in his voice as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarled the last few words that Coralie blenched. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden transformation was like storm clouds overwhelming</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm tired of talking to you," she said hurriedly. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes on his, she slipped around the rocking-chair and sidled</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the outer door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop!" shouted Gregg and sprang after her. Coralie'u</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasty walk became a run. She flung herself at the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as her hand seized the knob the panels between her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and freedom resounded in a sharp rat-a-tat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door swung inward. Coralie dodged and leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the opening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Grab her!" Gregg commanded. Outside on the porch</seg><seg type="columnLine">his three men, about to file in, fell back in confusion; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">little Iiance flung his arms about the fleeing girl and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other two closed in about them. They brought her back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put her in that closet," Gregg directed, indicating a door</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the other side of the cottage. "You--" his eyes picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the giant--"stand in front of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hance watched the order obeyed in silence, but as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the door closed on the sobbing girl he turned to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">superior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We been doing a little thinking outside, boss," he began,</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking slowly, as if picking his words carefully. "These</seg><seg type="columnLine">other guys have asked me to put it up to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean?" demanded Gregg, frostily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hance jerked his head sideways toward the closet door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, there's somepin. F'r instance, what do you expect</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do with diat goil? Keep her in the closet till she dies</seg><seg type="columnLine">of old age, or hit her on the head?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meigler, who had been fidgeting uneasily, raised his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">in horror at Hance's curt words, but the litde man turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him like a darting snake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shut up!" Hance commanded harshly and then swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to face Gregg. "See here, Gregg, when you signed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me on as mech with these other fellers you told us the game</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was tricky but not dangerous, but you was damn short on</seg><seg type="columnLine">information. Now me, I'm willing to take a chance, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air or out of it, if there's a hunk of cash in it for me, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meigler, he's getting all upset and hysterical-like. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">we want to know is, when do we cash in and beat it? Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was going great till this other girl blew in, but now</seg><seg type="columnLine">it looks like you'd lost yer grip."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You think so, do you?" Gregg said calmly. "What's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong is diat you've lost your nerve, all three of you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, if you think you can get out of this mess widiout me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when all Long Island's on the lookout, why go ahead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused a moment, but although Hance started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak he thought better of it Gregg went on, a sneer in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That girl in the closet you're so excited about simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">means about twenty thousand cash for us.

Back out of this now and 1*11 see you do time witli</seg><seg type="columnLine">me; stick, and I promise you big money. It's up to you!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The big man who stood with arms akimbo before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">closet door looked at Hance. Meigler shuffled his feet un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily. The little spokesman looked at neither of them; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was absorbed in a shrewd scrutiny of Gregg.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Hance spoke again there was a conciliatory note</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his voice. "Me, I'm game to go through wid it, but this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bimbo-" he looked contemptuously over his shoulder at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Meigler, "is gettin' jumpy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no!" Meigler exclaimed hastily. "You misunder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand me. But I would like to know just what has nap</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pened and is going to happen. That girl-" His voice</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">trailed off weakly as he looked toward the closet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah," said Hance. "What's die lay, boss? Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">do we skip from here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're with me then?" Gregg asked, still icily indif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure we are," Hance assured him. "Ain't never been</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything else. But what's die scenario of this mix-up?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Simply this," replied the pilot "By ten o'clock today--</seg><seg type="columnLine">within five hours--this affair will be over. I will be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy bridegroom, with a wife who is wealthy in her own</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. I will have not only the rosy prospects I mentioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you before, but a substantial sum in hand which will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">divided among you. That will be your bonus for the added</seg><seg type="columnLine">risks--and perquisites--Miss Roweton lias involuntarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe so, boss, maybe so," said Hance doubtfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But I don't mind telling you, since we're confidential-like,</seg><seg type="columnLine">diat I had my nose to the winder there, when Pen Elridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">breezed out o' the room and she didn't look like no blushin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">bride to me. She's more likely to get you pinched than</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry you, the way she slammed that door."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"T&gt;AH!" said Gregg scornfully. "Eavesdropping! Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">get out of here, all of you, and in five minutes I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have her looking like a bride again. Lock that closet door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, though."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With stolid precision the big man turned the key in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">closet door. No sound of protest came from within.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hance moved uneasily; the other two looked at him and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">under their obvious desire for leadership, he finally moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the outer door. Gregg surveyed his three follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers with a sardonic smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Remember," he said, "if you want to come out of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe--and rich--just obey my orders and don't ask ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. I've got a big surprise coming. Keep your nerve</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sit tight when it breaks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's too many blasted surprises in this bunco party,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered Hance discontentedly. "But we gotta stick; we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">in too deep to get out widout a lifeline." Silently the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">filed out behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Left alone, Gregg turned to the other door, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">76</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Flying Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which Pen Elridge had made her sweeping exit. The de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">risive twist of the lips with which he had looked upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">aides was still upon his face as he went toward it. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Pen! Pen!" he called gently, with a note, scarcely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">louder than an echo, that hinted of distress in his voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was no answer and no stir that he could hear. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">knocked again, somewhat more insistently. "Pen," he re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">peated. "I must speak to you at once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Go away! I won't speak to you!" a muffled, uneven</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">voice wailed behind the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I'm sorry," Gregg said regretfully. "I did so want--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but never mind, Pen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The door swung open. Pen, flushed of chcek and with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eyelids somewhat swollen, stood before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What do you want?" the girl demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rTHE pilot instantly took possession of her hands and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his head drooped over them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Pen, Pen," he murmured. "What do you think I want?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">To quarrel with you on this--this day?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">An expression of smug satisfaction passed over Pen's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sharp features, as she looked down upon this humble lover.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Have you tired of talking to--that Coralie Roweton</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing?" she inquired, her tone still far from amiable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Gregg looked up suddenly. His eyes were big with re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">proach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Pen, Pen," he chided. "How you misunderstand me!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Do you know where Coralie is now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Go on," said the girl eagerly. "Have you sent her away ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Gregg pointed a quivering, dramatic finger at the closet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"She is in there, locked up, and there she stays to pre-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vent trouble-making until we are married--or until you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tell me that all is over between you and me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Penelope Elridge turned a triumphant, scintillating pair</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of eyes on the door, behind which Coralie was supposedly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">languishing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I care not what laws I shatter, what penalties I face--</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you!" the pilot rushed on, but his task was over. Pen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elridge melted rapturously into his arms, murmuring en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dearments. And over her shoulder he flashed that same,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ironical smile, as he responded to her in loverlike language.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But dear, we must be sensible," he whispered after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few moments had passed. Ever so gently he disengaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. ''1 must give orders to my men. If anything</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">should occur to mar our wedding-" His tongue could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">find no words to voice his horror, but his mobile face mir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rored it for an instant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He strode to the front door and flung it open. "Hance!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Come in, all of you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Back into the living-room the three tramped. Jaws</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped as in response to Gregg's swift gesture they stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Pen Elridge.

I like the stories that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> are rip-roaring full of action, but the lovey-dovey stuff</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> is a washout. I think your authors are very clever and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> must have seen more or less of the world from the air</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    Believe me, I'nt not waiting until I get out of school to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> fly.

We girls are coming right along--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and there are a good many who are not afraid of mice,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spiders or snakes and who probably wouldn't be greatly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">worried up in a plane if the pilot suddenly got tired of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">liifing and did an outside loop!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   May I ask a question in closing? Is it possible for a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> girl to make a business of flying ?

To tell the truth, it has this editor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> at a disadvantage from the take-off. We are no more timid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> than most men. We've flown our share. We once nose-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> dived a bomber, loaded with 150 pounds of T. N.

If any one ever takes us up and puts</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> us through an outside loop, we'll spend the rest of our life</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">chasing him with a Lewis gun!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as to girls making a living, why not ? To be sure, lack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of money and lack of a job are serious handicaps, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible ones.

We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had some noble battles widi and against some of diem in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the streets of Paris in the wee sma' hours of the morning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We remember them with joy.

Bill Thaw, Norman Price, Victor Chapman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elliot Cowdin, Bert Hall, Clyde Balsley, Walter Lovell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harold Willis, Dave Lewis--we're recalling a few names</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a few faces from memory, some of them who have an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered the last roll-call of all. What a crew I We wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the survivors are, now? Now and then we run across</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them and, over a litde table, remember this pilot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that one. Some of them, though seldom heard of, are among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greatest heroes of all times, to our way of thinking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'T'HERE was Clyde Balsley, for instance. We don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how many planes he had to his credit, if any, but what</seg><seg type="columnLine">a youngster he was! A little fellow, perhaps five feet six, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one of the very first of the little group to form what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dien called the Franco-American Flying Corps. On one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his first trips over die lines he received an explosive</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet in the stomach. For a year or more he lay in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American Ambulance Hospital in Neuilly, undergoing one</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation after another. Wc, who had known him when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he drove an American Ambulance, thought he had died. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to Paris, early in 1917, and heard that he lived,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a fashion. We called the hospital. He was being dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged that day. We met at Henri's, over a table. He told</seg><seg type="columnLine">us that he was leaving die following day for the front as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine-gunner. He could no longer pilot, of course--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was almost a hopeless cripple, but he could point a machine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun, so the French had at last permitted him to do so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Courage? Of a kind seldom encountered in our experience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We met him once more, quite by accident. In Washing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, just before the Armistice, we noticed a familiar looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">little figure hobbling down 16th Street. He wore the uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of an American captain. Reminded of some one, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked again and there was Balsley, the marks of suffering</seg><seg type="columnLine">indelibly etched on his face, but the indomitable courage</seg><seg type="columnLine">still flashing in his eyes. The American Army was making</seg><seg type="columnLine">use of his knowledge and experience, but he regretted being</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">3,000	miles from the combat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again we lost track of him and have heard nothing from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him since.

It stood on</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiptoe and climbed on running boards and automo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bile tops with hundreds of eyes focused on one point of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field. Members of the squadron, waiting to fly or tending</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships, cautioned each other to stand back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out on the field, just past the hangars, where ships came</seg><seg type="columnLine">in and took off, a man lay on the ground beside a plane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two other men stood nearby and the flight surgeon was</seg><seg type="columnLine">kneeling beside the prostrate figure. "What was the mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter ?" came the collective query. The plane was intact. "Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">he been hit by the propeller ?'' every one asked. Apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">not. Had he fallen out of the plane? No, he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged out of the plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It became apparent that members of the squadron were</seg><seg type="columnLine">snickering and telling each other something very funny.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently the man on the ground opened his eyes and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">half helped, half dragged into a hangar, several squadron</seg><seg type="columnLine">members following him with broad grins and allegedly witty</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarks. One forlorn, searching glance at the crowd was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only sign of interest he exhibited. The center of the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene was Private Jones and Private Jones was very ill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few moments before, the plane in which he had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">passenger had gone through a series of stunts, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the squadron's regular practice, but Jones, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepted an opportunity, rare with him, for a flight while hid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the fact that he had been upset since morning from</seg><seg type="columnLine">"something he ate at breakfast," had lost the battle with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was very unfortunate for Private Jones, because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all men in the squadron, it would cost him most in painful</seg><seg type="columnLine">jibes. And he knew that the plea that he had already been</seg><seg type="columnLine">ill would only aggravate matters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some one had once called Jones the Helmet and Goggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brigade because Jones' connection with flying was, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared, chiefly in the fact that he wore helmet and goggles</seg><seg type="columnLine">on almost any and, some said, all occasions. At least he wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">them well. The more romantic spirit of aviation was never</seg><seg type="columnLine">without its representative when Jones was present.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old-time mechanics, highly trained experts who made</seg><seg type="columnLine">their living keeping the squadron's planes in shape, and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">members of the national guard outfit, took great delight in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones, the "ground flyer," and although it was this very</seg><seg type="columnLine">kidding that reduced Jones' opportunities for flying, the spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the kidding gradually became confused with the idea that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones was a little bit afraid of flying, or perhaps altogether</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So when Jones became ill, it was practically taken for</seg><seg type="columnLine">granted that he had became ill because he had been scared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The whole result was that Jones was almost completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheated of the flying instruction most enlisted men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">given just as a favor by the pilots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One situation aggravated another. Those who "rode"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones couldn't know that he sat all day long on his stool at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the offices of the hardware house where he was bookkeeper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dreamed about flying. Flying was in his brain, in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles, his fingers and in his very soul. He lived it, ate it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slept it, and when he had enlisted in the squadron two</seg><seg type="columnLine">years before, he had at once purchased helmet and goggles</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and some of the men swore he had never taken them off since.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So when he strode along the edge of the field with his hel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">met and goggles and his serious, romantic air, thrilling at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glances from the crowd outside the fence, the squadron</seg><seg type="columnLine">members had yelled "Helmet and Goggle Brigade" at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus he didn't get so much flying as he might have, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">urge was still in his soul and so it made him strut more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wear his helmet and goggles more and talk bigger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The more he posed the less he flew and the less he flew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more he posed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jones lay in the hangar, slowly recovering and wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">if "she" had seen his humiliation. The glance over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder as they were dragging him in showed that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not standing where he had seen her just before he went up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He prayed she had gone. Every Sunday, the regular drill</seg><seg type="columnLine">day of the squadron, and some other days, too, he had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">her there at the fence and longed to know her--and dreaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew she had been watching him, knew he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">"knocked her cold." But he was afraid his bubble would</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst if she met him and thus came in contact with other</seg><seg type="columnLine">members of the squadron who would, of course, generously</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply her with details about his "flying."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thought, too, lying there, about the endless kidding he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in for because he had become ill while flying. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">get old, old, old--that kidding. They'd drive him mad. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">quit. If they didn't let up he'd quit next month. He'd give</seg><seg type="columnLine">them one month and then good-by to his dreams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But a week or so later Jones' illness, Jones and, in fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically every other individual member of the squadron</seg><seg type="columnLine">was forgotten in the excitement over reports from the state</seg><seg type="columnLine">capital. For, it appeared, the squadron was facing the pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibility of an amputation or even complete annihilation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ANEW governor had been elected and the new governor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had appointed a new adjutant-general. The new ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jutant, who is head of the national guard, was expected to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show Washington in a fact-and-figure report that each unit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the national guard would be cared for under the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">administration equally as well as it was under the old.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Any unit, especially one as expensive as the squadron,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the adjutant-general mentioned negligently or which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he neglected to mention at all, was likely to suffer in Wash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ington. It appeared that in the squadron's case, the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">outfit might be eliminated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It further appeared that present indications were the ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jutant-general wouldn't give the squadron much attention.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The new head of the state military, it seemed, being an old-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time politician and an older-time military man, had, as old-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time military men arc often accused, little interest in aviation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To him, it was feared, that branch of the service, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of it at all, still appeared as a fanciful experiment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Major Walters, the squadron's commanding officer, inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viewed the governor and he interviewed the adjutant-general.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These gentlemen were polite but their minds were elsewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">so soon after election.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the members of the squadron worried and cussed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped desperately while the shears that were to clip her</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings snapped closer and closer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a pleasant Saturday morning in the private office</seg><seg type="columnLine">of His Excellency Thomas I.

He reached in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a desk drawer and found his helmet and goggles. Sunday</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon was drill period and the whole squadron was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways at the field to fly but on Saturdays there would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">several pilots out and only a few men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maybe he would get a hop for a change.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the field, a few minutes later, Jones went to the locker</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, dressed himself in his light flying suit and fitted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet and goggles carefully on his head. He had noticed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of sightseers already hanging on the fence and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to be in the midst of the glory of flying.

The governor has an offi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cial paper in Johnsonville, which lie wants brought here this</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon. Can you have one of the Falcons ready to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">by eleven-thirty?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir," replied Bill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going to fiy it myself. And, say, I don't want to cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">any false hopes or to appear foolishly excited, but this looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">like our chance. It's the first time they've paid us any at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention at all and when we bring this paper back, it will prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably get some action in our favor. At least it will give us</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to work on. And, at any rate, we'll certainly ruin</seg><seg type="columnLine">all our chances if we don't get it back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, sir. We'll service a ship right away and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">it ready for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, somebody," Bill shouted back into the hangar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"let's get this Falcon out. Major Walters is going to John-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonville."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the others gathered around the big plane he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained to them that the sun, in all probability, was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rise and dispel all their troubles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eagerly, the other mechanics, aided by Jones and a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">other enlisted men who had been loafing at the field, pushed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">warmers. And, Bill, you better go with him to keep him</seg><seg type="columnLine">from getting nervous."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jones was silent. He had been expecting something like</seg><seg type="columnLine">this from somebody, and Blackie seemed to have it in for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him worst of all. He'd tell Blackie a few when he got back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Private Jones pressed his fingers on his helmet over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cars as Major Walters opened the throttle in the last stage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of warming up the engine. This would be Jones' first hop</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one of the squadron's Falcons. Heretofore, his flying,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as it had been, had been confined to training ships.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was a little dismayed by the terrific blast of air hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">back by the powerful Liberty's propeller. He could hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick his head above the cockpit without having his goggles</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost ripped from his head. He'd get used to it though, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HP HE windshield was a narrow strip of material similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">to celluloid or mica and served as a windshield only when</seg><seg type="columnLine">one kept his head firmly behind it. To add to Jones' dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfort, his windshield had a large gaping crack across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom where it had been broken loose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some awkward wrench slinger had set himself upon it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and snapped loose several of the rivets which fastened it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">its frame and thence to the rim of the cockpit It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder, Jones told himself in annoyance, that some of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows didn't fall through the wings every time they got near</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It might be dangerous if that thing came loose while they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were flying. He comforted himself by inspecting it closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">84</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">F lying Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and discovering that most of the rivets were still holding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheet of mica firmly, too firmly for any wind to rip it loose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the air the big plane roared away, climbing, climbing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing. At two thousand feet the major leveled off in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of Johnsonville. Jones stood up in the deep ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">server's cockpit to look around. The terrific wind pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his nose and closed his nostrils, took his breath and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whipped his goggles cross-wise on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat down to adjust his goggles. He'd have to get used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to these Falcons. They were certainly a different proposi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. He imagined himself flying the Falcon, reached out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the control stick before him, which moved gently as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the major moved his own in the other cockpit. He touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet gently on the rudder pedals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No--he couldn't quite see himself flying this monster, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">admitted. It was so different from the lighter training ships.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One dared hardly look over the cockpit's rim, the big wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">hid so much of the view and when the big plane wobbled or</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit an air bump it was with so much greater force than in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slower planes to which Jones was accustomed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T)RIVATE JONES had often imagined himself the hero</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an accident wherein the pilot should become disabled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Jones should bring the plane safely to ground. Although</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had never actually hoped that this would occur, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a great deal more fervor in his hope that it would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, because he felt that he would certainly be helpless in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this roaring air dragon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The field at Johnsonville had never before seen a Falcon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Private Jones basked in the glory of his almost contemp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuous familiarity with it and answered questions for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious, while Major Walters sought a telephone to inquire</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the paper which had not been brought to the field as</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few minutes Major Walters returned to the ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mumbling remarks too livid to be delivered aloud. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper, it seemed, had not been signed or something. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">person to whom the major had talked said he would have it</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the field in an hour--he hoped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A stiff and rising breeze, which had sprung up from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of Steelville, failed to cool the major's ire. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact it seemed to fan the flames higher and when the major</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed low, gray clouds scuttling up out of the south, fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed by blacker ones down on the horizon, the livid remarks</seg><seg type="columnLine">heretofore mumbled were announced loudly and in a clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice for instruction of all who might wish to listen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The clouds promised certain rain. There was no escap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it. The head wind would delay them greatly and if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were delayed until darkness caught them in the rain, disaster</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be ilmost certain. Well, if it got too late, he just</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't try it, and that was all there was to it, the major</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided with colorful comments diercon. Just the luck to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be expected though.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just when the opportunity arrived to attract a little fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vorable attention from officialdom it seemed it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned into unfavorable attention. While the former did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessa. ilv mean that the squadron would be saved, the latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost certainly meant its doom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An hour passed, and in spite of the fact that the major</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not expected the paper in the hour promised, he renewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his torrid comments with new and original trimmings. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the fifth minute of the next five elapsed, a taxi hurtled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few ditches on the edge of the field and crashed to a stop in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of the hangar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The major took one look at the man climbing out of it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutching a heavy manila envelope, and shouted to the me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanics on hand to start his motor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Private Jones waited for no instructions. He climbed hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riedly into the cockpit, adjusted his goggles and fastened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety belt. The major climbcd in, in front of him, halting</seg><seg type="columnLine">long enough to shout that he thought they could make it all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jones looked above him at the sky, now completely over-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cast and sending tentative warnings, drops of water to earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The clouds shut off the sun almost completely and made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time appear much later than it was. Above the roar of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine Jones sensed an ominous hush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon the drops increased in frequency and a few moments</seg><seg type="columnLine">later they were cutting across his face like red-hot needles</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in such quantity that the nose of the big ship was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely visible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Private Jones was uneasy, became much more uneasy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then finally gave himself over to wishing fervently that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never come on this mission. He trusted the major's</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying implicitly but now they were skimming along at an</seg><seg type="columnLine">altitude of one hundred and fifty feet and die strong head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind reduced die ship's ground speed alarmingly, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"bumps" met at the low altitude tossed the plane angrily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jones sincerely hoped that the long-imagined incident</seg><seg type="columnLine">should not occur and that the major would be in command</seg><seg type="columnLine">of every faculty, including several spares. The very thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him panicky. Of course nothing could happen to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">major on his own account, but what, he thought, if some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one had left a wrench or something on top of the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">section and this should fall off on the major's head. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">craned his neck to see that the center section was clear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Or what, he thought, if something should tear loose in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engine and strike the major.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After what seemed to Jones hours, his misery, which at</seg><seg type="columnLine">times had entered the stages of terror, gradually began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">abnte and he began attempts to survey the landscape in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to establish their location. lie knew that even with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head-winds they must be nearly home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ceiling by this time had lifted to about 1,200 feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of the fact that the rain seemed to have increased its</seg><seg type="columnLine">intensity and the heavens to have become darker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jones abandoned attempts to look over the side of the cock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit when the terrific blast from the propeller, now heavily</seg><seg type="columnLine">rain laden, threatened to tear the skin from his cheeks. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">great plane roared on and Jones could not conceive of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">one being able to fly it with the nose and wing-tips well nigh</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He examined the windshield in front of him again for lack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of anything else to do. He took off his goggles and wiped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rain away. Thus he was reminded of something which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rain had obscured. The broken windshield. A thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck him almost physically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly he decided to brave the tearing wind and rain for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment to raise his head and look at the major's windshield.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To his horror, what he had feared was true--but worse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The same lazy oil-squirter who had sat upon the windshield</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Jones' cockpit had repeated his show of lack of intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gence in the strip of mica on the forward cockpit. But it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">being smaller, had suffered more. Almost the entire line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rivets had been torn away, only one on each end remaining,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the sheet of mica was snapping about in the angry blasts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rain and tearing wind existed for Jones no more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TLTE tore loose the buckle on his safety belt and stood up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. He reached over and touched the major on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder to warn him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pilot shook his head violently and Jones tumbled back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his seat, licking his lips feverishly. The major was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy flying the ship to look around. Perhaps he had noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the damaged windshield already and would curse Jones for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fool when he found out what he wanted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jones bit his knuckles in agony and glanced at the pilot's</seg><seg type="columnLine">windshield. It seemed that those two lonely rivets could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly endure that wind except through a miracle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He jerked his safety belt loose once more. Perhaps the</seg><seg type="columnLine">major would curse him for a fool. On the other hand, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">might both be killed if he kept silent. The major's head was</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly behind the mica. He pulled himself to his feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached for the major's shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, the broken windshield ceased snapping about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It bent low, horizontal to the wind.

He pitched forward against the stick, then against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cockpit's side and lay still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great ship, with a shudder, engine full on, tore nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward in an almost perpendicular dive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jones fell back into his seat, dazed with terror. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment his eyes refused to see and his arms refused to move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something reminded him to get the ship on a level. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull back on his stick. Half consciously he put his feet on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rudder pedals, grasped the stick and braced himself. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane trembled all over as its speed passed the two-hundrcd-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles-per-hour mark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All of Jones' world resolved into that stick he clutched in</seg><seg type="columnLine">both his hands.

Pull it back and the ship would level off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pull it back and fix things up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pulled. The stick refused to budge. He pulled with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strength of legs and arms until it seemed his temples</seg><seg type="columnLine">would burst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HP HAT damned motor! How could a man pull a ship out</seg><seg type="columnLine">-*• of a dive with the motor dragging it down faster and</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster. The throttle! Jones'left hand released die stick for</seg><seg type="columnLine">one panicky moment and shut off the throttle. In that split</seg><seg type="columnLine">second he remembered he had been told that in a dive it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the motor that was most likely to help him out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shoved the throttle wide open again. Then back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stick. The terror caused by the lost time brought re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">newed strength in the pull, another fiber straining pull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She answered a little. More pull, and gradually the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane leveled off. The terrific force of flattening out pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones low in his seat.

His hand shot out to the throttle again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pushed it timidly and then he realized it was already wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">open. So concentrated had he been on the business of getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plane out of that horrible dive that he had hardly even</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the engine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jones' senses cleared somewhat and, with temporary re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lief from the first, horrible moment, reaction seized him. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand trembled on the throttle so that lie removed it for fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of closing it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His other hand shook so that he had to cling to the stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">with desperate strength. His knees shook violently as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">braced his feet harder against the rudder pedals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although Jones had no account of how long the plane had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dived at that terrific speed, it had in reality descended only</seg><seg type="columnLine">about seven hundred feet so that he still had a good five hun-.</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet altitude. But the ground looked too close and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">added to his terror as his recovering senses brought to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">again the ferocious wind and rain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was flying level at any rate, but he realized that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship was capable of flying thus, alone for a short time, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that any moment it might demand action on his part. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">clung to the controls desperately and licked his feverish lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally he decided to force the issue and ventured to gain</seg><seg type="columnLine">altitude. His piloting experience was vague and he had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea how steep the ship would climb. As a result he put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose up too much and presently was forced to realize that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plane was threatening to stall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">This terrified him so that he forced the nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">too low and lost most of the altitude he had gained. Pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently, however, he succeeded in striking an angle suitable for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a straight, slow climb and settled back to wait for twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet before he permitted himself even to think.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At twelve hundred feet, he came to the realization that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't the remotest idea in what direction he was headed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked overside and was overjoyed to find, in the dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">mist below him, a low ridge, dotted with houses, which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized as being on the edge of Steelville.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After fqrther inspection he discovered that he wa3 fly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing rapidly away from the field, back in the direction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnsonville. During this inspection he permitted the plane's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nose to get too high again, almost stalled, whipped around</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a terrifying bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He snapped the plane upright with the ailerons, neglecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to adjust his rudder and skidding badly, the fuselage vibrat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing uneasily in the heavy side wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pushed the rudder too far the other way, then too far</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. Presently, however, he brought the ship to a fair de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gree of steadiness. He now discovered that he was headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">lengthwise of the ridge, but still away from the field. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a wide and cautious bank and headed in what he judged</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the direction of the field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now a new and, it seemed, the most terrifying problem of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all faced him. He would be over the field shortly and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to land, possibly the most difficult part of all flying for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a student. Jones had had no instruction whatever in land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, had never so much as touched die controls during a land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Worse, he knew that even the most experienced pilots at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Robins Field, who never before had flown a Falcon, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">given lengthy and careful instructions in landing before be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing permitted to take up one of die big ships.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Besides that, it was almost dark and, although he had be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come more accustomed to the propeller's terrific wind and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly less terrified by the rain, it still seemed impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him to fly the plane very successfully for long.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His goggles had become hopelessly fogged and he tore</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from his head and cast them aside. He strained his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes to look through the rain, over the ship's nose. Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon he saw two familiar smokestacks which rose from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnace a few hundred yards from the edge of the field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Agonizing fear held him. It was small comfort that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">downpour was now only a light rain. It had grown darker</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he had noticed no slackening in the rain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His knees began to tremble again. Death, real death, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a character in an imagined incident, stared at him from be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the flashes of the whirling propeller.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He couldn't make it.

He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten completely that wonderful saver of lives, required</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all army flyers. He'd get to windward of the field, jump</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and let the damn ship fly to hell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ordinarily he would have laughed at any one who sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested he make a parachute jump.

Good Lord, what could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Shep be thinking! That maid with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him couldn't fly a ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And besides, I saw that Shep, be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cause of his high altitude, the winds</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or something, was going to land out-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">side the clearing, outside the circle of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flames which hedged the clearing in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">His chute filled with air and he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">striving with might and main, by pull-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing on the shrouds, to get into the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flame-swept clearing. His ship was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spinning down, too, and I watched for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">another figure, the figure of the maid,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to come catapulting down, behind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Shep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But no such figure showed, and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spinning ship disappeared behind the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">side of a mountain shoulder as we,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tex and I, banked around and came</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">back. Well, Tex couldn't land here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Neither could Shep. It looked sort of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up to me.

Heine, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">is now in the automobile business in De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">troit, was the first to use colored smoke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was in April, 1924, when he wrote</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here again. The colored smoke was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not entirely successful, but we got some</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideas."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN the Skywriting Corpora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion is assigned to a new job, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilots are acquainted with the message</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be written in the air. They work on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackboard at first, until they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">figured out the shortest way in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cover the entire group of letters. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">practice in the air until they have it let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter-perfect. They dare almost anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">except the possibility of an error in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spelling. Thus far, no one has invented</seg><seg type="columnLine">a suitable eraser to eliminate a mistake</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No two pilots write alike," said Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cameron. "I can tell who is up by</seg><seg type="columnLine">glancing at the writing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All writing is done on a horizontal</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane, of course, as it would be im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible otherwise for the people below</seg><seg type="columnLine">to read it. Furthermore, it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible for a plane of the type used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to climb at an angle steep enough for</seg><seg type="columnLine">vertical writing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At ten thousand feet the prevailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind is westerly and gentle. To per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form effectively a pilot requires a steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze, or, still better, no wind at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are always at the mercy of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather," Mr. Cameron explained. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is necessary to have a clear, blue sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a steady wind not exceeding forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are, however, exceptions to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this rule. If the message is to he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptionally brief, it is practical to write</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a wind at fifty miles an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We had a job over Philadelphia in</seg><seg type="columnLine">February, 1928," Mr. Cameron recalled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"to advertise Lindbergh's story, 'We,'</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the Philadelphia Bulletin. We made</seg><seg type="columnLine">those letters over a mile long. We could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done it in a high wind, but as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened we got a lucky break in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A variable wind makes sky-writing</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible. The pilot, when he quits</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground, must allow for wind velo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">city. He nearly always starts the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter far into the wind, so that by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he has finished the word, it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">hang directly over the city. He must</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever keep the letters aligned. Ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cording to Mr. Cameron, no two flyers</seg><seg type="columnLine">employ the same scheme in getting this</seg><seg type="columnLine">result. One will use the Hudson river</seg><seg type="columnLine">in lining his words over New York.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Another selects a long avenue, or street.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A third gets results by holding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow of one wing strut across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same rib of his lower wing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With letters half a mile high and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter of a mile wide, the average</seg><seg type="columnLine">message extends from four to six miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">in length. Down below, the gaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">throngs will watch a curving plane as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">covers tliis distance in the space of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes. It seems to write with</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost leisurely strokes and suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the word is finished, the plane itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">is momentarily invisible. It is then that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pilot has cut off die smoke valve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have any of your men ever cracked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up?" I asked Mr. Cameron.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. They've been lucky, or too</seg><seg type="columnLine">clever. They always have altitude and</seg><seg type="columnLine">if anything goes wrong they've got a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good chance to glide to a landing some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where. And of course, our men are so</seg><seg type="columnLine">at ease in the air that it is second na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture for diem to handle their ships in</seg><seg type="columnLine">emergency."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain O.

Once I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a whole month of unlucky breaks. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">began when 1 had to get out and push</seg><seg type="columnLine">my machine about in a muddy field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In so doing I wrenched my back</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather painfully--afterwards I discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered one of the vertebrae was broken.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My doctor put me in plaster for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">days, and it looked as though I was out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flying for some time to come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But just then came the great general</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike. All the aircraft in the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">were pressed into service, for carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mails and distributing newspapers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After much persuasion my good doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed to let me up, after winding thirty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">•six yards of adhesive tape around me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and making me promise I would never</seg><seg type="columnLine">straighten up (physically) till he let me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF course I intended to keep my</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise, and I set out with the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">of intentions of taking care of myself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Frank T. Courtney, who later</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the Transatlantic attempt from</seg><seg type="columnLine">England, said I had the funniest lug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gage he had ever seen. I toured the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country with a blue eider-down quilt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie on at night, together with three or</seg><seg type="columnLine">four strong pillows and a strong walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-stick for ground use.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I flew regularly with consignments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Daily Mail, which we pilots dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tributed to all the cities when the rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roads ceased to run. After four or five</seg><seg type="columnLine">days I found I could straighten up all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right--and who would want to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">around all humped up any longer than</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now came the problem of taking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">adhesive tape off. Any one who has tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remove a porous plaster will have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint idea of my predicament, with over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred feet of tape glued to my 9kin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tried hot water, gasoline, turpen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tine--nothing would touch it. It hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much at every pull that I began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear I was permanently mummified in</seg><seg type="columnLine">adhesive tape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But finally I had a bright thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went to a local dentist. He very</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindly put me to sleep with his gas, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I was mercifully unconscious he</seg><seg type="columnLine">peeled off the tape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were some twenty light planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in use during the strike, which flew some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">100.000	miles and helped greatly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping the papers and mails going. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">little "Moths" like mine flew over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">10.000	miles without a mishap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next break was my own fault en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely. I was carrying about 200 pounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of newspapers, from Folkestone to Lon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don, and was rash enough to swing my</seg><seg type="columnLine">propeller with the switch on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It immediately backfired, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the first finger and thumb of my left</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand were broken. It really was not as</seg><seg type="columnLine">painful as it sounds--it numbed me at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time, but the pain did not start till</seg><seg type="columnLine">half an hour later, when I was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four days later I was bitten again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">also through my own fault. It was an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other occasion on which I paid for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceit. I was on a military flying field,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a score of officers and mechanics</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, only too eager to help me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I wanted to show how easily I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could start my engine and plane unaided.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It backfired again. This time my right</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrist was broken. I felt I had to go on</seg><seg type="columnLine">and finish the journey, for many were</seg><seg type="columnLine">depending upon me. But it was rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrifying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fortunately, I was alone, or I certain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly would not have flown, for I felt sick</seg><seg type="columnLine">and weak with the pain. Unable to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stick either with my bandaged left</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand or my newly broken right one, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">held the joystick in the hollow of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">right elbow, keeping it in place with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of my left hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I flew very low and slowly, so that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not hit too hard if I did faint and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose control. I managed to pull through</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right, which shows what one can do</seg><seg type="columnLine">when necessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although self-starters have been used</seg><seg type="columnLine">on airplanes, so far they have proved too</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy and cumbersome. One of the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">things the student learns is how to start</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own engine. It is really very easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">on light engines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You just place the palm of both hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the blade of the propeller, previously</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned as high as you can reach. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the switch turned off, you swing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blade several times, to draw gas into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylinders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, with the switch on, one easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">swing should start the engine with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bang. Of course, any engine will back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire sometimes, but this will cause no</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger if your fingers do not grasp the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the blade. Too tight a grip on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crank-handle of an automobile will</seg><seg type="columnLine">do quite as much damage to hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms as the wrong grip on a propeller.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's just a case of knowing how and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">being careful--automatically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went into flying because it entranced</seg><seg type="columnLine">me from the first. My first trip in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, however, was made because I was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hurry. I had just heard of the open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of an International Athletic Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference in Prague. It was the very next</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, so the only way I could get there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to fly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 called the nearest air-field, found a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot and plane, and so embarked on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying career. From that day on I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been "up in the air" just as much as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"pARACHUTE drops appear more</seg><seg type="columnLine">± thrilling to the ground observer than</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the performer. I made many drops</seg><seg type="columnLine">during my exhibition and "barnstorm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing" tours, but one adventure stands out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my recollection as the least expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the most thrilling. It was one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my closest calls, for it might have ended</seg><seg type="columnLine">very seriously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was stunting at Hereford, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make a parachute drop from a plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">piloted by a very skilful pilot--I believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if he had not been so skilful I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be telling this tale today. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had climbed out of the cockpit, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the point of jumping into space at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word from my pilot, when suddenly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine went wrong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was quite a different drop and land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing than either of us had expected--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowd either. Only the pilot knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">how we managed to miss trees and vari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous other obstacles to a peaceful landing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wondered more than once, before our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">When answering advertisements</seg><seg type="columnLine">May, 1929</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Flying Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">95</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">feet were safely on Mother Earth again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether it would not have been as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have hopped off and taken my chances</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fouling the machine as it fell. I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you more about that mishap when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">recount my parachute experiences.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONE of my most remarkable and</seg><seg type="columnLine">least expected of adventures oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curred during my 11,000-mile flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Cape Town to England. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived in Central Africa for some years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I well knew the dangers of the sun's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays near the equator. No white person</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposes his head to those actinic rays,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless he wishes to end it all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when I was flying the 430-mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">hop from Pretoria to Bylawayo, on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">long flight, I was twenty-one degrees</seg><seg type="columnLine">south of the equator. Anticipating no</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble, I wore only my flying helmet</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was gazing down at the flat plains and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills ahead of me, when suddenly I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dull ache in the back of my head, neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I	had had two light attacks of sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroke, and knew well enough what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was up against But my belated efforts</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were too late to stave off unconscious-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ness. I remember saying to myself,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well, my dear, you have flown</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">your last flight 1 and heading my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plane for the ground. Then all went</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">black. I shall tell you later on how and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">where I awoke--by no means certain, at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">first, that I had not landed in the next</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">world, with dark-skinned angels to wait</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upon me!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Flying for me has not been loads of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">healthy fun, but all over the world I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have met the finest of good, clean, pleas-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ant people. Every one in aviation is al-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ways doing his or her best for every</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one else.
