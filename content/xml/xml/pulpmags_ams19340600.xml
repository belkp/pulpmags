However, this may be, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is certain that in the matter of numerical</seg><seg type="columnLine">roots and powers, a child can go up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in a sense it is virtually impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some cases to do the descending move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment with final accuracy. Thus the</seg><seg type="columnLine">square of two is four; its cube is eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so on. If we want to extract the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cube root of eight, it lies right before</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, it is two. But as a variation on this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as a simpler thing to do on its face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack the extraction of the square root</seg><seg type="columnLine">of eight. It will he found to have a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">decimal, part of it, reading 2.8284.....</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But this is only the beginning of it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the decimal will be mercilessly long.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The number two ought to be very simple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but if you try to extract its square root</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you will get another decimal without</seg><seg type="columnLine">end. It starts off as 1.441402. . . . You</seg><seg type="columnLine">may multiply this by itself, which multi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plication will give its square, but it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be exactly two because the decimal</seg><seg type="columnLine">is incomplete. The same will apply to</seg><seg type="columnLine">your efforts to get the square root of</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight. Now if you will try to extract</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cube root of two, you will again</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a patience-trying problem and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">endless decimal in the end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is in this last named extraction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cube root of two a historical</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest.

In the case of two solids</seg><seg type="columnLine">of similar shape, if one is to be twice</seg><seg type="columnLine">the volume of the other, then the length</seg><seg type="columnLine">of similar corresponding parts must vary</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the cube roots of these lengths.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus if an edge of a cube has a length</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one, the edge of a cube to be of eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">times the volume must have for its edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">a length expressed by the cube root of</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight which is two, as we have seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">above. This is simple enough. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">cube one foot on an edge is only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one-eighth the volume of one with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">edgc-length of two feet. But try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculate the length of the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cube, two cubic feet in volume. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are comparing the volume of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres, you can use the diameter for</seg><seg type="columnLine">your cubing, or your cube-rooting, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the case may be. Thus if a planet is</seg><seg type="columnLine">of twice the diameter of another it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be of eight times the volume of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller one. If you have two vessels</seg><seg type="columnLine">of corresponding shape, one twice as</seg><seg type="columnLine">high and broad as the other, if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller one holds a pint, the larger one</seg><seg type="columnLine">will hold a gallon. The larger a tin</seg><seg type="columnLine">can is, the less tin will be required to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold a given amount. A number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">small cans for the same contents would</seg><seg type="columnLine">require more tin. If we go back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">days of Pythagoras or Archimedes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">make our two cubes, the one of twice</seg><seg type="columnLine">the volume of the smaller cube, will</seg><seg type="columnLine">have an edge of a little over one and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter times (1.261 . . .) that of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another problem is to find the diam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eter of a sphere of the same volume</seg><seg type="columnLine">as our original unit cube.

He is</seg><seg type="columnLine">said to have been so excited over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery, that he ran through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets as he came from the bath, crying</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eureka, Eureka, the Greek word for "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have found."

In his room, Mansfield</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully studies the hieroglyphics and, after submitting the manuscript to every known test,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is certain the document is genuine. It was written about 2800-2700 B. C. and by no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">person than the great Egyptian king. Cheops, himself. After hours of study, Mansfield has</seg><seg type="columnLine">the following data: Beneath the giant statue of a reposing body of an animal with a human</seg><seg type="columnLine">head is the only entrance to Atlantis. With the further instructions in the manuscript indelibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">printed on his mind, Sir John starts out for the great sphinx. After many disheartening attempts</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find an elusive spring given in the record, and governing the opening of the secret panel, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgustedly smashes the supposed spot and the panel slowly opens. He dashes into the opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as the panel starts to close, without realizing his sealed fate. Once inside, however, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch beam falls upon the inscribed walls and he forgets everything else.

The need of fresh air and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water leads Sir John down a dark passage which ends abruptly in a hole ten feet square,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost sending him into the pit.

There would have been little</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble, compared to getting into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple and capturing Venia, to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">secured other w'hite women; but, no, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone after the beautiful blonde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The outpost," stated Kodro in an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guish, "says that a large number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks covered the girl as they carried</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">her across.

And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mansfield readily read him. He pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessed an intense devotion for his off-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring.

Scores and scores of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were pouring out into the open streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thoroughfares.

The men of Atlantis have tol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erated the black race since the beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of time. We have stood for their peri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">odical displays, overlooking their brutal</seg><seg type="columnLine">natures, even trying to make respectable</seg><seg type="columnLine">men out of them. They are coarsely</seg><seg type="columnLine">ungrateful! Now . . . This is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time they shall suffer.

Into</seg><seg type="columnLine">units they divided, nothing like the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tidy mass of men who had met the on-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming blacks. Each unit had as its</seg><seg type="columnLine">head either a priest or man of science,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter distinguished by a sparkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">metallic tiara around the head. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided that the men were to proceed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man-eating wall; there the rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were centered upon the malignant</seg><seg type="columnLine">grayish matter were to be shut off in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one place; a unit armed with hand cyl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inders would drive the seething stuff into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main stretch and the overhead rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be thrown back on again. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">that manner it would be able to make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide channel in the grayish matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">through w'hich the men could pour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield was next to Yuxa, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of the main body of men, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of demarcation was reached. Up</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead, there could be seen already at</seg><seg type="columnLine">work the unit with the rays. In both di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rections, as far as the eye could reach,</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended the colorful emanation which</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarded the man-eating matter. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a beautiful creamy blue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The unit cleared a large hole directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the center and the men rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through, into an open plain. Far ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the lighted outline of the habitat</seg><seg type="columnLine">which harbored the blacks. But no</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of men was at hand to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">them!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Englishman thought it strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this progress without onslaught. If the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks had taken pains to secure the</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter of the high priest, they sure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly would have maintained a strong stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">in keeping her with them. But no</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush of blacks was evident which would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">show a dark body of men! Onward</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured the whites.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T* 5 ' V	q	" 'V ■</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY were soon on the outskirts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the village and Yuxa, with fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight, distributed his men accordingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were to surround the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, and give no quarter. Venia must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be secured even if every man had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stake his life. And not a black must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted to escape. All must be taken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But if there was a battle, it was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cidedly one-sided. For the white men</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Atlantis circled the entire black place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swooped down upon the buildings, pour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through the arched portals, and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">one black man was evident! There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobody there!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They poked through every interior for</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours without finding a trace of them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their amazement knew no bounds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yuxa was in a frenzy. It was now be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning to dawn upon the white men</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the black race had been even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">insidious than they had appeared. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no other place they could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone. The large number of them could</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely not have gone anywhere with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the whites being aware of it, yet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paradoxical fact remained squarely to</seg><seg type="columnLine">oppose them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY were scattered all over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, forcing prying eyes into any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that looked suspicious. Sir John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mansfield found himself a lone hand in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this affair, prodding his nose in and out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dwellings. They were rather fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone buildings, worthy of a better mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more stable temperament, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. The walls were tapestried with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine cloth drawings and designs, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">furniture was finely wrought of metal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The doors, however, were simple in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction, not similar to the walls in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple. It was comparatively easy to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">from room to room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was strange. The colony couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">14</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have transported itself into thin air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The blacks must be around here some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where. Mansfield wondered. Could they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have forseen this invasion and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">countermoved into the city of Atlantis</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same time the whites were go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through the man-eating wall? It</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly seemed probable. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">too many men about the temple; some</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrord would have come to them had thai</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found himself in a cellar wrhich</seg><seg type="columnLine">was littered with refuse. Carefully, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved around, inspecting the odds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ends which were heaped there. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">one corner the wall was almost obscured</seg><seg type="columnLine">from sight by a pile of trash. Detach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing piece by piece he placed them in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle of the room. Maybe there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was some reason for all this maze! But</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he had finally got a look at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">filthy wall, the slimy stone told him he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had failed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tt was arduous work, this tugging and</seg><seg type="columnLine">toting of the broken and misshapen</seg><seg type="columnLine">articles. His clothes were bedaubed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirt, and torn, and somewhat weary he</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved one of the broken chairs closer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">braced it against the wall and sat down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His cylinder which he had used more</seg><seg type="columnLine">as an illuminating projector than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon, was flashed around the base-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a wide and deep cellar. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper floor rested squarely upon a stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">foundation, without any support in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center. Well-built. And suddenly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped from his chair with a cry, as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">light played upon a tatter of a garment</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall nearby! In one</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound he reached it and snatched it up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was a clean piece of cloth which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no place in this grimy interior.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He'd swear he had seen the design</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere recently! Certainly he had!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He remembered it distinctly now. Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out of his unconscious state in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">upper chambers of the temple, just after</seg><seg type="columnLine">entering Atlantis, his eyes had fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the garment which clothed a body</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated near him. This tatter was a piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">torn from the robe of Venia!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This knowledge galvanized him. Venia</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed this way! She had struggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had parted with this. Down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bedraggled place she had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield stood firmly on his feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">poised for something he knew not what.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed to him that this remnant fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast imminent danger. It had some re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lation to the problem of the disappear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing blacks, that he was sure. And it</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant that somewhere near was the girl!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venia was nearby. He must not fail</seg><seg type="columnLine">her; he must be cautious!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He, first, must find out whether these</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls were false or not, whether the lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered cellar was only a blind to conceal</seg><seg type="columnLine">some hidden means of exit. Quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went around the walls and knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the blocks of stone for a hollow</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound. His thoughts were in a furor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had the daughter of the high priest</seg><seg type="columnLine">been done away with? This piece of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">robe spoke for itself. There had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a struggle. And a struggle, a resistance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought to Mansfield's shuddering mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">any possibility. Those creatures might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have taken their vengeance out on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and have killed her!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment he debated the idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastening up and bringing to light this</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery. The whites could wreck this</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellar in a short time and find out</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether there was a hidden spot about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But time would be lost. That wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. While he was hurrying upward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything might happen to the girl. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mansfield kept telling himself that Venia</seg><seg type="columnLine">was yet alive, that she couldn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been slain!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tapped with fierce energy. But a</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid echo kept ringing in his ears! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridiculed his haste! But he couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOST CITY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">15</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">give up--he couldn't! He was ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay his life down that this theory of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rag- was right; that everything lay right</seg><seg type="columnLine">here! His eager knife swept swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through cracks and cracks. Maybe a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slab would come loose! Working fran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically, of a sudden he felt his spine</seg><seg type="columnLine">shiver with an iciness that almost coag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ulated his blood, brought cessation to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his respiration. A voice was behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Ha! What fortune brings us the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger to Atlantis!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He whirled, throwing his light around</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he didn't need it. A huge negro,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare of clothing but for a filthy girdle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cloth, stood leering at him through</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked, yellow teeth. His beastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">scowl accentuated his abnormal nose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth, his body glistened with a sheen</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the small light he was holding fo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussed upon the Englishman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> AND then Mansfield saw the opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the wall behind the fellow. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">yawned blackly in a steep descent. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was right near the spot where he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up the tom cloth! What a fool</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been not to search there first!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">With a cry that rumbled from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">larynx, Mansfield leaped. Running</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his mind was his own con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">demnation for not getting assistance</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he had had time. For now, com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out of the hole was another and</seg><seg type="columnLine">another huge black! They carried clubs</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would have frightened away a be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hemoth! The odds were tremendously</seg><seg type="columnLine">against him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield struck the foremost black</seg><seg type="columnLine">squarely and together they crashed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor. In a moment legs and arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">were thrashing the air as the other two</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks were cast into the fight. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist's blood was gushing through</seg><seg type="columnLine">him at a high pressure, racing with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">madness that forced three blows where</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinarily he would have struck one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He laced out with his boot once and</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded in dislodging a face which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">its slashing fangs in his calf. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">men fought like carnivorous beasts! His</seg><seg type="columnLine">fists crunched venomously again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again upon abhorrent visages that</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunted, and he saw blood and blood!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was covered with the red stuff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A ferocious blow caught him fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the mouth and he went berserk. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang on the fellow nearest him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped his long arms about his neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">and choked him. Another blow struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">him glancingly on the side of the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and numbed his hold, throwing him</seg><seg type="columnLine">back against the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a moment's respite, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped for breath, surveying through</seg><seg type="columnLine">misty eyes the situation. One black was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ground moaning. That must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been the fellow he had kicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily in the face! But the other two,</seg><seg type="columnLine">battered and bruised, were slowly creep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing upon him, eyeing him through slitty</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbs. Mansfield took a deep breath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no way out of this now. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to yell with all his might to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whites to know he was in trouble!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he never opened his mouth. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">two blacks made swift disconcerting</seg><seg type="columnLine">moves, and one of them let fly the club!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It caught Mansfield right under the ear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was felled like a poled ox--a total</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness suffusing his consciousness!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER X</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Circular Pit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR all of Sir John Mansfield's</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of experience in the delv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in archaeological information</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerning races and peoples who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">existed down through the ages, the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">profundity of knowledge attained didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal one whit the experience he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now gathering in the very midst of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">historical, supposedly legendary people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">16</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he couldn't help but thinking now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lolling on the ground, trying to' assuage</seg><seg type="columnLine">that terrific ache which sprang from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost split head.

But a good two hours be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he had roused himself from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupor and had found that he was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this intensely dark place.

There wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">a white man who wouldn't give his life</seg><seg type="columnLine">to save the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rose groggily and steadied himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall. Still he could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. It was a Stygian blackness</seg><seg type="columnLine">which enveloped him. He stumbled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hugging the wall closely, fumbling along</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. He wondered what sort of room he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in. Perhaps there was some means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of escape from it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His hand, dragging back and forth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell across his hip and he let out a burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of surprised relief. His gun was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its holster, together with the car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tridges! What luck! The black cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors had not taken them from him. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not, apparently, understood their</seg><seg type="columnLine">importance, known their real value.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those animal-featured creatures would,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, not understand anything oth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOST CITY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">17</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">er than a ray cylinder, a club, or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife. They had paid no attention to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gun ! What fortune!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was an elation that in itself almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">healed the palpitating head. The pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence of his revolver meant to him more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than anything else right now. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand off a whole regiment of blacks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">given a point of vantage. His blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">tore through his veins and arteries with</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieking hope, with fired purpose. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">only he could find some way of getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of here, the better were his chances</seg><seg type="columnLine">for rescuing the girl. He must get out!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Venia must be gotten from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutches. He felt sure now that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">still lived. Hadn't they taken pains not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do away with him? Their only hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">in saving their own skins was to play a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tactful hand, and that they seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He must have progressed with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the wall for about fifty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the darkness suddenly gave way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">an illumination which threw the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">place into relief. He found himself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large chamber with a low ceiling. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">what brought his lips to a pursing whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle was the sight that met his eye. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet rested upon a narrow ledge about</seg><seg type="columnLine">three feet wide which ran away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, then dropped slopingly to the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the room, where there loomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a circular hole about ten feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HOW fortunate he was! Had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to prowl about before, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have undoubtedly stepped off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rim of the ledge and skidded downward</seg><seg type="columnLine">to that round pit which took on a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrifying aspect the longer he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at it. It was a sure means of self-de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His head was in a daze. His theory</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all shattered. They didn't care</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether he lived or not! Had he slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">here he would now probably have been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a dead man. Good Lord! He hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venia hadn't been thrown into this</seg><seg type="columnLine">place!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes met the blank stare of bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls. There seemed to be no opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">from this chamber. He stared long at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that circular pit below him, pondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">the idea of letting himself down from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ledge and finding out where the hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">led. The more he gazed around at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unending walls, the more attractive</seg><seg type="columnLine">loomed the possibility that the hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">might take him somewhere. If he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful and cautious, he could be sure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his footing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dropped over the flat rinj and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wriggled down slowly. His hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet moved with infinite precision. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a moment when he thought that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body was going- to fly from under him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his wet and perspiring hands clamped</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on the cold stone and nipped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the edge of the circular pit he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dug his hobnailed boots into the stone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting himself, and looked down. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful cry went from him as his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed at the unbelievable thing down</seg><seg type="columnLine">there! That hole was a receptable for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grayish man-eating matter! Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">one had seen that bubbling animal sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance, the eye would never forget it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the bluish iridescent ray hovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">over it, keeping it in check!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Great Heavens! He must get away</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly, back upon the ledge. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he tottered on this edge might</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean doom for him! What a fool he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been to take this horrible chance!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had he known what lay there nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the sun could have made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">slide down to it so lambently!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His fingers grasped the stone till they</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled, and he started to crawl back up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was nothing like the untroubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">descent but a moment before. The very</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of his narrow escape from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hideous death made his upward pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">18</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gress all the more severe. It was a deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief when his tensed fingers touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of the ledge and he drew himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it. His body was shaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FEEBLY he dropped in a crevice</seg><seg type="columnLine">next to the wall and exhaled hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible thoughts. The picture of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks being fed to the matter rose up</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him in virulent waves. It wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cherished end, any way one would</seg><seg type="columnLine">look at it. That unearthly stuff took</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and kept your passing a secr2t in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its fiendish heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shrunk against the wall, thank-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful for its protection. His hand fell over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the butt of his gun and caressed it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just give him one good break! Let him</seg><seg type="columnLine">get possession of Venia! And by thun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der he would fill every attacking black</seg><seg type="columnLine">with bullets! His mouth fastened into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grim line. All he wanted was just one</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack at those fiends. That he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown into such an awful place was</seg><seg type="columnLine">making him decidedly angry. The sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the man-eating stuff had turned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairness and tolerance to one side. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers itched to get around the throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a black.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was lying thus crouched when</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the corner of his eye he saw a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the wall just overhead slide up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward and a leering countenance show</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself. The black fellow was looking in</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see whether the prisoner had fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the pit. A huge mouth opened into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the semblance of a grin as he stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grisly pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spontaneously, Mansfield saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fate had opened its hand to his unuttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">plea. Here was his opportunity! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">black didn't see him because he lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly beneath him. But if the fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low decided to glance below, it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a simple matter to glimpse him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloating face, however, seemed content</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think that he had slid into the gray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a leap, Mansfield was out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched position, and he timed his out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched hands beautifully. The wiry</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers enveloped the black throat be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the other knew what happened. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific jerk, and the scientist had pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">him through the opening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a delightful feeling, this yield-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing neck in his hands. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrified look on the black face; it tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bite itself loose from the steely mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cles which was clamping out life. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">vocal muscles were paralyzed; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't cry out. The voice never was</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard again! Mansfield released him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he flew over the brink and crashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">head-first into oblique descent, striking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the circular pit, bounding di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectly across it to smash into the op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posite side, then dropped from view into</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hungry mass below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Englishman tottered on the ledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the exertion. It had carried him</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the wall, near the edge. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">a supreme effort he threw himself up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward and clutched the opened panel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It saved him instantly. He clung to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, breathing spasmodically; then, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">feline agility, he leaped through it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the other room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was an elaborate interior, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">many seats and lounges; and fortunately</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was empty. He had to work fast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though. In one motion he closed up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">panel and surveyed minutely the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE came to his hearing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of voices and like a flash he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped behind one of the large, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">decked chairs. From a narrow slit be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the rungs he saw a cloth being</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed aside and two blacks entered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They glanced about questioningly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One them said,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is Mantsi? He was supposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other strolled over to the panel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flung it open. "Look! The prisoner</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOST CITY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">19</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">has fallen into the pit! He is not there!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Good! He is one less white to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tend with!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mantsi must have gone up to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port it to Okrulla; Ha! Ha!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both fell into a laughing cackle which</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought utter disgust to the concealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. They were no more than beasts in</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotional expression. Mansfield could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see them sit down upon a lounge. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">widespread nostrils contract "d with each</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamy breath; their greenish orbs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">slits that moved around unceasingly with</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrifying effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the Englishman was tensed. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand was on his gun, eyeing every</seg><seg type="columnLine">move. Not now did he intend that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be taken a prisoner again without</seg><seg type="columnLine">retaliation. His fears were unfounded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however; one of them rose to his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leered:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We hold the upper hand now. Ok-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rulla will make those white devils come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us. He has the girl!" Both burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a loathesome sputter. "They think</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'll get her when Okrulla demands</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete freedom for us. Ha, ha! We</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall mow them down when they least</seg><seg type="columnLine">know it. The girl will be Okrulta's.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And we'll all have the choice pick of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield fought hard to keep his</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboring breath from giving him away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How he longed to throw himself into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open and send slugs into their rot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten bodies! But he couldn't do that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He must use discretion. Freedom was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to him now when he had boundless</seg><seg type="columnLine">duties resting upon his head. What he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had heard from these two evil lips fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bode a terrible disaster. He felt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white would assume the old regime,</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more, if they would be able to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the daughter of the high priest back</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he, Mansfield, was the only white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who knew of all! It behooved him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to move with sanity, with caution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The standing black moved toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. 'You stay here, Katka. I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">go over and see what the girl is do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. When Mantsi returns, you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And with another of those demonaical</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughs he quit the room. The remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">black rose from the lounge and moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">around. Presently he strode to the panel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and glared through it. Another cackle</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped from him. He seated himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the chair, behind which crouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mansfield.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was now or never! The scientist</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered his energy for one swift blow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Silently he removed his gun.and held it</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the barrel. He sprang up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung with all his might at the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">head which was turning startlingly; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">force almost tore the weapon from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. The fellow stiffened, sank for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a frenzied speed he raised the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy body and dragged it to the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">panel.

Another one dealt</seg><seg type="columnLine">with!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rushed toward the opening of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">draped cloth and peered out. An in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward rush of gladness rose within him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Proceeding along the long corridor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black who had said he was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to where Venia was!

The black</seg><seg type="columnLine">was swinging along in care-free</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion, utterly scornful of everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">but of his own importance. And Mans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field gave no cause for him to feel that</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone was following. He hugged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">20</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">walls like a dark shadow flitting in long</seg><seg type="columnLine">noiseless strides when he had the oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity, gliding along step by step when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other slowed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The corridor was a very long one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinuous and narrow. At one time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black came abreast of a portal and gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into it, looking absently backward, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Englishman was a silent posing fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure which blended perfectly with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surroundings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir John Mansfield was glad of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. He knew where the pit chamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">was situated. It struck him that he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, could withstand any number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">assailants there with his gun. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an excellent stand. He could pick them</seg><seg type="columnLine">off one by one as they came through.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Could pitch them into the gray matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The black stopped before a door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glided in.

In all</seg><seg type="columnLine">probability that was where Venia was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He couldn't jumble the whole thing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this momentous instant. He must not</seg><seg type="columnLine">let his chance slide through his fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His hand came in contact with a sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn in the wall and he squirmed silent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly around it. A dark cloth shrouded</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he presumed to be the door. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">imperceptible precision he drew it aside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A thin beam of light greeted him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The room was empty, and was in ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance similar to the one he had left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a moment he had slipped through,</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing statuesque, keen, eyes flitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">around. He heard loud voices and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped like a plummet behind a divan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cloth at the other end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room swished back and the black he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been following emerged in the company</seg><seg type="columnLine">of another.

He nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good! Then she will be taken to Ok-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rulla!" Again he heard that name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They laughed gleefully. With a fare-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well gesture one went to the entrance</seg><seg type="columnLine">and departed. The other chuckled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, flexed his arms and went into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Mansfield waited for a few</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">moments. It was clear to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Venia was in the next room. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the time to collect himself. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose from behind his concealment with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trembling heart. The girl was under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">going torture. That much he gleaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their conversation. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of the girl undergoing forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardship fired his brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sprang from his cover and</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched the weapon from its holster.

Mansfield halted, watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black who was applying his strength on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lever of some sort. The fellow pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing back; at the move there issued</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a large pipe in the ceiling a hissing</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound, like escaping compressed air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then he saw Venia.

Anything that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">delay the blacks from finding out what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had happened. His mind was on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing now. He couldn't save Venia at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment. He must take care of him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One good thing, though.

That would</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean instant discovery. It was a break</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him that the chamber of the man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eating matter was at the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long hallway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a flash he had sped across the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridor and into the chamber.

His right hand cupped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disgusting face and shoved back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Never had he fought like this!

It truly was miracu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lous that he hadn't broken something in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that short heavy fall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat up and rubbed his head. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">organ certainly had, of late, been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">recipient of plenty. But the faithful</seg><seg type="columnLine">old dependable still worked! His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were becoming accustomed to the dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of the room. He glanced upward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a short flight of steps lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down from the slab of stone through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had fallen. The unexpected-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the fall had caused them to abet</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than to hinder his sudden drop.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a wonder he hadn't broken half</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bones!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He laughed elatedly. Something real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly seemed to be taking care of him! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent a warm feeling rushing through</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. And he swept an eager eye around</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The glance startled him. The walls of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room were arrayed in narrow com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partments, and in each of the cell-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">three-sided affairs there stared unblink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly back at him the most hideous of</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces! It was a sight that almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked him off his feet!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He crouched with gun in hand ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectantly, waiting. But those fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful, cadaverous visages made no move</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him. Their horrid features were</seg><seg type="columnLine">so repellant that Mansfield stood rooted</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an inanimate statue. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't remain thus forever, so he</seg><seg type="columnLine">crept closer to the first stall. His weap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on was ready to fire and ready to kill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A glance inside, and he burst into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh that peeled off the ghastly feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing which had covered him during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">past few moments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They weren't live things! Only mask-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like effigies! He paced from cell to cell</seg><seg type="columnLine">and satisfied himself on that point.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Masks! But what forbidding depic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions! They were enough to make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood crawd within you, these uncanny,</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird faces! From every neck there</seg><seg type="columnLine">depended a long robe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield understood now what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were. Gaudy displays of a high priest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which herded superstitious and suscept-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible blacks into submission. And he, Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Mansfield, had the fortunate ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perience of falling directly into this! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckled to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were dozens of the gruesome</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces all around. Probably this cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber was entered only by the priest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With almost childish inquisitiveness he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped one of them over his head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">paraded around to acquire the feeling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Satisfaction dripped from him. Wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he told this to some of his col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leagues back in England! Here he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was attired in the regal garment of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">god! He could with a gesture decide</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fate of mankind! Ha! Ha!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He bolted upright suddenly. A voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to him faintly. In a bound he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in the cell, standing up, still garbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the robe with the ugly head. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just in time!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The slab of stone through which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fallen glided back and a black strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the steps! From within the beastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">mask Mansfield envisioned the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendid specimen of a body he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever seen. The negro was fully eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet tall if he was an inch. His shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders were like mountain tops charged</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a beauteous, graceful ripple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He walked directly to the cell in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Mansfield was concealed, gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">26</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">preoccupiedly into it! There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">frown upon the black face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That noise!" he murmured audibly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They think it is Ra!

His countenance was instilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hate, but it could be plainly seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was a reasoning power behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">that skull. He wasn't like the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the race, with negligible forehead, prog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nathous jaw. That fellow radiated a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fierce will and man power. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be an uncomely foe to deal with!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield ran to the door through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had gone and opened it sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reptitiously. He saw a large hollow</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell and it was empty. lie crept into</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and looked around. There sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">now the booming voice of Okrulla with</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinctness. He was speaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Men of the black race of Atlantis!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The time has come for us to destroy</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white devils and their power.

The shell was the inside of some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing which he couldn't shape out. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he struck it! It was the inside of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">altar, and near by there stretched back</seg><seg type="columnLine">the raised dais. The ceiling was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his head. He stood on the plat-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">form and looked through the narrow il-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminated slit. An exclamation hissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his lips!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was peering into a large chamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which there were many blacks. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">right next to him--only the thin wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">separated them--was Okrulla, in all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fineries of priesthood!

Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fanatics banged their heads with</seg><seg type="columnLine">violence. It brought a grin to the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the concealed man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something made Mansfield look at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun, and it was a lucky thing.

A vituperous stream of hatred</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heaped upon the heads of the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of Atlantis. He cursed them with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a frenzied joy that made the headdress</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiver.

He began a slithering dance upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dais, and presently the entire gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering was burst into song, an eerie, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">musical chant that pricked the nerves</seg><seg type="columnLine">with horror. Their faces were not hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man any more; jowls were slavering for</seg><seg type="columnLine">human blood, eyes were rolling to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the avid accompaniment of twitching</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Closer and closer came the dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">black.

The mouth of the priest opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">in surprise, only to be the recipient of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chunk of metal that tore clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his head. The sleek poniard</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped from his spasmodic fingers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell upon the palpitating bosom of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, hilt downward.

The hollow shell re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded to the echo of their feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the room of the robes Mansfield</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed the girl upon a soft lounge, tore</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the hideous thing he wore.

He curled himself up in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">silky robe and sat at the foot of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lounge in deep thought. Now that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the upper hand, he must devise</seg><seg type="columnLine">some means of getting out of there with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. He might be able to play this</seg><seg type="columnLine">role of Ra for a while, but the effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">would soon wear off amongst the blacks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That wouldn't last forever. And this</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun was his chief hold upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thing to do, he told himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, was to bend every effort to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the outlet of the underground hab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itat was. He realized that it would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a crafty approach. The minds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these fellows wouldn't understand if</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the great Ra suddenly asked them the</seg><seg type="columnLine">question. He must know everything!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he really knew little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he was glad now that Okrulla</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gone. Probably he had been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one who had ever gone into this</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. He would have immediately rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ognized that • mask robe which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn, would have known that some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one was resorting to trickery. And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been a deadly enemy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that knowledge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thinking, musing, Mansfield nodded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lay down at length for a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of relaxation. He needed it badly, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His whole body just yearned for a sweet</seg><seg type="columnLine">repose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some time later he awoke, feeling old</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength flowing back into his veins.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had been the first sleep he had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">since that impromptu one up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great Sphinx--and didn't it feel good!</seg><seg type="columnLine">His body clamored for a thing just like</seg><seg type="columnLine">this!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He moved to the shell and looked out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the slit. A smile broke over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. There was a great platter of food</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the altar. His orders were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed out to the word. The body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Okrulla had been taken out, too. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep silence pervaded the chamber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He removed the food and took it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inner chamber. He awoke Venia and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they ate in silence. Both ate famishedly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a contented sigh falling when they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">had enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Venia, we can't stay here. Our only</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to get out of this place is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get out among the blacks. We might</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear something which will show us. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't ask any questions. Come, don one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these robes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a good idea, she admitted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Staying here would lead them nowhere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was positive. He helped her put</seg><seg type="columnLine">on one of the robes, adjusting it so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it didn't drag on the ground, then dressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in the ugly garment as be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">30</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fore. Underneath the garment he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped securely the gun, ready to draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trigger finger back into the speech</seg><seg type="columnLine">of death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They went out of the shell, into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber of the many benches, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked slowly to the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Under no condition,-" whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mansfield, "must you get separated</seg><seg type="columnLine">from me. It is our only salvation. Keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">your eyes open. And I'll do all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking that must be done."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She nodded, the grotesque head bob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing up and down. They left the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance behind them and emerged into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long corridor. Several blacks were</seg><seg type="columnLine">lolling there and their eyes popped as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the godly creatures came out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber of rites. They fell upon their</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees in humble subjection. Others is-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sued from doorways and saw, too, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavenly beings going slowly along, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they responded also with obsequious</seg><seg type="columnLine">bows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE two moved along without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word, occasionally prying into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber. They paid little attention to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black men and women who flattened</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves out at their appearance. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on they promenaded. Then Mans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field caught a glimpse of the stairway</seg><seg type="columnLine">which led downward to the lower paths,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one he had rushed up ahead of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nudged the girl. "This might lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">us somewhere. I know there are lots</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blacks below. Might hear something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They started down. At one place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bend in the flight, he saw the cloth</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of the alcove through which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been catapulted. He couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">resist pulling it to one side and scruti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nizing the slab which moved inward to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the priest's sanctuary. In some manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">he must have exerted pressure upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right spot. It was a wonder the blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't discovered this before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down in the corridor beneath, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">found many blacks, and their sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance brought a hush which was an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered only by the lowering of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads. The great deity, Ra, was walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing amongst them! The supreme god</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all! The beastly visage adorning</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mansfield scowled ferociously, but inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">tliere was a smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They came to a doorway and Mans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field felt the arm on his side quiver</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a shudder. He gazed up askance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgetting that he couldn't read that in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">human face. Then he understood. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the torture chamber. Orientating his</seg><seg type="columnLine">position by it, he gazed down the length</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the passage and saw that the pit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror was down at the other end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield tried to figure this out. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood to reason that, if there were an</seg><seg type="columnLine">exit out of this place, it would be at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">high level and not down here--some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where at the highest elevation. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">where was that? In the labyrinth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridors it was a trying task to figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything out like this. He'd better get</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and search the upper passages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a shriek split his eardrums and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he whirled. The corridor was empty!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The girl had vanished! In some stealthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner Venia had disappeared. Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">that scream rent the atmosphere, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time it ceased suddenly, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the voice had been choked into silence!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Doomed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MANSFIELD cursed himself for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fool he was. Venia had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been right. The blacks were</seg><seg type="columnLine">never to be trusted. They were danger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous at all times. And he, the dupe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been, had been led on by their</seg><seg type="columnLine">silly demonstrations and had trusted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were believing him to be Ra. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time he had been drawing the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOST CITY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">31</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and himself closer and closer into their net.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was plain now. They were afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his gun. It was easy for them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know beneath which robe he was. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">artfully they stole the girl right from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his side. They had been afraid to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tamper with him. He spat death too</seg><seg type="columnLine">viciously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ra! These bestial minds accepted no</seg><seg type="columnLine">deity, he told himself scornfully. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be easily frightened, but only</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the moment. Nothing could sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jugate these brutes for any length of</seg><seg type="columnLine">time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The capture again of Venia had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened so spontaneously, that he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know where to turn for the moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He clutched his weapon with a fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip, swept the corridor about him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a swift scrutiny. It was bare of all life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, like a streak, he sped down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the passage to the chamber of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the circular pit of the man-eating gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was familiar ground he trod on</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. Not so very long before he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">scuttled down this very passage like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trapped beast and had succeeded in free-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing himself and coming out on top. Rut</seg><seg type="columnLine">now it was a different matter. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a lump in his throat at the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that scream which had suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped, at the thought of the danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl might be in now, and all due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his abominable carelessness. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be dead by this time. The black</seg><seg type="columnLine">devils were desperate. They wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">take chances any more. A defenseless</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl meant nothing to their crooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds. A prayer broke from his lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He flung aside the cloth from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ante-room of the pit of doom. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately he had his hands full.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were a half dozen blacks there</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed with clubs, apparently waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him. The moment he bounded into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room, they fell like a scourge upon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him. His gun barked once and the fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most black fell backward, stumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">into two who were right behind him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocking them both off their feet. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashing eyes of the scientist saw a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">club swing toward his head with crush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing intent. He tried to leap out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way but did not succeed. It crashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into him!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had Okrulla to thank for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">negligible damage the wooden club did.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The headdress was composed of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong material that made the club</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounce right up again and out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wielder's hands. The tight-fitting cap</seg><seg type="columnLine">of metal bore the full brunt of the blow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which hardly dazed the white man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MANSFIELD tore the robe away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his shoulders, freeing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">firing arm for better use. Once again</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun barked and another black</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitched to the ground. Two negroes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were now on the floor, one pawing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air and with distorted face--the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">flattened against the stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blacks were nerved to fight it</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to a finish. They wanted badly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rid themselves of this man with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">noisy thing in his hands, who still had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hideous head perched atop of him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But their very own eyes had seen what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had happened to two of them after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same number of loud cracks. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">disheartening to pile in against such an</seg><seg type="columnLine">incomprehensible factor of supernatural</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadliness, yet with cries of abandon</seg><seg type="columnLine">they flew at him, to get in a finishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow. Their shrieks of rage cluttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But this was what Mansfield liked</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. At close quarters he couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">miss hitting their bodies. The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing which might worry him was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gun would be emptied and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the blacks would rush in before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could refill the chambers. But that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a passing fear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">32</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blacks could stand no more of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it after two more of them crashed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground. They dashed for the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and plunged out head-first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield leaped over the fallen bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brought up against the panel. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift glance into it and a fearful cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst from his throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Venia!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl was lying on the slope, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers holding tightly to the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the narrow ledge. Her eyes were shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">with terror. Slowly she was slipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward, her white hands bleeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the fierce but impossible attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to clutch securely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the sound of his voice she looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at his grotesque head silhouetted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the opening, her lips trying to form</seg><seg type="columnLine">some word. But Mansfield didn't need</seg><seg type="columnLine">that word to see what she was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">through. He slammed the gun into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">holster and in the same motion was</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the panel--just as the girl let</seg><seg type="columnLine">go and commenced to slide down to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible death!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a twinkling he tore off his cumber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sham of a masked head and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast it out toward the center of the pit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he threw himself face downward</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the narrow ledge, and then gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">slid off the rim upon the decline, his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him ramming hard into the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yielding rock. He now let his upper part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the body sway slowly, carefully, rig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">idly, his arms stretched far out to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly sliding girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was skidding down and down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes were wide open to the attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Englishman. Her fingers kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace with her descent by rubbing per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiring lines in the slope. And then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to gain momentum!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MANSFIELD'S torso was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully out over the ledge; his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared unafraidly at the circular pit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which now looked so dreadfully close.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">With one hand braced under him, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot out the other to the girl and Venia,</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperation forcing her to her utmost</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stop the maddening glide, gave a sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den leap! If it failed, the next moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">would see her shoot down at a speedy</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace with but one end. But it was her</seg><seg type="columnLine">only chance!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her fingers fell into the outstretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">palm of Mansfield. The moment that</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleeding soft hand dropped into his,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vise encircled it. It stopped altogether</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fall of the girl, but it pulled him out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of position and he felt his feet give</seg><seg type="columnLine">way behind him. For a moment he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">positive that it was all over. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosened feet again held and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">secure with the girl in his strong grasp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But safety was far from being a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact! There remained yet the arduous</seg><seg type="columnLine">job of getting both of them out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">precarious position. Neither was in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape to move around without drastic</seg><seg type="columnLine">result.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield, thinking hard and fast, felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was only one thing to do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He'd lie like this and brace hard. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands he might be able to work the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl up and past and over him. In that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way she might be raised until her hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more reached the ledge and she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to get back upon it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quickly he outlined the plan to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she nodded briefly with understand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. His tense hands pulled her up inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">by inch until he was grasping her around</seg><seg type="columnLine">her waist; then she was able to move</seg><seg type="columnLine">up on her own power. Once she slid</seg><seg type="columnLine">back for a short distance, but he halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that immediately. Those steely muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">dug into her without regard; he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hurt her. In a short while the soles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her sandals flicked by his sight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard her laboring breath pant:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've got it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came two small but powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands wrapped around his ankles, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOST CITY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">33</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a jiffy he was back upon the ledge. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl dropped upon it in exhaustion, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vouring him with eyes full of thanks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her face was drawn with the suffer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing she had undergone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield made as though to sit down</seg><seg type="columnLine">next to her, when a blood-curdling yell</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from behind him.

A negro stood there, club in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, sneering at them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ra!

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart was trembling strangely.

Then he began,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are a friend of Dr. McClellan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a trusted diplomat in the service of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our government.

You shall be signally hon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ored, Mr. Hardy, for you shall be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very first to know of my discovery.

His voice dropped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost a whisper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have eliminated the need of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">microscope in entomological study!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">began. "Instead of peering through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass to magnify the insect, I have dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered the means of increasing the size</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the insect itself! I can study an insect</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a vivisectionist studies an animal! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have discovered the secret of insect</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardy's eyes widened perceptibly. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">man of Kingsley's standing would make</seg><seg type="columnLine">no idle boasts. He listened, scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">believing, yet forced to believe on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reputation of the man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can enlarge the insect," he added,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"many times--hundreds of times!

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">spider that spreads its hairy legs across</seg><seg type="columnLine">a boulevard! I have done it, Hardy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you are the first, except for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter, who has aided me in my ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periments, to know about it! Think--</seg><seg type="columnLine">40</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">think how simple it will be to study. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SOMETHING flashed across Hardy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind as he listened entranced to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">staccato-description of the mammoth</seg><seg type="columnLine">bugs. Was such a thing possible? If any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, other than so eminent a personage as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Kingsley, had told him of such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing he would have laughed it off as</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere nonsense. If this were true. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He clutched the professor's arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you sure that no one knows of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this?" he asked, almost fiercely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor assured him that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be made public for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">days yet--at least until a demonstration</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been given. But why this sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">agitation? What difference could it</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly make if some one did know</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pardon, Professor Kingsley," Hardy</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, apologetically. "The possibilities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your discovery quite overwhelmed me</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the moment. I believe that I see a</seg><seg type="columnLine">future for your discovery, that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely imagined. It is great! Stupen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dous! But it demands the utmost se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crecy for if what you describe is actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, civilization shall never forget you</seg><seg type="columnLine">as its greatest benefactor!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor was puzzled, the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke in circles. His languid frame had</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly taken on an abundance of en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ergy and he was clearly agitated about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the discovery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardy waxed serious. "Professor, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a member of the Diplomatic Service of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our Government, I beg that you keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">this discovery secret. It means more--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand times more--to humanity than</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the crops in the world! No one else</seg><seg type="columnLine">must learn of this until a later date.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt pleased, however, in the display of</seg><seg type="columnLine">importance attached to it, and pledged</seg><seg type="columnLine">his word of secrecy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now, Mr. Hardy, if you would</seg><seg type="columnLine">care to be my house guest for a week</seg><seg type="columnLine">or so, I shall be happy to demonstrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">that what I have told you is no boast or</seg><seg type="columnLine">exaggeration."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardy leaped at the proffered invita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FURTHER conversation was inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupted by the arrival of a young</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady accompanied by a man. The girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">was introduced by the professor as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter, Doris. The man, Albert</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blake, a member of the staff of the Bu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reau of Entomology, was known to both</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. He had been acting as a guide to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Kingsley, this being the girl's ini-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tial trip to the Capitol City.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We had been wondering what hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to you," Doris said, addressing her</seg><seg type="columnLine">father. "But Dr. McClellan told us where</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were, so we thought that you might</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to join us in our sight-seeing trip."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The professor declined graciously and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl, followed by Blake, strolled over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a large window, to better view the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene that spread before them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardy had been doing some rapid</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking. A new enthusiasm filled him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had an idea. It was different. Radi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal, drastic. But he was certain that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be effective--if only that which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the professor had described to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved to be an actual fact! He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">studying Blake. He might fit perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the plan. Hardy spoke quietly to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I might impose upon your hospi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tality," he said, "May I ask that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young entomologist, Blake, be invited to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attend the demonstration at your home?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">PEACE WEAPONS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">41</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor was visibly puzzled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">this request. It was only a few minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">before that he had sworn him to secrecy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now he asked that a subordinate of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Bureau witness the demonstration.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If he had asked that McClellan attend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might be understandable, but Blake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">... He assured Hardy, however, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man would be entirely welcome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardy extended the invitation to Blake</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he accepted with an alacrity that</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his sidelong glance toward the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of meaning. Her face beamed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cordial welcome. Questions of how he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might secure leave of absence from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bureau were solved by the assurances of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the diplomat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardy made it his business, that eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning, to locate Blake at his home. There,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the privacy of his room, Hardy spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the young man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are no doubt puzzled regarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reason for this invitation to the home</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Professor Kingsley," Hardy began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blake had been more than puzzled. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">man of the standing of Morton Hardy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ask his company on a trip to the home</seg><seg type="columnLine">of so eminent a scientist as Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kingsley? It was beyond understanding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I didn't come to tell you. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">came here this evening, Blake, to deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine whether my judgment that you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">a young man of ambition and foresight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ideal, is correct. If I am wrong, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">invitation is cancelled."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blake peered at the man intently. Thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">far, his conversation had been most mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious. There was no reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, I am sure that my judgment is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not in error," Hardy hastened to add.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Your record at the Bureau is most</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfactory--you see I have been looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">you up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We leave to-morrow for the home of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Kingsley, a farm situated</seg><seg type="columnLine">about 50 miles from Boise, Idaho. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">before we go, I want to have an earnest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">talk with you. This trip, Blake, may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beginning of the greatest chapter in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the history of mankind! We are going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to watch Professor Kingsley conduct an</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment--an experiment such as no</seg><seg type="columnLine">being has ever witnessed before! I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">not tell you what is its object, for, if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a success, you shall know of it; if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a failure, just charge this trip up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pleasant vacation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardy paused. The quizzical expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion that held Blake's features had seem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly frozen to his face.

From a nearby incubator, he drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">an insect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just a common black ant," he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared, "which I shall place in this small</seg><seg type="columnLine">cardboard box."

Care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully measuring three drops of a final</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid, he breathed a sigh of satisfac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. He held the crystal-clear fluid up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here it is, gentlemen," the professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">proclaimed as he looked up at the tube</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost worshipfully. "The elixir of mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nification !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He picked up a medicine-dropper and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully drew part of the contents of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tube. Without speaking, he signalled</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the two men to draw closer to wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness the procedure. He removed the lid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cardboard box disclosing the ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched in a corner, slowly waving its</seg><seg type="columnLine">antenna, as if sensing some possible dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger. Bringing the dropper close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">insect he carelessly dropped a portion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fluid directly upon it. It squirmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment, then lay sill. The professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">replaced the lid of the box and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to his guests.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A growth gland is affected," the sci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">entist explained.

It was calmly nib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling a near by bush that its huge, scythe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like mandibles had cut down with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of a reaper!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no time to be lost! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">called to Blake.

Fearlessly it turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">face each of the men, in turn, as if un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided which might prove the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">worthy adversary. Its actions were light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning-swift. Its expressionless, multiple</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes gave no inkling of what plan it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be conjuring in its over-grown in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sect brain. Each man held himself tense</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ACTING under the Professor's com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mands, the men slowly closed in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, suddenly, with an incredible speed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant ant charged directly toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardy.

With a vicious click of its mandi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bles, the ant fairly pounced upon the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying him down beneath its almost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">crushing weight.

Only the blows</seg><seg type="columnLine">being rained upon it by Kingsley and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blake had distracted its attention suffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciently to delay his fatal contact with</seg><seg type="columnLine">those flashing jaws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Concentrating their attack on the vital</seg><seg type="columnLine">and less-protected thorax of the insect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blake finally delivered a blow that al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most severed the head and brought a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulsive end to the offensive campaign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mammoth creature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With difficulty, the two men pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the still-quivering body of the insect off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unconscious Hardy and removed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the house. Bleeding profusely from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the superficial wounds inflicted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful appendages of the insect, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffering seriously from shock, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a week before he had recovered suffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciently to rise from bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But time had not been lost.

There no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained the slightest doubt regarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the potential possibilities of the Profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sor's discovery. Although the scientist had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not considered any further practical ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plication of his elixir than for the easier</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more detailed entomological study,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the daring plan, that Hardy outlined,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him gasp in astonishment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Professor, Blake and Doris were</seg><seg type="columnLine">called into the room where he lay propped</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in bed. That they should be called</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus together proclaimed the advent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some startling revelation--the imminent</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibility that perhaps now Hardy would</seg><seg type="columnLine">reveal the reason for his enthusiastic and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious interest in the Professor's dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shall soon be as well as ever," Hardy</seg><seg type="columnLine">began, slowly.

Just what four entomologists</seg><seg type="columnLine">could find, in this war-ridden country,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more than he could understand. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed them closely. Obviously, the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought to enter his mind was that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be spies--but that possibility was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon dismissed from his thoughts when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he peered into the contents of a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">leather case that the Professor carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">and opened upon request. The case,</seg><seg type="columnLine">divided into numerous compartments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a seething mass of insects--bugs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">every kind and species.

Seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a corner of the reception room, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist silently drew upon an unlighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe held tightly between his clenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth. His eyes dreamily surveyed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carpeted floor. His face bore an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression of grim indecision.

I have agreed to your plan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only because I have implicit confidence in</seg><seg type="columnLine">your ideal, but I must again warn you:</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the insects have been impregnated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it shall be too late to reconsider!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardy smiled. "Whatever the danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">involved, however great the risk may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, we must not falter now." He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the professor closely. "Remember,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing we may do can ever be as fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">or as cruel or as relentless as the war</seg><seg type="columnLine">now raging not many miles distant, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half-dozen fronts. After all, a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">poison to counteract a more deadly po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion is not to be despised!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardy picked up the Paris edition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the New York Herald that lay on a table</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the room.

Gas</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shrapnel had taken its toll. Hardy</seg><seg type="columnLine">read the account aloud. "And the war</seg><seg type="columnLine">is only beginning," he said.

Tomorrow must see our ambitions</seg><seg type="columnLine">well upon the road to realization!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blake and Doris went out later in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evening. They walked the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets of Paris for an hour, enthralled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the sights and not a little affected by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distinct atmosphere of war that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to saturate the very air. It moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blake, however, to voice a fear to Doris</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her safety in the undertaking planned</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the morrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you do not seem to realize the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extreme danger to which you will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposed," he declared, earnestly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she minimized the peril involved</seg><seg type="columnLine">and waived his concern for her safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I ought to make him stop this whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy idea," he suddenly exclaimed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotly. "Why, he has no right to ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you possibly sacrifice your life for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hopeless ideal."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she pacified him with the assur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance that she could well take care of her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self under such circumstances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What we shall do to-morrow is more</seg><seg type="columnLine">noble and less perilous than answering</seg><seg type="columnLine">a nation's call to arms," she answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply. "To desert our cause now would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be to shatter the hope of world peace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever! After this war, there shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">never be another--whether we carry out</seg><seg type="columnLine">our plan or not. But if our hopes are</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized, the permanent peace that will</seg><seg type="columnLine">ensue shall be under the banner of civi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lization--a banner that will be torn to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shreds if our plan fails!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blake silently concurred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor had remained in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room with Hardy that evening, care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully distributing the various species of</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects into a quantity of small boxes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">46</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">These were divided into four groups:</seg><seg type="columnLine">one for each of the men, and one for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Early the following morning, Hardy</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave final and explicit instructions to</seg><seg type="columnLine">each, together with a box of insects and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vial of the precious fluid concocted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the Professor. It was agreed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">all would return to the room in the hotel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as possible after the accomplish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of their designated tasks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Professor would accomplish his</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the program in Paris.

Blake would make</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way, as correspondent, to the front-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line trenches, arranged through Hardy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence. Doris, as a Y. M. C. A. hos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tess, was directed to the training camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the soldiers of the allied armies</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted preparatory to leaving for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front. The time set for execution of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan was ten o'clock that night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TEN o'clock chimed in a tower in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paris. Professor Milton Kingsley</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared vacantly at the crowds of people</seg><seg type="columnLine">that scurried along the brightly-lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">street that lay ten floors below. Slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">. . . hesitantly he turned from the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow to the table near by. A group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">small boxes were arranged neatly on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top. Mechanically, with steady hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he uncorked a bottle of clear liquid and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dipped a tiny nozzle into the fluid. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened one of the boxes. A mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants struggled to escape from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded quarters. He pressed the bulbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">nozzle in his hand, saturating the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sects, then replaced the lid. Another</seg><seg type="columnLine">small box was opened. Spiders clawed</seg><seg type="columnLine">madly for freedom. A stream from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument and the insects quieted. An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other box of bees, another of grass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoppers and finally a larger box of</seg><seg type="columnLine">caterpillars received the same treatment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Kingsley opened the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again looked out at the street below.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He hesitated only a moment and then,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with a sudden determination, threw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxes, singly through the window. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In Berlin, a large clock on the Library</seg><seg type="columnLine">Building indicated 10 o'clock. Morton</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardy jumped into a taxicab and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed the driver to travel slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the city. The saturated boxes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects were in a small case that he car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried. As the cab traversed the business</seg><seg type="columnLine">section of the German city, he threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tiny boxes upon the various streets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he proceeded to the railroad sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion where he boarded a train to a bor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering neutral country, and thence re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to Paris.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The radium-lighted hands of a watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the wrist of Albert Blake glowed ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock. No Man's Land seemed un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually quiet as he walked in nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">anticipation along the stretch of the first-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line trench. Even the soldiers, whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">he always believed to occupy the line</seg><seg type="columnLine">so fully, appeared peculiarly scarce. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked about this and was informed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was one of the "lulls" that occur</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually "just before the storm." "All</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hell will break loose by morning," his</seg><seg type="columnLine">informant prophesied. Little did he</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess how right he was, Blake thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Enfolded by the Stygian blackness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trench and a starless sky, he drew from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pockets four small boxes, a vial and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rubber-bulbed syringe. By the dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of a cigarette, he filled the syringe</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the contents of the vial and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully sprayed the contents of each</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the boxes with the fluid. Looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him lest some one suspect an</seg><seg type="columnLine">untoward act, he hesitantly clutched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxes, then swung them into the black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the battlefield. A motorcycle dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patch messenger took him back of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines for a train to Paris. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a Y.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">hourly call of the guard that "all's well,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">droned in her ears until sheer exhaus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion closed her eyes as she sank into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">near by chair in the Recreation Hall of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A grey, bleak dawn announced the ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent of day and with it came a stir of</seg><seg type="columnLine">activity.

Her first thought, with the wild-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed soldier bending over her was of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her anticipated fear--the insects! She</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran to a window and looked out. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight that met her eyes brought an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voluntary recoil of horror. A mammoth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">grasshopper, ten feet in length, waved</seg><seg type="columnLine">its hairy antenna as if amazed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new world that appeared before its huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">multiple eyes. In the distance several</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic ants were scurrying, in char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acteristic zig-zag course, across the clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Soldiers appeared from everywhere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunned by nightmarish monstrosities</seg><seg type="columnLine">that infested the camp. Everywhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">were insects--giant, horrible insects--</seg><seg type="columnLine">who calmly surveyed the amazed men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were prepared to do battle against</seg><seg type="columnLine">them with puny rifles and pin-like bay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onets. Mere bullets might well have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been feathers, for all the effect such</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of combat could accomplish. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel-coated pellets, crashing against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth, rounded armor-like shell of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects, richocheted as if contacting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel shell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Panic-stricken she fled from the hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a small adjoining room.

Outside, she saw men fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the insects with guns and hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">grenades, but the battle was a losing one</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the creatures steadily gained ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">against their puny assailants, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">even a definite recognition of advance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doris looked back into the little room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alone she faced the horrible sight: a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic head that pressed against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window glass while huge, horny mandi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bles tapped the pane.

Apparently unaware of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass obstruction, the creature decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter the interior of the building and</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a slight additional pressure of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, the glass gave way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">t</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE girl was stunned with fear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slowly, the shiny brown body of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrous insect forced its anterior sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion through the opening. Doris recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized it immediately as a huge beetle. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to escape, but to leave the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing now might be even more hazardous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">than to take her chances with the whims</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this huge bug, that now attempted an</seg><seg type="columnLine">entry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A calm realization suddenly replaced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mad fear that had possessed her. Bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter by far to attack the insect while</seg><seg type="columnLine">handicapped in forcing its way through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the narrow opening of the window, than</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wait for it to complete its entry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then attempt a hopeless defense against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the overwhelming power of the creature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Resolutely, she picked up a chair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitantly approached the repulsive head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hairy fore-legs of the beast. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">mustered courage and every ounce of</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength that she possessed she crashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chair against the armored head of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bug. It scarcely felt the blow--or,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except for a sharp click of its vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">mandibles, gave little notice of it. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it halted its attempted ingress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She watched its movements for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. It seemed as if it were stuck in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window--straddled across the sill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tts movements had become more force-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful and more convulsive. The sides of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building seemed to shake with its power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful efforts to free itself. The girl took ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage of the situation and rained blows</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it, but to no avail. It seemed far</seg><seg type="columnLine">more concerned in attempts to extricate</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, than in the girl's pigmy efforts</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kill it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door to the building suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst open. Doris paled as she waited</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for the brief second that seemed an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terminable age. She stood rooted as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited the anticipated entrance of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">other mammoth monster. A soldier</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashed in breathlessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Quick, into the cycle!" he cried. "I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">get you out of here.

Accordingly, a fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been built around the clearing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all were ordered within its circle. There,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the time being, the camp awaited</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gradual disappearance of the mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sters. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was an unusually quiet dawn on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Front Lines. Through the slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifting mist of night, a lookout peered</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously across the top of the trench.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He gasped suddenly and sat bolt up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, as if an electric current surged</seg><seg type="columnLine">through him, all unmindful of danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">from an enemy sniper.

Ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently the enemy, a bit more alert, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">already spied the myriads of huge, grue-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some insects that infested No Man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Land, and were now crawling aimlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all directions. Above came the drone</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flying creatures: bees, wasps, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flies!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The alarm was now ringing wildly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the French and English trenches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thousands of men poured from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">dug-out sleeping quarters, ready for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">anticipated early morning enemy raid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">PEACE WEAPONS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">49</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But no enemy raid would ever have</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck such fear and astonishment into</seg><seg type="columnLine">their opponents as did this sight. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready soldiers from the opposing trenches</seg><seg type="columnLine">had climbed over and engaged the ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifying things in battle. But even armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers were no match against the on-</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaught of the insects. The French and</seg><seg type="columnLine">English soldiers leaped into the unprece-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dented fray and with bullets, gas and</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid fire, the two opposing armies</seg><seg type="columnLine">united against the common foe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fear seemed to have been removed</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely from the creatures, for nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">affected them. The comparatively few,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that succumbed to the fire and the gas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were replaced by hundreds more to fill</seg><seg type="columnLine">their places. The insects were headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for both trenches; grasshoppers leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of feet into the barbed-wire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">severing it like thread with the uncanny</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength of their powerful legs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mandibles; ants, running with the speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of race-horses, sped through the line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men bowling them over like tin soldiers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slashing with their scythe-like mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces; repulsive spiders pounced upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the helpless wounded and bound them</seg><seg type="columnLine">immovably in a silken web.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tanks were called into action, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">even these modern implements of war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fare seemed useless: a battle between a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tank and a mammoth beetle was only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle between Man's tank and Nature's,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the powerful charges of the gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">insect would bowl over the man-made</seg><seg type="columnLine">contrivances, rendering the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lethal gases only halted the ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tivity of the monsters temporarily for</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the return of clearer air, their at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacks and demeanor became as ferocious</seg><seg type="columnLine">as ever. Only hand-grenades seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to affect them, but even under this as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sault the wounds inflicted upon the giants</seg><seg type="columnLine">were seldom fatal ones. The plan to</seg><seg type="columnLine">utilize liquid fire brought results as far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as killing any insects that came in con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tact with the flaming hydrocarbon, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">this form of attack caused the bugs to</seg><seg type="columnLine">only flee before the fiery onslaught, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiring to a safer distance until this</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger had passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus the new battle continued for</seg><seg type="columnLine">days and nights; enemy soldiers forgot</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatreds for each other in the hatred for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this common menace, as they fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">side by side along the entire front. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects had spread for miles. Veritable</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of the gigantic creatures there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were; and with their appearance before</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new battle line, soldiers rose from</seg><seg type="columnLine">both trenches and took up arms in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">combined effort to stem the advance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this horrible army.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At near by airdomes, on both skies</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lines, aviators had not yet learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the menace that descended in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. A patrol had taken off early</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the morning, headed for enemy ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ritory. Five planes, in battle formation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">selected a three-thousand-foot altitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">for observatory purposes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T N the far distance a group of planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">A appeared headed toward the squad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ron. The leading plane, piloted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">commander, signaled to his accompany-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ships to prepare for action. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of the approaching fleet seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible. They traveled fully 200</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles per hour, the commander judged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He eyed them, still in the distance, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quisitively. Possibly the enemy had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped a new type of plane. Possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">. . . but wait, these were not planes!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. . .

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes were as much of a surprise to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the insects, apparently, as were the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sects to the pilots, for two had flown</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly into the blades of the whirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">propellers, killing the insects instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">50</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and crippling two planes now useless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Horror seized the pilots and observers</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ships as they recognized the mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster creatures. As if by a pre-deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined signal the wasps surrounded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two planes that had become disabled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">their contact with the other two insects.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Powerless, the ships began gliding to</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. Undaunted by the ill-success of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its fellow-creatures, other wasps leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the planes. Terror-stricken, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilots and observers abandoned the ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dropped like a plummet for fully a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet before pulling the rip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord of their parachutes, hoping thus to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape the flying horror. But as fast as</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity pulled, so fast did the wasps</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow the downward course of the four</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. With the opening of the chutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the flight arrested, the helpless men</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked agonizingly at the circling in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sects. Bullets from the pistols they car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried in a belt holster at their waist</seg><seg type="columnLine">were of little consequence. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a startling alacrity, one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasps pounced upon a pilot. A struggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">ensued but the paralyzing stinger of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">insect found its mark. Slowly the para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chute brought its unconscious burden to</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And in the sky, the battle continued:</seg><seg type="columnLine">three planes with machine guns, against</seg><seg type="columnLine">overwhelming odds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, in the distance, another fleet</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared. They were recognized as</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy planes. They were speeding into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fray. Immediately, the situation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sized up by the new arrivals, for they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had already been apprised of the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istence of the creatures. A "hand-to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand" combat ensued: plane against</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasp. It was a terrific battle. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">never was an enemy so defiant. To the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last insect, they fought. A few planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">had crashed with paralyzed pilots, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">because a few had "bailed out," prefer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring a long drop to earth before pulling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parachute trip cord, rather than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to face battle with such awful creatures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The battle over, the remaining planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed again into their squadron, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly wing-tip salute came from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy planes, and each returned to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own lines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT it was in Paris and in Berlin</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the major havoc was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrought by the insects. Already huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiders had spun gigantic webs between</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings and across streets. Men had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been caught in the snares and drawn into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greedy monsters' larders. Ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded into subways, looking upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subterranean railroads as ready-made</seg><seg type="columnLine">burrows, tearing, slashing and killing</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they went. Transportation w'as at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">standstill. Tanks from the battlefronts</seg><seg type="columnLine">warred upon the creatures who tore</seg><seg type="columnLine">down wires, wrecked buildings and held</seg><seg type="columnLine">the populace in a state of abject terror.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huge grasshoppers flitted across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities, halting only to strip trees of foli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age, or uproot choice shrubbery. Giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">bees seized upon a convenient building</seg><seg type="columnLine">and utilized the multi-storied edifice as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hive, sealing it with wax and honey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Food-warehouses were overrun with</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures who couldn't find enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat to fill their monstrous carcasses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colossal caterpillers drew their tremen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dous bulks into hotel lobbies and gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupidly at the terror-stricken people</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had sought refuge inside. Enor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous, repulsive flies, carrion eaters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the insect world, proceeded to feast</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon vanquished men and dead insects</seg><seg type="columnLine">alike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SLOWLY, the creatures spread into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smaller cities and towns and</seg><seg type="columnLine">villages of France and Germany. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the winged creatures had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">made their way across the channel into</seg><seg type="columnLine">England. Other insects descended into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Austria and even into Italy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The terror continued for more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">PEACE WEAPONS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">51</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a month. Thousands of people had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been killed or had died as a result of</seg><seg type="columnLine">insect attacks or of starvation when food</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplies had been entirely cut off. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europe was demoralized by the on-</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaught. Fighting between men had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased; all implements of war was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrated upon this new foe--the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly, normalcy returned.

Scarcely two months had elapsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">since the advent of the insects and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a single one lived. Those that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been annihilated by man, died natur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally at the expiration of their normally</seg><seg type="columnLine">allotted span of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doris Kingsley had made her way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hotel after several days, and she,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the three men, remained in Paris</seg><seg type="columnLine">as spectators of the horror they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberated. The crushing aggression of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the insects was far beyond the expecta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of either the Professor or of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardy, and, for a time, they feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had truly loosed upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world a terror that could easily exceed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ability of man to handle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardy spoke quietly and earnestly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Kingsley in the privacy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their rooms, late one afternoon. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">menace had passed from the immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate city, and the statesman's thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to his next move. Word had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come through the newspapers that sol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diers on the front-line trenches had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased their battling and were even fra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ternizing, following their fighting side</seg><seg type="columnLine">by side against the new enemy.

Taillefer was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first to fall, toppled from his horse by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sweep of a long-handled axe. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot-soldiers closed in on the chain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirted warriors surrounding King Har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">old.

The left wing swarmed across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trench and against the stockade</seg><seg type="columnLine">which sheltered the rest of the English</seg><seg type="columnLine">army, only to be brained by the clubs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rustics or cut down by their</seg><seg type="columnLine">scythes. The rear ranks pressed for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, climbing over the bodies of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">slain comrades. But the stubborn re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistance was too much for the attackers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who at last fell back, leaving a windrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dead before the English line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the return of the foot-soldiers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Norman knights spurred their steeds</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward in a thunderous charge.

Thrusting with lance and hewing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sword, they beat against the bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rier like waves against a cliff. Axe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear, scythe and sickle struck back at</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, shearing down horse and rider,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they, too, were forced to with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From time to time Carteret shifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the view back to the mound of Telham,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where William sat on his horse, scan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning the field of battle, surrounded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small group of knights, among them</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lammot de Carteret. Finally Whitman</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared his throat and commented</seg><seg type="columnLine">suavely:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sir Lammot appears to have defi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nitely aligned himself with the home</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quite naturally he belonged to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">select group chosen by the Duke as</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bodyguard."

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows on the battlefield shortened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and began to point eastward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hours passed unnoticed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchers in the laboratory, who sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">enthralled by the spectacle, silent except</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an occasional sharp ejaculation at</seg><seg type="columnLine">some particularly thrilling episode--hear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in fancy the trampling of the horses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clash of arms, the shouts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">combatants, and the groans of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying. On the English right, the Bre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton troops composing the left wing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">William's forces, became entangled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the marshes.

William held up a hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the rider spurred past and dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. Two mounted knights blocked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">path and grasped the bridle of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse. The Duke strode back and faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Panic-stricken, de Carteret struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">out viciously with his mailed fist, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next moment was dragged down by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enraged commander, who vaulted</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the saddle and, with a gesture to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captors of de Carteret, turned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to the conflict. The pair seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rebellious knight; a short, fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle ensued, and he was subdued</seg><seg type="columnLine">and led away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Whitman's laugh now was mocking--</seg><seg type="columnLine">malicious.

Can they be an ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phant's?" asked Sir John.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," replied Mokoum, "and, unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am mistaken, of a male full-grown."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eagerly, then, was the engagement</seg><seg type="columnLine">made for the following day. Sir John's</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse, as they returned, carried the harris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bucks. These fine creatures, so rarely</seg><seg type="columnLine">captured, excited the admiration of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole caravan, and all congratulated Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">John, except perhaps Matthew Strux,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who knew little of animals, except the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great Bear, the Centaur, Pegasus, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other celestial fauna.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At four o'clock the next morning, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunters, attended by their dogs, were al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready hidden in the underwood. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had discovered by new footmarks that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the elephants came in a troop to drink</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the pool. Their grooved rifles carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive bullets. Silent and still, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched for about half-an-hour, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they observed a movement in the grove,</seg><seg type="columnLine">about fifty paces from the pool. Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">John seized his gun. but the bushman</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him a sign to restrain his impa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tience. Soon large shadows appeared: the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickets rustled under the violence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some pressure; the brushwood snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crackled, and the sound of loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing was audible through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches. It was the herd of elephants.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Half a dozen gigantic creatures, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">as large as those of India, advanced slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly toward the pool. The increasing day-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light allowed Sir John, struck with ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">110</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">miration, to notice especially a male of</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous size. His colossal proportions</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared in the partial light even greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">than they really were. While his trunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">was extended above the underwood, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his curved tusks he struck the great stems,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which groaned under the shock. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushman leant down close to Sir John's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear, and whispered:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will he suit you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir John made a sign of affirmation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then," said Mokoum, "we will sepa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate him from the rest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this instant, the elephants reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the pool, and their spongy</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet sank into the soft mud. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">pumped up the water w'ith their trunks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and poured it into their throats with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">loud gurgling. The great male looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneasily about him, and seemed to scent</seg><seg type="columnLine">some approaching danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the bushman gave a peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry. The dogs barking furiously, darted</seg><seg type="columnLine">from concealment, and rushed toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">herd. At the same moment Mokoum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">charging his companion to remain where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was, went off on his zebra to inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept the elephant's retreat. The animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">made no attempt to take flight, and Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">John, with his finger on the lock of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle, watched him closely. The brute</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat the trees, and lashed his tail furi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously, showing signs not of uneasiness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but of anger. Now, for the first time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">catching sight of his enemy, he rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir John was about sixty paces distant;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crackled, and the sound of loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty paces, he aimed at his flank and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired. But a movement of the horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his aim unsteady, and the ball only</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the soft flesh without meeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">any obstacle sufficient to make it ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plode.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The enraged beast increased its pace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was rather a rapid walk than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">run, and would have soon distanced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse. Sir John's horse reared, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed from the thicket, his master un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to hold him in. The elephant fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed, ears erect, and bellowing like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trumpet. Sir John, thus carried away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">held on to his horse tightly with his knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">and endeavored to slip a cartridge into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chamber of his rifle. Still the ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phant gained on him. They were soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the wood, and out on the plain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir John vigorously used his spurs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two dogs rushed panting in the rear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The elephant was not two lengths be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind. Sir John could hear the hissing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his trunk, and almost feel his strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath. Every moment he expected to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be dragged from his saddle by the living</seg><seg type="columnLine">lasso. All at once the horse sunk on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind-quarters, struck by the elephant on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his haunches. He neighed, and sprung</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one side, thus saving Sir John. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephant, unable to check his course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed on, and sweeping the ground with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his trunk, caught up one of the dogs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shook it in the air with tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">violence. No resource remained except</seg><seg type="columnLine">to re-enter the wood, and the horse's in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinct carried him thither. The elephant</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued to give chase, brandishing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlucky dog, whose head he smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a sycamore as he rushed into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest. The horse darted into a dense</seg><seg type="columnLine">thicket entangled with prickly creepers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir John, torn and bleeding, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an instant discomposed, turned round,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shouldering his rifle, took aim at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephant close to the shoulder, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the net-work of creepers. The ball ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploded as it struck the bone. The animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered, and almost at the same mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment a second shot from the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood struck his left flank. He fell on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knees near a little pool, half hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the grass. There, pumping up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water with his trunk, he began to wash</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wounds, uttering plaintive cries. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushman now' appeared shouting, "He is</seg><seg type="columnLine">ours, he is ours!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">MEASURING A MERIDIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">111</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And in truth the animal was mortally</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded. He groaned piteously, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathed hard. His tail moved feebly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his trunk, fed from the pool of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood, poured back a crimson stream on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surrounding brushwood. Gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">his strength failed, and the great beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir John Murray now emerged from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grove. He was half naked, little of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hunting costume remaining but rags.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he felt as though he could have given</seg><seg type="columnLine">his very skin for this triumph.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A glorious fellow!" he exclaimed, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he examined the carcass; "but rather too</seg><seg type="columnLine">big to carry home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True, sir," answered Mokoum; "we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will cut him up on the spot, and carry off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the choice parts. Look at his magnificent</seg><seg type="columnLine">tusks! Twenty-five pounds a piece at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least! And ivory at five shilling a-pound</seg><seg type="columnLine">will mount up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus talking, the hunter proceeded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut up the animal. He took out the tusks</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his hatchet, and contented himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the feet and trunk, as choice mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sels with which to regale the members of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Commission. This operation took</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time, and he and his companion did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not get back to camp before midday. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushman had the elephant's feet cooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to the African method, that is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">burying them in a hole previously heated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an oven, with hot coals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The delicacy was fully appreciated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, not excepting the phlegmatic Palan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, and Sir John Murray received a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearty round of compliments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER X</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Rapids</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DURING their sojourn by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kraal, Colonel Everest and Mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thew Strux had been absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangers. On the eve of their departure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for their divided labors, they had cere-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                 S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">moniously taken leave one of the other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had not since met. The caravan</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued its northward route, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather being favorable, during the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten days two fresh triangles were meas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ured. The vast verdant wilderness was</seg><seg type="columnLine">intersected by streams flowing between</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows of the willow-like "karre-hout,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which the Bochjesmen make their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bows. Large tracts of desert land oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curred, where every trace of moisture</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared, leaving the soil utterly bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">but for the cropping-up occasionally of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those mucilaginous plants which no arid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity can kill. For miles there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural object that could be used for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">station, and consequently the astronom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers were obliged to erect artificial objects</seg><seg type="columnLine">for their point of sight. This caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable loss of time, but was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">attended with much real difficulty. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew of the Queen and Czar were em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ployed in this part of the work, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">performed their task well and rapidly;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the same jealousy, that divided their</seg><seg type="columnLine">chiefs, crept in sometimes among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seamen. Zorn and Emery did all they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could to neutralize any unpleasantness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the discussions sometimes took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious character. The Colonel ancl Strux</seg><seg type="columnLine">continually interfered in behalf of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">countrymen, whether they were right or</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong, but they only succeeded in mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing matters worse. After a while Zorn</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Emery were the only members of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the party who had preserved a perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">concord. Even Sir John Murray and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nicholas Palander (generally absorbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they were, the one in his calculations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other in his hunting), began to join</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day the dispute went so far that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strux said to the Colonel, ''You must</seg><seg type="columnLine">please to moderate your tone with</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomers from Poulkowa: remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was their telescope that showed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disc of Uranus is circular."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," replied the Colonel; "but ours</seg><seg type="columnLine">112</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">at Cambridge enabled us to classify the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nebula of Andromeda."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The irritation was evident, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">times seemed to imperil the fate of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">triangulation. Hitherto the discussions</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had no injurious effect, but perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather served to keep every operation</seg><seg type="columnLine">more scrupulously exact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON the .30th the weather suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed. In any other region a</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm and torrents of rain might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been expected: angry looking clouds cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the sky, and lightning, unaccom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panied by thunder, gleamed through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of vapor. But condensation did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not ensue--not a drop of rain fell upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thirsty soil. The sky remained over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast for some days, and the fog ren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered the points of sight invisible at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distance of a mile. The astronomers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, would not lose time, and deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined to set up lighted signals and work</seg><seg type="columnLine">at night. The bushman prudently ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vised caution, lest the electric lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">should attract the wild beasts too closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their quarters; and in fact, during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night, the yelp of the jackal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hoarse laugh of the hyena, like that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a drunken negro, could plainly be</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the midst of this clamor, in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roar of a lion could sometimes be</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinguished, the astronomers felt rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">distracted, and the measurements were</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken at least less rapidly, if not less</seg><seg type="columnLine">accurately. To take zenith distances</seg><seg type="columnLine">while gleaming eyes might be gazing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">them through the darkness, required im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perturbable composure and the utmost</seg><seg type="columnLine">sang-froid. But these qualities were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanting in the members of the Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission, and after a few days they re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained their presence of mind, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked away in the midst of the beasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">as calmly as if they were in their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">observatories. Armed hunters attended</seg><seg type="columnLine">them at every station, and no inconsider-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">able number of hyenas fell by their balls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir John thought this way of surveying</seg><seg type="columnLine">delightful, and while his eye was at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescope his hand was on his gun, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than once he made a shot in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervals between two observations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing occurred to check the steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress of the survey, so that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomers hoped before the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">June to measure a second degree of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meridian. On the 17th they found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">their path was crossed by an affluent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kuruman. The Europeans could</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily take their instruments across in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their india-rubber canoe; but Mokoum</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to take the caravan to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford which he remembered some miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">below. The river was about half a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide, and its rapid current, broken here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there by rocks and trunks of trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">embedded in the mud, offered consider-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able danger to any light craft. Matthew</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strux did not fail to represent this, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">finding that his companions did not re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coil from the attempt, he gave way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nicholas Palander alone was to ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">company the caravan in its detour. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too much absorbed in his calcula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions to give any thought to danger; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">his presence was not indispensable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his companions, and the boat would only</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold a limited number of passengers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Accordingly, he gave up his place to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Englishman of the crew of the Queen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Czar who would be more useful</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the circumstances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After making an arrangement to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the north of the rapid, the caravan</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared down the left bank of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream, leaving Colonel Everest, Strux,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emery, Zorn, $ir John, two sailors, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Bochjesman, who was the pioneer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the caravan, and had been recommended</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Mokoum as having much experience</seg><seg type="columnLine">in African rapids.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A pretty river," observed Zorn to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his friend, as the sailors were preparing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">MEASURING A MERIDIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">113</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ERY much so, but hard to cross,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered Emery. "These rapids</seg><seg type="columnLine">have not long to live, and therefore enjoy</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. With a few weeks of this dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">season there will hardly remain enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this swollen torrent to water a cara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">van. It is soon exhausted; such is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">law of nature, moral and physical. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">we must not waste time in moralizing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">See, the boat is equipped, and I am all</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiety to see her performances."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In a few minutes the boat was</seg><seg type="columnLine">launched beside a sloping bank of red</seg><seg type="columnLine">granite. Here, sheltered by a project-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing rock, the water quietly bathed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeds and creepers. The instruments</seg><seg type="columnLine">and provisions were put in the boat, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passengers seated themselves so as</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to interfere with the action of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddles. The Bochjesman took the helm;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he spoke but a few words of English,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and advised the travelers to keep a pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">found silence while they were crossing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The boat soon felt the influence of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">current. The sailors carefully obeyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">every order of the Bochjesman. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times they had to raise their paddles to</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoid some half-emerged stump; some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times to row hard across a whirlpool.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the current became too strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could only guide the light boat as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it drifted with the stream. The native,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiller in hand, sat watchful and motion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, prepared for every danger. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europeans w'ere half uneasy at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">novel situation; they seemed carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">away by an irresistible force. The Col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onel and Strux gazed at each other with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a word; Sir John, with his rifle be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween his knees, watched the numerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds that skimmed the water; and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two younger astronomers gazed with ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miration at the banks, past which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew with dizzy speed. The light boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon reached the true rapid, which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was necessary to cross obliquely. At a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word from the Bochjesman. the sailors</seg><seg type="columnLine">put forth their strength; but, despite all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">their efforts they were carried down</seg><seg type="columnLine">parallel to the banks. The tiller and</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddles had no longer any effect, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation became really perilous; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock or stump of a tree would inevitably</seg><seg type="columnLine">have overturned the boat. In spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the manifest peril, no one uttered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word. The Bochjesman half rose, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the direction which he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">control. Two hundred yards distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose an islet of stones and trees, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was impossible to avoid. In a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds the boat apparently must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost; but the shock came with less vio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence than had seemed inevitable. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat lurched and shipped a little water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the passengers kept their places.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were astonished to observe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">what they had presumed to be a rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">had moved, and was plunging about in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rush of the waters. It was an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense hippopotamus, ten feet long, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been carried by the current against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the islet, and dared not venture out</seg><seg type="columnLine">again into the rapid. Feeling the shock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he raised and shook his head, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him with his strange, dull eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with his mouth wide open, show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his great canine teeth. He rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">furiously on the boat, which he threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened to bite to pieces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Sir John Murray's presence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind did not forsake him.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">district, lying considerably lower than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of the plain, was moist and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fertile.

Notwithstanding its</seg><seg type="columnLine">fertility, the country appeared little fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quented by the wandering tribes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a kraal or a camp-fire was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen; yet water was abundant, forming</seg><seg type="columnLine">some considerable streams and lagoons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The astronomers halted to await the</seg><seg type="columnLine">caravan.

For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of the day the rivals kept apart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Sir John passed his time in beating</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surrounding woods. He failed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">finding any large game, but from a nat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uralist's point of view he ought to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been satisfied, since he brought down</seg><seg type="columnLine">two fine specimens of African birds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One was a kind of partridge, a francolin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirteen inches long, with short legs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark gray back, red beak and claws,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and elegant wings, shaded with brown.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The other bird, with a red throat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">white tail, was a species of falcon.

Some wild howls were</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard, by no means reassuring. Hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed in arguing about Palander, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">discussing plans for his assistance. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">English showed as much devotion as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strux could desire; and it was decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">that all work should be adjourned till</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Russian was found, alive or dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a weary night the day dawned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The horses were saddled, and the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">troop again followed the dog. Toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the northeast they arrived at a district</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost swampy in its character. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">small water courses increased in num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber, but they were easily forded, care</seg><seg type="columnLine">being taken to avoid the crocodiles, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Sir John, for the first time in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, now saw some specimens. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushman would not permit that time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">should be wasted in any attack upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reptiles, and restrained Sir John, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was always on the qui-vive to discharge</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ball. Whenever a crocodile, snapping</seg><seg type="columnLine">its prey with its formidable jaw, put</seg><seg type="columnLine">its head out of water, the horses set off</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a gallop to escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The troop of riders went on over</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods, plains, and marshes, noting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most insignificant tokens; here a broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">bough; there a freshly-trodden tuft of</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass; or farther on some inexplicable</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark; but no trace of Palander.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they had advanced ten miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">north of the last encampment, and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to turn southeast, the dog suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave signs of agitation. He barked, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an excited way wagged his tail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sniffing the dry grass, he ran on a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps, and returned to the same spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The dog scents something," ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed the bushman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It seems," said Sir John, "he is on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a right track.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog was certainly on the right track now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only question was whether Pal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ander was alive or dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few minutes the yelping ceased,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the bushman and Sir John, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in advance, were becoming uneasy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when suddenly the barking began again</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the forest, about half a mile away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The horses were spurred in that direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. and soon reached the confines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">MEASURING A MERIDIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">117</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the marsh.

Coming across a herd of</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty, but so wild that they could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">approach within 500 yards, they suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded in detaching a female from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">herd. The animal set off at first at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow trot, allowing the horsemen to gain</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon her; but when she found them</seg><seg type="columnLine">near, she twisted her tail, and started at</seg><seg type="columnLine">full speed. The hunters followed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">about two miles, when a ball from Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">John's rifle threw her on to her side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made her an easy victim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the course of the next night the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two Russians took some altitudes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars, which enabled them to determine</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latitude of the encampment. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">following night was clear and dry, with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out moon and stars, and the observers</seg><seg type="columnLine">impatiently watched for the appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the electric light. Strux, Palander,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Sir John relieved guard at the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope, but no light appeared. They con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded that the ascent of the mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">had offered serious difficulty, and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">postponed their observations till the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. Great, however, was their sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise, when, about two o'clock in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon, Colonel Everest and his com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">panions suddenly reappeared in camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In answer to inquiries whether he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the mountain inaccessible, Colonel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everest replied that although in itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountain was entirely accessible, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so guarded that they had found it</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary to come back for reinforce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you mean," said Sir John, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the natives were assembled in force?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, natives with four paws and thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">manes, who have eaten up one of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Colonel went on to say that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain was only to be approached by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spur on the southwest side. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow defile leading to the spur a troop</seg><seg type="columnLine">of lions had taken up their abode. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had endeavored to dislodge, but, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficiently armed, he was compelled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat a retreat, after losing one of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses by a single blow of a lion's paw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE recital kindled the interest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir John and the bushman. Clearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a station worth conquering, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">an expedition was at once arranged. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Europeans, without exception, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager to join, but it was necessary that</seg><seg type="columnLine">some should remain at the camp to</seg><seg type="columnLine">measure the angles at the base of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">triangle, therefore the Colonel resolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stay behind with Strux and Palander,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Sir John, Emery, and Zorn (to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose entreaties their chiefs had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">obliged to yield), Mokoum, and three</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives on whose courage he could rely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made up the party for the attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They started at four in the after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon. and by nine were within two miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mountain. Here they dismounted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made their ararngements for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. No fire was kindled, Mokoum</seg><seg type="columnLine">being unwilling to provoke a nocturnal</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack from the animals, which he wished</seg><seg type="columnLine">to meet by daylight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Throughout the night the roar of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions could almost incessantly be heard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">MEASURING A MERIDIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">119</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Not one of the hunters slept for so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as an hour, and Mokoum took ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage of their wakefulness to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">them some advice from his own experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''From what Colonel Everest tells us,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said calmly, "these are black-maned</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions, the fiercest and most dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">species of any. They rush for a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance of sixteen to twenty paces, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should advise you to avoid their first</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound. Should the first fail, they rarely</seg><seg type="columnLine">take a second. We will attack them as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they re-enter their den at daybreak;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are always less fierce when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are well filled. But they will defend</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves well, for here, in this unin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">habited district, they are unusually fero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious. Measure your distance well before</seg><seg type="columnLine">you fire; let the animal approach, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">take a sure aim near the shoulder. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">must leave our horses behind; the sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a lion terrifies them, and therefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">the safety of their rider is imperiled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We must fight on foot, and I rely on</seg><seg type="columnLine">your calmness."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All listened with silent attention:</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mokoum was now the patient hunter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Although the lion seldom attacks a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">without provocation, yet his fury, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">once aroused, is terrible; and therefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bushman enjoined composure on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions, especially Sir John, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was often carried away by his boldness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shoot at a lion," said Mokoum, "as</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly as if you were shooting a par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tridge."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At four o'clock, only a few red streaks</seg><seg type="columnLine">being visible in the far east, the hunters</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied up their horses securely and left</seg><seg type="columnLine">their halting-place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Examine your guns, and be careful</seg><seg type="columnLine">that your cartridges are in good trim,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued Mokoum, to those who carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifles; for the three natives were armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">otherwise, satisfied with their bows of</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloe, which already had rendered them</seg><seg type="columnLine">good service.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The party, in a compact group, turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the defile, which had been par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tially reconnoitered the evening before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They crept, like Red Indians, silently</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the trees, and soon reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow gorge which formed the entrance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here, winding between piles of granite,</seg><seg type="columnLine">began the path leading to the first slopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the spur.

In the event</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lions having returned to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">den and being at repose, it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to make short work of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER about a quarter of an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hunters, reaching the landslide</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the cave to which Zorn had di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">120</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rected them, crouched down and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amined the spot. It seemed a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">excavation, though at present they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly estimate the size. The entrance</seg><seg type="columnLine">was marked by piles of bones and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mains of animals, demonstrating, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond doubt, that it was the lions' retreat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Contrary to the hunter's expectation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cave seemed deserted. He crept to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entrance and satisfied himself that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was really empty. Calling his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions, who joined him immediately,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our game has not returned, Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">John, but it will not be long: I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had better install ourselves in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">place.

Repeating their</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrutiny, lest they should be mistaken</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to the cave being empty, they has-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened to barricade the entrance by piling</seg><seg type="columnLine">up stones, the intervening spaces being</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with boughs and dry brushwood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This only occupied a few minutes, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth of the cave being comparatively</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow. They then went behind their</seg><seg type="columnLine">loopholes, and awaited their prey, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not long in coming. A lion and</seg><seg type="columnLine">two lionesses approached within a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred yards of the cave! The lion, toss-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his mane and sweeping the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'ith his tail, carried in his teeth an</seg><seg type="columnLine">antelope, which he shook with as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease as a cat would a mouse. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">lionesses frisked along at his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir John afterwards confessed that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a moment of no little trepidation ;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt his pulses beat fast, and was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious of something like fear, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was soon himself again. His two com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions retained their composure un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the sight of the barricade, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts paused. They were within sixty</seg><seg type="columnLine">paces. With a harsh roar from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion, they all rushed into the thicket on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right, a little below the spot where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hunters had first stopped. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">tawny backs and gleaming eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinctly visible through the foliage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The partridges are there," whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir John; "let us each take one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," answered Mokoum softly, "the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brood is not all here, and the report of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gun would frighten the rest. Bochjes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, are you sure of your arrow at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Mokoum," said the native.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then aim at the male's left flank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pierce his heart."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Bochjesman bent his bow, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arrow whistled through the brush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood. With a loud roar, the lion made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bound and fell.

Attracted by their roar, two other</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions and a third lioness appeared round</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner of the defile. Bristling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger, they looked twice their ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">size, and bounded forward with terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">roars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now for the rifles," cried the bush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, "we must shoot them on the wing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since they will not perch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The bushman took deliberate aim,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and one lion fell, as if i were paralyzed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The other, his paw broken by Sir John's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet, rushed towards the barricade, fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed by the infuriated lionesses. Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less the rifles could now be brought suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessfully to bear, the three animals would</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeed in entering their den.

One of the wads, falling on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry bushwood, had set it alight, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon a sheet of flames, fanned by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind, lay between the men and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts. The lions recoiled, but the hunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers would be suffocated if they remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they were. It was a terrible mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, but they dared not hesitate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come out! come out!" cried Mokoum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*TA HEY pushed aside the brushwood</seg><seg type="columnLine">1. with the butt ends of their guns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked down the stones, and, half</seg><seg type="columnLine">choked, leaped out of the cloud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The native and Sir John had hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">lime to collect their senses when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were both knocked over.

But just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the animal turned upon him, a ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the bushman arrested her, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting a bone, exploded in her body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At this instant Zorn, Emery, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two Bochjesmen appeared opportunely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although unsummoned, hastening up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">defile. Two lions and one lioness were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead; but two lionesses and the lion</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the broken paw were still suffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciently formidable.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">third lioness and the wounded lion</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounded over the young men's heads,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and amid a last salute of balls and ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows disappeared round the corner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the defile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir John uttered a loud hurrah.

But hours passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, and no light appeared.

The incidents of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lion-hunt were recounted, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">victors heartily congratulated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the morning Sir John; Emery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Zorn had proceeded to the summit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mountain, and had thence meas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ured the angular distance of a new sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion situated a few miles to the west of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meridian.

The general</seg><seg type="columnLine">health was good, and water could always</seg><seg type="columnLine">be found. Even the discussions between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Colonel and Strux were less violent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and each seemed to vie with the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">in zeal for success, when a local diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culty occurred which for a while hin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered the work and revived hostilities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the 11th of August. During</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night the caravan had passed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wooded country, and in the morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted before an immense forest extend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing beyond the horizon. Imposing masses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of foliage formed a verdant curtain</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was of indescribable beauty. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the "gounda," the "mosokoso," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "mokoumdon," a wood much sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">for shipbuilding; great ebony trees, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bark covering a perfectly black wood;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"bauhinias," with fiber of iron; "buch-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">neras," with their orange-colored flow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers ; magnificent "roodeblatts," with</seg><seg type="columnLine">whitish trunks, crowned with crimson</seg><seg type="columnLine">foliage, and thousands of "guaiacums,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">measuring fifteen feet in circumference.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was ever a murmur like that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surf on a sandy coast; it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind, which, passing across the branches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was calmed on the skirts of the forest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In answer to a question from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colonel, Mokoum said, "It is the forest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Rovouma."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is its size?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is about forty-five miles wide, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How shall we cross it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cross it we cannot,". said Mokoum.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There is but one resource: we must go</seg><seg type="columnLine">round either to the east or to the west."</seg><seg type="columnLine">At this intelligence the chiefs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">much perplexed. In the forest they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not establish stations; to pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">round would involve them in an addi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional series of perhaps ten auxiliary</seg><seg type="columnLine">triangles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">f TERE was a difficulty of no little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	* magnitude. Encamping in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shade of a magnificent grove about half</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mile from the forest, the astronomers</seg><seg type="columnLine">assembled in council. The question of</seg><seg type="columnLine">surveying across the mass of trees was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once set aside, and it now remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">to determine whether they should make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the circuit to the east or the west, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meridian passed as nearly as pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible through the center of the forest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On this point arose a violent discussion</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the Colonel and Strux. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">two rivals renewed their old animosity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the discussion ended in a serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">altercation. Their colleagues attempted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to interfere, but to no purpose. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Englishman wished to turn to the right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since that direction approached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">route taken by Dr. Livingstone in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">expedition to the Zambesi Falls, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country would on that account be more</seg><seg type="columnLine">MEASURING A MERIDIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">123</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">known and frequented. The Russian, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the contrary, insisted on going to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left, but apparently for no other reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">than to thwart the Colonel. The quarrel</seg><seg type="columnLine">went so far that a separation between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the members of the Commission seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">imminent. Zorn, Emery, Sir John, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palander withdrew and left their chiefs</seg><seg type="columnLine">to themselves. Such was their obstinacy</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it seemed as if the survey must con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinue from this point in two oblique</seg><seg type="columnLine">-eries of triangles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day passed away without any</seg><seg type="columnLine">econciliation, and the next morning Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">fohn, finding matters still in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition, proposed to Mokoum to beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">the neighborhood. Perhaps meanwhile</seg><seg type="columnLine">the astronomers would come to an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstanding; anyway, some fresh venison</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be despised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mokoum, always ready, whistled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dog Top, and the two hunters ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured several miles from the encamp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. The conversation naturally turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the subject of the difficulty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I expect," said the bushman, "we</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall be encamped some time here. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">two chiefs are like ill-paired oxen, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulls one way and the other another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the consequence is that .the wagons</seg><seg type="columnLine">make no headway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is all very sad," answered Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">John, "and looks like a separation. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">interests of science are compromised,</seg><seg type="columnLine">otherwise I should be indifferent to it</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. I should amuse myself with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun until the rivals made it up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you think they will make it up?</seg><seg type="columnLine">For my part, I am almost afraid that</seg><seg type="columnLine">our halt will be indefinitely prolonged."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I fear so, Mokoum," replied Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">John. "The matter is so trivial, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is no question of science. Our chiefs</seg><seg type="columnLine">would doubtless have yielded to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific argument, but they will never</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a concession in a pure matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinion. How unfortunate that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meridian happens to cross this forest!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hang the forest!" exclaimed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushman. "Don't let them stop your</seg><seg type="columnLine">measuring, if you want to measure. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can't see the good of your getting at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the length and breadth of the earth?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who will be any 'better off when every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing is reduced to feet and inches?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	should just like to think of the globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">as infinite; to measure it is to make it</seg><seg type="columnLine">small. No, Sir John, if I were to live</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever, I could never understand the</seg><seg type="columnLine">use of your operations."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir John could not help smiling. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had often debated the subject, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignorant child of nature could evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">not enter into the interest attached to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the survey. Whenever Sir John at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted to convince him, he answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">eloquently with arguments stamped with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a genuine naturalness, of which Sir John,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half savant and half hunter, could fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">appreciate the charm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus conversing, the hunters pursued</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rock-hares, the shrill-toned plovers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the partridges (with brown, yellow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">black plumage), and other small game.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Sir John had all the sport to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. The bushman seldom fired; he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pre-occupied. The quarrel between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two astronomers seemed to trouble him</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than it did his companion, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">variety of game hardly attracted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice. In truth there was an idea float-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through his brain, which, little by</seg><seg type="columnLine">little, tool, more definite form. Sir John</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard him talking to himself, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him as he quietly let the game</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass by, as engrossed as Palander him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. Two or three times in the course</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the day he drew near Sir John and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "So you really think that Colonel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everest and Mr. Strux will not come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to terms?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir John invariably replied that agree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment seemed unlikely, and that he feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would be a separation between</seg><seg type="columnLine">Englishmen and Russians. The last time</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mokoum received this answer he added:</seg><seg type="columnLine">124</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, you may be easy; I have found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a means to satisfy both the chiefs.

Sir John made</seg><seg type="columnLine">no further inquiries, but could not at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all guess how the bushman proposed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reunite the two adversaries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Towards evening the hunters returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to camp, and found matters even worse</seg><seg type="columnLine">than before. The oft-repeated inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vention of Zorn and Emery had been of</seg><seg type="columnLine">no avail, and the quarrel had now reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a height that reconciliation seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible. It appeared only too prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able that the survey would be continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">in two separate directions. The thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this was sorrowful to Emery and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zorn, who were- now so nearly hound</seg><seg type="columnLine">by mutual sympathy. Sir John guessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their thoughts, and was eager to reassure</seg><seg type="columnLine">them; but however much he was secretly</seg><seg type="columnLine">disposed to trust to the bushman, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">abstained from raising any hopes which</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be fallacious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Throughout the evening Mokoum did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not leave his ordinary occupations. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged the sentinels, and took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual precautions. Sir John began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that he had forgotten his promise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before going to rest he tried to sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colonel Everest, whom he found immov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably resolved that, unless Strux yielded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the English and Russians must part.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There are things," added the Colonel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a tone of decision, "that cannot be</seg><seg type="columnLine">borne; even from a colleague."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir John, very uneasy, retired to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed, and being fatigued with his day's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sport, was soon asleep. Towards eleven</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock he was suddenly aroused by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives running to and fro in the camp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He quickly rose, and found everyone on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their feet. The forest was on fire. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark night, against the black sky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the curtain of flame seemed to rise to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the zenith; and in this incredibly short</seg><seg type="columnLine">time the fire had extended for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir John looked at Mokoum, who,</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing near, made no answer to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance; but he at once understood. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire was designed to open a road through</seg><seg type="columnLine">that forest which had stood impervious</seg><seg type="columnLine">for ages. The wind, from the south,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was favorable. The air, rushing as from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blower, accelerated the conflagration,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and furnished an ever fresh supply of</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen. It animated the flames, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept the kindled branches burning like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a myriad brands. The scattered frag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments became new centers for fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">outbreaks of flame; the scene of the fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">became larger, and the heat grew in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense. The dead wood piled under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark foilage crackled, and ever and</seg><seg type="columnLine">anon louder reports and brighter light</seg><seg type="columnLine">told that the resinous trees were burn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing like torches. Then followed explo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions like cannonades, as the great trunks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ironwood burst asunder with a rever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beration as of bombs. The sky reflected</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glow, and the clouds carried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rosy glare Kgh aloft. Showers of sparks</seg><seg type="columnLine">emitted from the wreaths of smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">studded the heavens like red-hot stars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, on every side, were heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">howls, shieks, and bellowings of herds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bewildered hyenas, buffaloes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions; elephants rushed in every direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, like huge dark specters, and disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared beyond the horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fire continued throughout the fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing day and night; and when day</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke on the 14th a vast space, several</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles wide, had been opened across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest. A passage was now free for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meridian.

When the requisite</seg><seg type="columnLine">observations were complete, the caravan</seg><seg type="columnLine">set off acrosss the burnt forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The road was paved with embers. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil was still burning, and here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there smouldered stumps of trees, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hot steam rose around. In many places</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay the blackened carcasses of animals</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been unable to make their</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape.

Toward the middle of the day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, it was safely encamped at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foot of the hill. Here was a mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock which seemed to have been ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged by the hand of man. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of cromlech--a surprising erection</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find in that locality--resembling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">structures attributed to the Druids, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">which ever furnish fresh interest to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">archaeologist. The most credible sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestion was that it must be the remains</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some primitive African altar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two young astronomers and Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Murray wished to visit the fan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tastic construction, and. accompanied by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bushman, they ascended the slope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were not above twenty paces from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cromlech when a man, hitherto con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cealed behind one of the massy stones</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the base, appeared for a moment, and.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">descending the hill, stole quickly away</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a thicket that had been untouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the fire. The momentary glance was</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for the bushman. "A Makololo!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he cried, and rushed after the native.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir John followed, and both in vain</seg><seg type="columnLine">searched the wood. The native, knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the short paths, had escaped where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most experienced hunter could not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">traced him. When the incident was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated to Colonel Everest he sent for Mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">koum, and asked him who the man was?</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he was doing? and why he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed him?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is a Makololo, Colonel," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mokoum. "He belongs to one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">northern tribes that haunt the affluents</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Zambesi. Not only is he an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy of us Bochjesmen, but he is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunderer of all who venture into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country; he was spying us, and we shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">be lucky if we have not cause to regret</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we couldn't get hold of him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what have we to fear from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">band of robbers ?" asked the Colonel;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"are not our numbers sufficient to resist</seg><seg type="columnLine">them ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At present, yes," replied the bush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man !

Colonel Everest drew out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daily News for the 13th of May, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intention of reading aloud to his col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leagues. Scarcely had he glanced at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first leading article, when his brow</seg><seg type="columnLine">contracted, and the paper trembled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand. In a few moments he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered his usual composure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What does the paper say, Colonel?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Sir John.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is grave news, gentlemen," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Colonel, "that I have to communi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He kept the paper in his hand, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his colleagues waited eagerly for him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak. To the surprise of all he rose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, advancing to Matthew Strux. said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Before communicating the intelligence</seg><seg type="columnLine">MEASURING A MERIDIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">127</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">conveyed in this paper, I should wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make an observation to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am ready to hear anything you may</seg><seg type="columnLine">say," said Strux, much astonished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Colonel then said solemnly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Strux, hithero there has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">between us a rivalry more personal than</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific, which has rendered our co-</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation in the common cause some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what difficult. This, I believe is to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">attributed to the fact of their being two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us at the head of this expedition. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoid antagonism, there should be only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one chief to every enterprise. You agree</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me, do you not?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Strux bowed in assent. The Colonel</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "This position, unpleasant for each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, must, through recent circumstances,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now be changed. First, sir, let me say</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I esteem you highly, as your position</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the scientific world demands. I beg</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to believe that I regret all that has</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed between us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These words were uttered with great</seg><seg type="columnLine">dignity, even with pride. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">humiliation in the voluntary apology, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobly expressed, and neither Strux nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">his colleagues could guess his motive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps the Russian, not having the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same incentive, was not equally disposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to forget any personal resentment.

Without another word</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the astronomers joined hands as friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now you are friends," cried Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">John.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Alas! no," said the Colonel, dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Russian's hand; "henceforth we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies, separated by an abyss which</seg><seg type="columnLine">must keep us apart even on the territory</seg><seg type="columnLine">of science."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then turning to his colleagues, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">added:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Gentlemen, war is declared between</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">England and Russia.

The English, with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">allies the French and Turks, were fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing before Sebastopol, the Eastern ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was being submitted to the ordeal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a naval conflict on the Black Sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Colonel's words fell like a thun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derbolt. The English and Russians, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their strong sentiment of nationality,</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to their feet. Those three words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"War is declared," were enough. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no longer companions united in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a common labor, but already eyed one</seg><seg type="columnLine">another as avowed antagonists. Such is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the influence of these national duels on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heart of man. An instinctive im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulse had divided the Europeans--Nich-</seg><seg type="columnLine">olas Palander himself yielding to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling: Emery and Zorn alone regarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other with more of sadness than</seg><seg type="columnLine">animosity, and regretted that they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not shaken hands before Colonel Ever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est's communication. No further con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation ensued; exchanging bows. Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lish and Russians retired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This novel situation, although it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not interrupt the survey, would render</seg><seg type="columnLine">its continuation more difficult. For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest of its country, each party de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sired to pursue the operations; but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">measurements must be carried along two</seg><seg type="columnLine">different meridians.

Three had now to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">the work of six, and consequently the</seg><seg type="columnLine">survey advanced more slowly, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">attended with more fatigue; but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not the men to spare themselves;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desire that the Russians should not</seg><seg type="columnLine">surpass them in any way sustained them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in their task, to which they gave all</seg><seg type="columnLine">their time and thoughts. Emery had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">indulge in fewer reveries, and Sir John</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not so often spare his time for</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting. A new programme was drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, assigning to each astronomer his</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper share of the labor. Sir John</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Colonel undertook all observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, both in the sky and in the field;</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Emery replaced Palander as calcu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lator. All questions were decided in</seg><seg type="columnLine">common, and there was no longer any</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear that disagreement should arise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mokoum was still the guide and hunter</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the caravan. The English sailors, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed half the crew of the Queen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Czar, had of course, followed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">countrymen; and although the Russians</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in possession of the steam-vessel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the India-rubber boat, which was large</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for ordinary purposes, was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">property of the English. The provision-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagons were divided, thus impartially</seg><seg type="columnLine">ensuring the revictualing of each cara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">van. The natives likewise had to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">severed into two equal troops, not with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out some natural signs of displeasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their part; far from their own pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turages and water-courses, in a region</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabited by wandering tribes hostile to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tribes of the south, they could scarce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly be reconciled to the prospect of sepa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ration. But at length, by the help of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bushman and the pioneer, who told</seg><seg type="columnLine">them that the two detachments would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be comparatively a short distance apart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they consented to the arrangement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On leaving Kolobeng the English car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">avan re-entered the burnt forest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived at the cromlech which had served</seg><seg type="columnLine">for their last station. Operations were</seg><seg type="columnLine">resumed, and a large triangle carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">the observers at once ten or twelve miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the west of the old meridian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Six days later the auxiliary series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">triangles was finished, and Colonel Ever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est and his colleagues, after consulting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the maps, chose the new arc one</seg><seg type="columnLine">MEASURING A MERIDIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">129</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">degree west of the other, being 23° east</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the meridian of Greenwich. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not more than sixty miles from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Russians, but this distance put any col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lision between the two parties out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">question, so it was improbable that</seg><seg type="columnLine">their triangles would cross.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All through September the weather</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fine and clear. The country was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fertile and varied, but scantily populated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The forests, which were few, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken by wide, open tracts, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasional mounds occuring in the prai-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ries, made the district extremely favor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able for the observations. The region</seg><seg type="columnLine">was well provided with natural pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducts. The sweet scent of many of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flowers attracted swarms of scar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abaei, and more especially a kind of bee</seg><seg type="columnLine">as nearly as possible like the European,</seg><seg type="columnLine">depositing in clefts of rocks and holes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trees a white liquid honey with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicious flavor. Occasionally at night</seg><seg type="columnLine">large animals ventured near the camp;</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were giraffes, varieties of antelopes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hyenas, rhinoceroses, and elephants. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir John would not be distracted, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">resolutely discarded his rifle for his tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under these circumstances, Mokoum</seg><seg type="columnLine">and some of the natives became purvey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ors to the caravan, and Sir John had</seg><seg type="columnLine">some difficulty in restraining his excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment when he heard the report of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns. The bushman shot three prairie-</seg><seg type="columnLine">buffaloes, the bokolokolos of the Bechu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anas, formidable animals, with glossy</seg><seg type="columnLine">black skins, short strong legs, fierce eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and small heads crowned with thick black</seg><seg type="columnLine">horns. They were a welcome addition to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fresh venison which formed the or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinary fare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE natives prepared the buffalo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meat as the Indians of the north do</seg><seg type="columnLine">their pemmican. The Europeans watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">their proceedings with interest, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first with some repugnance. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh, after being cut into thin slices and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dried in the sun, was wrapped in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanned skin, and beaten with flails till</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was reduced to a powder. It was then</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed tightly into leathern sacks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">moistened with boiling tallowy suet col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lected from the animal itself. To this</seg><seg type="columnLine">they added some marrow and berries,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose saccharine matter modified the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nitrogenous elements of the meat. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">compound, after being mixed and beaten,</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed, when cold, a cake as hard as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stone. Mokoum, who considered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pemmican a national delicay, begged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomers to taste the preparation. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, they found it extremely unpala-</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, but, becoming accustomed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flavor, they soon learnt to partake of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with great relish. Highly nourishing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not at all likely to be tainted, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taining, moreover, its nutritive elements</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely compacted, this pemmican was</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly suited to meet the wants of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">caravan traveling in an unknow.* r~Mn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try. The bushman soon had several hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred pounds in reserve, and they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus secure from any immediate want.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Days and nights passed away in ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servations. Emery was always thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his friend, and deploring the fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had so suddenly severed the bond</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their friendship. He had no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sympathize with his admiration of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild characteristics of the scenery, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with something of Palander's enthusiasm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">found refuge in his calculations. Col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onel Everest was cold and calm as ever,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhibiting no interest in anything beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">his professional pursuits. As for Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">John, he suppressed his murmurs, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighed over the loss of his freedom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fortune, however, sometimes made</seg><seg type="columnLine">amends; for although he had no leisure</seg><seg type="columnLine">for hunting, the wild beasts occasionally</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the initative, and came near inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupting his observations. He then con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered defense legitimate, and rejoiced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be able to make the duties of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">130</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomer compatible with those of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day he had a serious encounter</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an old rhinoceros, which cost him</seg><seg type="columnLine">"rather dear." For some time the ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal had been prowling about the flanks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the caravan. By the blackness of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin Mokoum had recognized the "chu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curoo" (such is the native for this ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal) as a dangerous beast, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, more agile than the white specics,</seg><seg type="columnLine">often attacks man and beast without any</seg><seg type="columnLine">provocation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">On this day Sir John and Mokoum</seg><seg type="columnLine">had set off to reconnoiter a hill six miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, on which the Colonel wished to</seg><seg type="columnLine">establish an indicating post. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain foreboding, Sir John had brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rifle with conical shot instead of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary gun; for although the rhino-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceros had not been seen for two days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet he did not consider it advisable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">traverse unarmed an unknown country.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mokoum and his companions had al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready unsuccessfully chased the beast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which probably now had abandoned its</seg><seg type="columnLine">designs. There was no reason to regret</seg><seg type="columnLine">the precaution. The adventurers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the summit of the hill, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the base, close to a thicket, of no</seg><seg type="columnLine">large extent, appeared the chucuroo. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a formidable animal; his small eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparkled, and his horns planted firmly one</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the other on his bony nose, furn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished a most powerful weapon of attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE bushman caught sight of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, as he crouched about half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile distant in a grove of lentisk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sir John," he cried, "fortune favors</seg><seg type="columnLine">you; here is your chucuroo!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The rhinoceros!" exclaimed Sir John,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with kindling eyes, for he had never be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore been so near the animal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes; a magnificent beast, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems inclined to cut off our retreat,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the bushman. "Why he should at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack us I can hardly say; his tribe is not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">carnivorous; but anyway, there he is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we must hunt him out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is it possible for him to get up</seg><seg type="columnLine">here to us?" asked Sir John.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No; his legs are too short and thick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he will wait."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, let him wait," said Sir John;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and when we have examined this sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, we will try and get him out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they proceeded with their re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">connoitering, and chose a spot on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">to erect the indicating-post.

Their diminished</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers added to their fatigue, so that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">notwithstanding their zeal, they oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casionally had to recruit themselves by</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting for several days. The heat was</seg><seg type="columnLine">overpowering. October in lat. 24° S.</seg><seg type="columnLine">corresponds to April in the northern hem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isphere and for some hours after mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day work was impossible. The bush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was alone uneasy at the delay, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was aware that the arc was about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass through a singular region called a</seg><seg type="columnLine">"karroo," similar to that at the foot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Roggeveld mountains in Cape Col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ony. In the damp season this district</seg><seg type="columnLine">presents signs of the greatest fertility;</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a few days of rain the soil is</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered with a dense verdure; in a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">132</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">short time flowers and plants spring up</seg><seg type="columnLine">everywhere; pasturage increases, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">water-courses are formed; troops of an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telopes descend from the heights and</seg><seg type="columnLine">take possession of these unexpected</seg><seg type="columnLine">prairies. But this strange effort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature is of short duration. In a month,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or six weeks at most, all the moisture is</seg><seg type="columnLine">absorbed by the sun; the soil becomes</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardened, and chokes the fresh germs;</seg><seg type="columnLine">vegetation disappears in a few days;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the animals fly the region; and where</seg><seg type="columnLine">for awhile there was a rich fertility, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert again asserts its dominion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This karroo had to be crossed before</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching the permanent desert bordering</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Lake Ngami. The bushman was natu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rally eager to traverse this region before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the extreme aridity should have exhaust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed the springs. He explained his reasons</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Colonel, who perfectly understood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and promised to hurry on the work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without suffering its precision to be af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fected. Since, on account of the state</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the atmosphere, measuring was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">always practicable, the operations were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not infrequently retarded, and the bush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man became seriously concerned lest</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they reached the karroo its char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acter of fertility should have disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile the astronomers could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">fail to appreciate the magnificence</seg><seg type="columnLine">around. Never had they been in finer</seg><seg type="columnLine">country. In spite of the high tempera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, the stream kept up a constant fresh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, and thousands of flocks would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">found inexhaustible pasturage. Clumps</seg><seg type="columnLine">of luxuriant trees rose here and there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving the prospect at times the appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance of an English park.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Colonel Everest was comparatively in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">different to these beauties, but the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">were fully alive to the romantic aspect</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this temporary relief to the African</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserts. Emery now especially regretted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the alienation of his friend Zorn, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">often thought both would have delighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the charming scenery around them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The advance of the caravan was en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">livened by the movements as well as by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the song-notes of a variety of birds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some of these birds were edible, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunters shot some brace of "korans," a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of bustard peculiar to the South</seg><seg type="columnLine">African plains, and some "dikkops,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose flesh is very delicate eating. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were frequently followed by voracious</seg><seg type="columnLine">crows, instinctively seeking to avert at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention from their eggs in their nests of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand. In addition to these, blue cranes</seg><seg type="columnLine">with white throats, red flamingoes, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames in the thinly scattered brushwood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">herons, curlews, snipes, "kalas," often</seg><seg type="columnLine">perching on a buffalo's neck, plovers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ibises, which might have flown from some</seg><seg type="columnLine">hieroglyphic obelisk, hundreds of enor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous pelicans flying in file--all were</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed to find congenial habitats in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">district, where man alone is the strang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er. But of all the varieties of the feath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered race, the most noticeable was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingenious weaver-bird, whose green nests,</seg><seg type="columnLine">woven with rushes and blades of grass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung like immense pears from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches of the willows. Emery, taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">them for a new species of fruit, gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">one or two, and was much surprised to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear them twitter like sparrows. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed some excuse for the ancient trav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">elers in Africa, who reported that cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain trees in the country bore fruit pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducing living birds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The karroo was reached while still it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lovely in its verdure. Gnus, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their pointed hoofs, caamas, elands, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazelles abounded. Sir John could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">resist the temptation to obtain two days'</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave from the Colonel, which he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voted with all his energy to his favorite</seg><seg type="columnLine">pastime. Under the guidance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushman, while Emery accompanied as</seg><seg type="columnLine">an amateur, he obtained many a success</seg><seg type="columnLine">to inscribe in his journal, and many a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trophy to carry back to his Highland</seg><seg type="columnLine">home. His hand, skillful with the deli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate instruments of the survey, was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">MEASURING A MERIDIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">133</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">home still more on his gun; and his eye,</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen to discern the remotest of stars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quick to detect the merest movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a gazelle. It was ever with something</seg><seg type="columnLine">of self-denial that he laid aside the char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acter of the hunter to resume the duties</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the astronomer. The bushman's un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">easiness was ere long renewed. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second day of Sir John's interval of rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reation, Mokoum had espied, nearly two</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles to the right, a herd of about twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the species of antelope known as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oryx. He told Sir John at once, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">advised him to take advantage of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortune that awaited him, adding that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oryx was extremely difficult to cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, and could outstrip the fleetest horse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that Cumming himself had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought down more than four.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THIS was more than enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">arouse the Englishman. He chose</seg><seg type="columnLine">his best gun, his best horse, and his best</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog, and in his impatience preceding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bushman, he turned toward the copse</seg><seg type="columnLine">bordering the plain where the antelopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been seen. In an hour they reined</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their horses, and Mokoum, concealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a grove of sycamores, pointed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his companion the herd grazing several</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards to leeward. He remarked</seg><seg type="columnLine">that one oryx kept apart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is a sentinel," he said, "and doubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less cunning enough. At the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger he will give his signal, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole troop will make their escape. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">must fire from a long distance, and hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the first shot."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir John nodded in reply, and sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a favorable position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The oryxes continued quietly grazing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sentinel, as though the breeze had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought suspicions of danger, often</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised his head, and looked warily</seg><seg type="columnLine">around. But he was too far away for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunters to fire at him with success, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to chase the herd over the plain was</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the question. The only hope of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a lucky issue was that the herd might</seg><seg type="columnLine">approach the copse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fortune seemed propitious. Gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">following the lead of the sentinel male,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the herd drew near the wood, their in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinct, perchance, making them aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was safer than the plain. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">their direction was seen, the bushman</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked his companion to dismount. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses were tied to a sycamore, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their heads covered to secure them from</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Followed by the dogs, the hunters</seg><seg type="columnLine">glided through the creepers and brush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood till they were within three hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred paces of the troop. Then, crouch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in ambush, and waiting with loaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns, they could admire the beauty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the animals. By a strange freak of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature, the females were armed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">horns more formidable than those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the males. The whole herd approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wood, and awhile remained station-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ary. The sentinel oryx, as it seemed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was urging them to leave the plain; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to be driving them, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what as a sheep-collie collects a flock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a compact mass. The herd seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely indifferent, and indisposed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">submit to the guidance of their leader.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bushman was perplexed; he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not understand the relative movements</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sentinel and the herd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir John began to get impatient. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidgeted with his rifle, sometimes want-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to fire, sometimes to advance; and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushman had some trouble to restrain</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. An hour passed away in this man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, when suddenly one of the dogs</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a loud bark, and rushed toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain. The bushman felt angry enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to send a ball into the excited brute. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">oryxes fled and Sir John saw at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">that pursuit was useless; in a few sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onds they were no more than black</seg><seg type="columnLine">specks in the grass. But to the bush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's astonishment it was not the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">male which had given the signal for</seg><seg type="columnLine">134</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">flight. The oryx remained in its place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without attempting to follow, and only</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to hide in the grass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Strange," said the bushman; "what</seg><seg type="columnLine">ails the creature? is he hurt, or crippled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with age?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We shall soon see," said Sir John,</seg><seg type="columnLine">advancing toward the animal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The oryx crouched more and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the grass; only the tips of his long</seg><seg type="columnLine">horns w'ere visible above the surface;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as he did not try to escape, Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">John could easily get near him. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a hundred paces he took aim and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired. The ball had struck the head, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horns sunk into the grass. The hunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers ran hastily to the spot. The bushman</seg><seg type="columnLine">held in his hand his hunting-knife, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">case the animal should still live. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">precaution was unnecessary; the oryx</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so dead, that when Sir John took</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold of the horns, he pulled nothing but</seg><seg type="columnLine">an empty flabby skin, containing not so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as a bone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By St. Andrew! these things happen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to no one but me," he cried, in a tone</seg><seg type="columnLine">so comical that anyone but the immov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able Mokoum would have laughed out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">right.

Perhaps I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have called time out to have been more exact-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, at the expense of sustained interest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stories of space ships no longer cite the ir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">relevant detail that the floors of the ships con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain a gravitational substance. The case-hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened science fiction reader knows this to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fact just as soon as he finds that the occu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pants of the ship do not float about in it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This privilege I may have stretched a point</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two, assuming that all minds would follow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that readers would realize that the Uchke ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied this same gravitational substance to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">inner world and to their island of light, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they did to the floors of their space ships.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This explains quite obviously why the Uchke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Plekne and Zoromes found no difficulty in</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking about the inner world. Let me add,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, that this artificial gravity did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">extend its field very far from the inner crust</seg><seg type="columnLine">and would have no effect upon the island of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. That is another angle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ironic allusion is cast upon the professor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleverness. Cleverness is relative, depending on</seg><seg type="columnLine">what standard you assume. I would hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">call the professor clever. Professor Jameson</seg><seg type="columnLine">has made several hazardous, yet foolish, moves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His impulsive entrance into the Tripeds' tran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sition cube is most outstanding proof of this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would really be a lot better if critics re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">frained from misquoting. In the Discussions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I find that my word "hurtle" has strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolutionized into "accelerate." The dictionary</seg><seg type="columnLine">says of the word Hurtle, "impel forcibly--</seg><seg type="columnLine">dash in collision." That is exactly what would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have happened if the Uchke bombardment had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a little bit stronger and had been directed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one portion of the mainland alone instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of from all directions. The island of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been forced rapidly through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">zero intensity of gravity, or lack of gravity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">acting much like a space ship from which there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a rocket release, or much closer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">similarity, a space ship struck by another mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dictionary says of Accelerate, "to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasten--to cause to progress faster." Beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the initial push, there would have been no</seg><seg type="columnLine">acceleration, for, as forementioned, the artificial</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity of the mainland possessed no attraction</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the tops of the tallest buildings, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is too short a distance to gain appreciable</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentum. In short, there is no claim in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story about the island's possibilities of picking</seg><seg type="columnLine">up acceleration. No reason exists for worry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the linotyper with integral signs and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponents, nor the patient readers, either, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">mathematical proof of something which has not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been contradicted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is quite true that the inner world was but</seg><seg type="columnLine">an insignificant comparison to the great, mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strous bulk of the surrounding hydrosphere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">something like a hollow buckshot inside of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid basketball, and it is probable that a zero</seg><seg type="columnLine">intensity of gravity did exist there; that is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the influence of the Uchke's artificial</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity. But, however, a great hollow globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as Edgar Rice Burroughs conceived in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his "Moon Maid," I believe, is quite another</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter. Zero intensity would exist, in this case,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only near the common center of the immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollow. The objects on the inner surface would</seg><seg type="columnLine">adhere to where they stood rather than feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same gravitational pull from the other side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hollow moon (assuming for sake of</seg><seg type="columnLine">argument that it is hollow) when that other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side is removed more than a thousand miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant, and after all is but a comparatively</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin crust of material. If such attractions were</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal, regardless of proximity, Venus could</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily pull us off the earth and hold us sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended halfway between that planet and ours.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Drag out your exponents and integral signs if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will, but hearken, son of man. great mathe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matical minds proved conclusively long ago</seg><seg type="columnLine">that airplanes could not fly.

To</seg><seg type="columnLine">conduct such an experiment, you must free</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself from the earth's gravity so that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will have your gravitational zero intensity in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which to place your experimental objects, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">you might invent a gravitational nullifier.
