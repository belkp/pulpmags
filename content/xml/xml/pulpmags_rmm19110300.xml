About four o'clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the morning a coach full of dozing pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sengers was suddenly roused by a series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood-curdling shrieks.

The yarder's throttle flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, and it dashed through a split switch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">butted a coach off the Wabash train and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent it sprawling into the ditch. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock derailed the switcher, but it scram-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled along on the ties until it ran into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Union Pacific switch-engine and knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">it also into the ditch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This second shock deflected the Rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">Island engine far enough for it to reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and yank the engine off an incoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHIMS OF THE WHEELS.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">195</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">passenger-train of its own line and hurl it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into the ditch.

As related by Gen-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eral Manager L. E. John-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">son, of the Norfolk and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Western, the turkey-hunter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">presently met a fast train,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and, with true Southern</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chivalry, stepped aside and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gave it the whole road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A little scrub-bull which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had also wandered onto the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">track was less polite, how-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ever. Instead of getting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out of the way, the bull</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drew a mark in the ballast</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with one forefoot, threw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">some dirt on his back, and then, with low-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ered head, dared the train to cross the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mark. Well, it crossed the mark all right,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at fifty miles an hour, and the bull--oh!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">where was he?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Probably no one could answer that ques-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion in full, but it is known that for a very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brief fraction of a second the bull and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">turkey-hunter both tried to occupy the same</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spot at the same time, which, as every</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one knows, is impossible. The result was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that the turkey-hunter was knocked into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a pond, which broke his fall and un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">doubtedly saved his life. He was severe-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ly hurt. His shotgun was knocked out of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his hands, and in falling was discharged,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and two cows that had the misfortune to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be in range of the buckshot were killed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">^ When he recovered, the turkey-hunter,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as was natural, sued the railroad company</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for illegally, unlawfully, and against the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">peace of the sovereign State of North</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Carolina, throwing one bull at him by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which aforesaid illegal and unlawful act</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he suffered grievous bodily harm. At the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">same time, which probably was also nat-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ural, the owner pf the cows sued the tur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">key-hunter for shooting them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After two notable trials, the unfeeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">court held that the railroad company owed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the turkey-hunter nothing for hitting him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a bull, but that he owed the farmer</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hundred dollars for killing his cows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When such things as this can happen, is it</seg><seg type="columnLine">any wonder that railroads are unpopular?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PASSENGERS WERE SUDDENLY AROUSED BY</seg><seg type="columnLine">A SERIES OF BLOOD-CURDLING SHRIEKS.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No, he who wants justice from a rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">road will get quicker action if he takes</seg><seg type="columnLine">matters into his own hands.

The doors being closed, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows being double, and the trucks hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing dropped off, the car filled slowly as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">floated down the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was very early, before the passengers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were up. The men inside broke open the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventilators, and, with the aid of outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">help, all hands were rescued. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">two women passengers who tumbled out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their berths, clad only in their night-robes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with their hair done up in curl-papers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had to hang on to the curtain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pole with the water up to their arms; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it certainly looked as if they were going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drown with the rest of the passengers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet General Manager Johnson declares</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon his honor that when they were res-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cued their hair was neatly done up.

Little by</seg><seg type="columnLine">little Walton forged ahead.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">secured new positions--and lost them.

He married three years after</seg><seg type="columnLine">he separated from his- comrade, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bride's name was Grace. Watson heard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wedding, and cursed them. Time, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of cooling his enmity for his former</seg><seg type="columnLine">chum, bolstered and increased it, and alco-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hol did the rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In many a frenzy he promised Stockbridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">a speedy end if the two ever met.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Watson drifted eastward by slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">stages. By changing his name repeatedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he landed in brief-held positions. L^nknow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, the Southwestern itself paid a frequent</seg><seg type="columnLine">wage to the operator who jumped from place</seg><seg type="columnLine">to place, and Watson smiled grimly when-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever he noticed orders from the chief train-</seg><seg type="columnLine">despatcher's office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were always signed " Stockbridge.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " He's up and I'm down," Watson reflect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed bitterly.

Superheating is not a new-fan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled idea, as some persons suppose, the opinion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some being that the superheater on a locomotive</seg><seg type="columnLine">is something that has been imagined in the mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some enthusiast on fuel economy, and is con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequently additional apparatus with which to fill</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the already crowded front-end of a locomo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive, and which will result in nothing. Super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heating is not by any means a new idea, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">at present it is being put to uses that were un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard of years ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ever since the laws of expansion and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traction have become recognized, superheating,</seg><seg type="columnLine">both of solids and gases, has been practised with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a definite purpose in view, viz., to gain a greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">efficiency out of the substance being heated than</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have been obtained by any other means.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There are two or three known laws that govern</seg><seg type="columnLine">the working of the superheater on a steam-en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gine. From one of these, called Mariotte's law,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it is found that the density of a gas increases as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pressure increases, and decreases as the volume</seg><seg type="columnLine">increases. From another, known as Gay-Lus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sac's law, we learn that if the pressure remains</seg><seg type="columnLine">constant every increase of temperature oj one</seg><seg type="columnLine">degree F. produces in a given quantity of gas an</seg><seg type="columnLine">expansion of 1.492 of its volume at 32 degrees F.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the principle of this should be very easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a fireman to understand, in that every degree</seg><seg type="columnLine">of superheat produces an expansion of the steam,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which results either in greater pressure, if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">volume is constant, or in greater volume if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure remains constant. The steam generated</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a locomotive-boiler is called saturated steam,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in fact steam in any boiler is in the same con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition, saturated; that is to say, it has a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of moisture with the steam. This is due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the bubbles of steam coming up through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water being surrounded by a thin film of water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this thin film naturally causes an amount of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water to become mixed with the steam; thus it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">called saturated steam.--Locomotive Firemen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Engine men's Magazine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THE HORNET'S NEST</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BY DAN DUANE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">            The Longest and Most Turbulent River</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">            Will Always Find Its Way to the Sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXII.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">When Greek Meets Greek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Til WATERS cantered down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pike astride of the brown horse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortably seated in the sad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle, urging him on with the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">reins of the bridle.

Just one more to the old world and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rosalia and Carmita, whom he had so</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautifully fooled, and he would take his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to the mountains, and the price for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body would become a relic of the past!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The next saloon was in the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town's activity. Like the first one that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">visited, there were some horses tied to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trough outside. This place seemed to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit gayer than the first. There were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen or so men seated on the porch. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interior came the dulcet tones of man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dolin and guitar, played as only the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the southland can play.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The men eyed Seth Waters rather keenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he entered the place--and he seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie more than usually conscious that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being observed. Then he tried to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself think that his imagination was get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting the best of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As in the former place, he ordered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink. As he lifted it to his lips, he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scanned the walls. There were more</seg><seg type="columnLine">people in this place than in the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some of them were standing against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls and it was difficult to see, but Seth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen eyes peered hither and yon and soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">they rested on the notice posted in a rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">conspicuous place at the end of the bar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">228</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He swallowed the whisky and sauntered</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to the notice. He had left his rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside, strapped to his saddle, as he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">it best not to attract too much attention by</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing it into the place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps, if he had not done so, the fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing incident would not have happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">without the side issue of a struggle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seth had just turned to go.

" Lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">your arms."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An immense crowd had gathered outside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seth Waters was marched to the jail.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple of grate-bars are either pulled up</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the former, or pushed up by the latter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and through the opening in the grate thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">provided, the contents of the fire-box is</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped into the ash-pan, from whence it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is raked into the pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They don't seem to enthuse over drop or</seg><seg type="columnLine">dump-grates in that country, but they ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peal to me as being far more sensible than</seg><seg type="columnLine">this clumsy method, in which the grate-bars</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to be knocked out of place every trip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It may be added that with very few excep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions the fire is always drawn 011 arrival.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On completion of this performance, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine is taken into the " running shed "</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be " stabled," and to have the flues</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleaned out, the next item in the regular</seg><seg type="columnLine">routine which is never departed from. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shed is of the longitudinal type, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is commonly used in England, with three</seg><seg type="columnLine">or four tracks running straight through it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it become necessary to have the tubes " run "</seg><seg type="columnLine">or cleaned immediately, because after be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing placed in position another engine may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be put in front of it, rendering the operation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tube-cleaning impracticable. If, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, the shed is round, similar to our round-</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses, the operation may be performed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time convenient to the " tube-runners."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Furbishing Up a Locomotive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To clean a set of flues requires from forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sixty minutes. I was much amused to</seg><seg type="columnLine">note that the flue-cleaner used the primitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrangement of a long rod with a piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas threaded into the end. I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">see flues cleaned by compressed-air any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where in England, although at Paddington,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Great Western, I did locate a system</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blowing them by steam, the latter being</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnished from a small vertical boiler.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next in order comes the wiping or clean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the engine. In the majority of Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lish roundhouses each cleaner follows his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own engine, and gang-cleaning, such as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">is universally followed in this country, is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">popular. Needless to add that this work is</seg><seg type="columnLine">performed witli scrupulous care.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When ready for business, those engines</seg><seg type="columnLine">are things of beauty beyond dispute. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a single part is missed in the wiping, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluding the brake-levers under the tender</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even the bottom of the ash-pan. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">is one of the time-honored institutions also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they would no more think of slighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">it than they would the work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After wiping comes the "bar-laying,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which operation the grates previously</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked out to dump the fire are replaced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This is done either by a long pair of tongs</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the outside, or by a boy who goes into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire-box and who, after putting them</seg><seg type="columnLine">into place, rakes off the accumulation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashes from the top of the brick arch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The "lighter-up" then throws a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">shovels of coal around the fire-box, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two scoops of fire in the center, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">locomotive is again ready for business. Qf</seg><seg type="columnLine">course there may be running repairs, such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as reducing brasses, applying packing, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what not, which may further delay the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gine several hours, but what has been out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lined is the inevitable procedure in connec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion with every engine which appears on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coal-shed track. After all is finally com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted it is set outside to make house-room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly as in our own practise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Some Amazing Wages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Labor is very poorly compensated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">English railroad shops, even when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheaper possibility of living is taken under</seg><seg type="columnLine">consideration. Skilled boilermakers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinists receive wages which in Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can money would amount to $1.68 for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">day's work of maybe twelve hours, if it hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pens to be a " running shed " in which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are working, and other occupations are not</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly so well paid. In many instances,</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineers hauling the fastest express-trains</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not receive over two dollars for a round-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip run lasting all day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On one occasion I came down from Glas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gow to Carlisle on the engine of the London</seg><seg type="columnLine">West Coast Express, which is operated be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the two cities jointly by the Cale-</seg><seg type="columnLine">donian and the London and Northwestern</seg><seg type="columnLine">Railways. This was a non-stop, round-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip run from Glasgow to Carlisle, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">are 103 miles apart.

If the above may be taken as</seg><seg type="columnLine">an average for their pay, and I believe it</seg><seg type="columnLine">may, as I made many inquiries along that</seg><seg type="columnLine">line, what of the minor occupations about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "running sheds," the "tube-runners,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">" bar-layers," " lighters-up," and so on?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I do not believe that for unskilled labor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is, labor without a trade behind it, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">average pay is more than 4s. or ninety-six</seg><seg type="columnLine">cents per day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In " running sheds," where piece-work is</seg><seg type="columnLine">in vogue for wiping engines, blowing flues,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other work which is going on all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, it is of course possible to make more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than this, but not a great deal more. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned in the beginning of this article</seg><seg type="columnLine">what happens to the piece-work rate as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it becomes evident that big wages are</seg><seg type="columnLine">being earned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Engineers seem to be well content with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their pay and with their position. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in many of their homes and they ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear to live comfortably and enjoy life when</seg><seg type="columnLine">off duty, but I can't understand how they</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it. The current story on this side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water that money will go three times as far</seg><seg type="columnLine">in England is a fallacy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Divided into Classes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is difficult to get the commonest kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a meal for eighteen cents.

I imagine that if a railroad</seg><seg type="columnLine">man is caught away from home he buys the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighteen-cent kind or goes without, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not afford many of the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These men should have more money. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are divided into classes, and they are years</seg><seg type="columnLine">and years working up to a place in the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">class at the head of the fast express-trains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The through-freights, or " goods " trains,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are worked by second-class men, and most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the long runs are what is called " double</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">home," although instead of doubling back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which might be inferred from the designa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, exactly the reverse is the case.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For instance, on the Great Western Rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, a train from Swindon to Exeter is</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked through to its destination, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew takes rest at Exeter, returning to Swin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don the next day on the balancing train.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The effect of this arrangement is that an</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer and fireman must be away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their home terminal at least three nights in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a week and must necessarily pay board, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less bunk-rooms are provided by the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany, and I saw very few of them on Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lish railroads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The local freights are worked by third-</seg><seg type="columnLine">class men, and are almost invariably " single</seg><seg type="columnLine">home" jobs--that is, the men take rest at</seg><seg type="columnLine">their home station.

Relief work is of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">most irregular, and is provided for the pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose of keeping the hours of the trainmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">within reasonable limits when trains are</seg><seg type="columnLine">running late, owing to fog, congested .state</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the road, or other causes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It struck me as being a long trip from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fireman's berth to that of a first-class en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gineer. The firemen generally rise from</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine-cleaners, and pass through all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grades enumerated above, before getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold of the throttle of a switch-engine. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the roads, the men firing the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant trains are runners themselves, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been tempted to give up hauling a</seg><seg type="columnLine">freight-train for the shorter passenger hours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even though the pay is less for firing than</seg><seg type="columnLine">for running.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The actual running skill required to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fast British trains over the road on time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not impress me as being nearly so great</seg><seg type="columnLine">as that of the men who handled the De</seg><seg type="columnLine">Glehn compounds hauling the Paris-Ca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lais boat-train on the French Northern Rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. In the first place, the locomotives are</seg><seg type="columnLine">in perfect trim when delivered by the " run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning sheds," the road-bed is perfection, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the block-signaling system is the finest in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In the majority of instances the engines</seg><seg type="columnLine">RUNNING A BRITISH RAILWAY.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">249</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">are of the two-cylinder simple-expansion</seg><seg type="columnLine">type, exactly as they are here, although a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great many of them are built with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders inside the frames and driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cranked main-axle, instead of being out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side and driving the wheel through a crank-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pin.

The shorter the</seg><seg type="columnLine">radius the sharper the curve. The length of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">radius is usually stated in feet.

A.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">fireman with an interest in his work should reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engine soon enough before starting-time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the fire in the condition most favorable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">making steam for the start. A hard and fast line</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot be recommended, because the conditions</seg><seg type="columnLine">under which the start is made must influence to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great extent the kind of fire that must be on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grates. A heavy, hard-pulling train starting upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ascending grade through the street of a town</seg><seg type="columnLine">and long yards, will call for a fire different from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that which is necessary when the train is light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and easy grades are met at the start without yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">and streets that demand the fireman's attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">to signals. At all events, when the train is ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to start there should be a glowing fire on the grates</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a depth sufficient to keep up steam until after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reverse-lever has been notched back and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">train worked into speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> (2)	The good fireman maintains the fire in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition to suit die work which the engine has</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do. At parts of the road where the grades</seg><seg type="columnLine">materially increase the work to be done, he makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire heavier to suit the circumstances. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">is done gradually and not by pitching a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge into the fire-box at one time. This system</seg><seg type="columnLine">of steady firing keeps the temperature of the boiler</seg><seg type="columnLine">as even as possible, and has the double result of</seg><seg type="columnLine">being easy on the boiler and using the fuel to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best advantage. The fire should be maintained</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly level and the coal supplied so that the sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">and corners of the fire-box are well filled, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">there the liability to drawing air is most imminent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BY THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">263</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">With this system closefy followed, (here should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be no difficulty in keeping up a steady head of</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> (3)	When a hole appears in the fire it should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be promptly located and filled, either by throwing</seg><seg type="columnLine">lump-coal into it or by leveling the fire to cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. It is, of course, apparent that the presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a hole concentrates the draft largely in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter and has a most detrimental effect on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">combustion which should be going on uniformly</seg><seg type="columnLine">all over the grate-bars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> (4)	The blower should be used principally to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry off the smoke, which has a tendency to trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the engine is shut off. It can best be pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vented by refraining from putting in fresh coal for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few moments before the throttle is closed. Other</seg><seg type="columnLine">uses for the blower will from time to time suggest</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves to any observant fireman. The blower</seg><seg type="columnLine">should not be left on any longer around stations</seg><seg type="columnLine">than is absolutely necessary. In addition to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">discomfort occasioned by its noise, it will blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">away considerable steam at the pops.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> (5)	When approaching a stopping-place, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fireman should be careful to have a sufficiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy fire prepared as a preliminary, so that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">will not have to commence firing until the start is</seg><seg type="columnLine">made. If this has been neglected, however, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">better to throw in a fresh supply of coal while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine is standing at the station. The common</seg><seg type="columnLine">practise of throwing open the door and com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mencing to fire as soon as the throttle is opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">is very hard on the fire-boxes, because the cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">air drawn through the door strikes the fire-box</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheets and tubes, contracting the metal and tend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to produce leakages. Firing just as a train is</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulling out of a station is bad for another reason.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At that time, the fireman should be assisting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer in looking out for the signals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> (6)	It depends entirely on the conditions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road and run.

"You wait with her a min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute, and I will see if breakfast is ready."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He darted into the restaurant. The girls</seg><seg type="columnLine">were left alone for a moment. Keen is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">perception of woman--aye, keener and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrating than that of man. Although</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clifford had not divulged to May Pierce--</seg><seg type="columnLine">either by look or word or sign--even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest hint of the understanding that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">arisen between Elaine and him, its truth</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed into her mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Clifford dashed to the restaurant, May</seg><seg type="columnLine">took her friend's hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " What a beautiful morning!

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't heed the time-worn remark about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather, but, looking Elaine straight in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye, she said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Elaine--Elaine--I think I know why</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are so late this morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Why, May, dear--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Elaine, may I--" She drew close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her chum and whispered with every atom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sincerity:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I congratulate you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elaine tried to brush away a tear.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">" you can't fool a woman," and no one knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fact better than a woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Most of the passengers were on deck at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time, peering into the clear offing where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sharp outline of old England's coast was</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing more perceptible with each revolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the boat's propellers. The few who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were below at the time, and happened to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">two pretty young women in each other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms, hugging and patting and kissing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been a bit surprised; but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no more surprised than George Clifford</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he returned to escort them to the res-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taurant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew, the moment he saw them, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cat was out of the bag. At heart he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not sorry, for it would divert the conversa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to the subject that was foremost in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind--and, too, it was evidence that Elaine</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken him seriously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " I congratulate you, too," said May, of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fering Clifford her hand.

The vast ocean, as ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served from shore, fills one with awe. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">power and majesty are difficult to compre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hend, and frequently the observer looks at</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with a touch of fear. But the sight of land</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the sea is an entirely different matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One looks upon it as an old friend. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to hold out some welcoming, cheering</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope, and as it grows from a dim, darkened</seg><seg type="columnLine">outline--as the ship approaches--until it</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes the more visible form of mountains</seg><seg type="columnLine">and valleys, with cities nestling here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, it seems to assure us that we belong to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and not to the vast stretches of water that</seg><seg type="columnLine">surround it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something of this sort stirred the heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Elaine. When the trio went up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurricane deck, after the rather elaborate</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast which Clifford had ordered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">which partly served as a feast to celebrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engagement--although Elaine said that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she would not as yet give her consent--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the green cliffs of the British mainland were</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly to be seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The passengers were all on deck now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those who thought that they knew were</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing out spots of interest. V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big boat had the currents and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tide in her favor. As the land loomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger, she seemed to move faster. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day was more than three hours past the</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon, the Titan was inside the harbor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elaine had stood on one side of George</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clifford and May on the other. Every new</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that came to their view caused them</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the joy of the traveler who is making</seg><seg type="columnLine">his journey for the first time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Finally the Titan was ready for the dock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THROUGH BY SUNRISE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">267</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She was slowly nosing into the little harbor</seg><seg type="columnLine">studded with all manner of craft. More</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy than all the rest were the puffing tugs</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were to see the liner safe alongside her</seg><seg type="columnLine">wharf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We had better go down now and finish</seg><seg type="columnLine">packing," said May, breaking the silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She darted off, leaving George and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elaine alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Isn't it glorious, Elaine ?

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, whose wife by that word she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised to be, squeezed her hand with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the assurance that the situation afforded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They hurried to their staterooms, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was little time left for the final</seg><seg type="columnLine">packing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they appeared on deck again, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had all their traveling-bags with them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">England being a free - trade country, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveler is not molested by inquisitive cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toms' agents.

There they spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night. In the morning, when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked out of the windows of the little hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the Inns of Court--that historic sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of old London devotedly loved by its</seg><seg type="columnLine">corps of barristers--a dense fog enveloped</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One must really experience a London fog</seg><seg type="columnLine">to understand its density.

So George</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed, and I know that you will want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear the story that he related about Cobs</seg><seg type="columnLine">before we journey on with our friends to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Devon. This is just as he told it:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How can we do it?"

The con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cern was the biggest in the business, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canniness of McKenzie Lawrie, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">founder, seemed to pass, with other assets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from heir to heir. It was an unwritten</seg><seg type="columnLine">but stanchly honored law that the eldest</seg><seg type="columnLine">son of the head of the firm should, at birth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">be made a full-fledged partner, his share of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the profits being duly placed to his credit</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the care of a regularly appointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">guardian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When this son was of an age to begin his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life-work, he took up his burdens of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">business as a matter of preordination.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And this routine had stood for four gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erations, Jack being the last link in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chain of the Lawrie traditions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Long before his son had left college, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lawrie, with the fatuity of a stubborn</seg><seg type="columnLine">father, had planned a matrimonial alliance</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Jack, which would mean the ending of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ancient business feud between Lawrie &amp;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Son, and its only rival of note, Closely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bardon &amp; Hollister. As a matter of fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there wasn't a Bardon or a Hollister any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, but there was a Closely, and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">legions in himself. Closely had an only</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter. Bethida was a trifle passe, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THROUGH BY SUNRISE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">269</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">haps, but she looked pretty well at dinner</seg><seg type="columnLine">. if the candle shades were of the right color</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sufficiently opaque. She was square-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldered, rode to hounds, and was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">member of several women's clubs. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Closely was rich. He limped with a su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perb gout and possessed a nose of the hue</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dimensions of a beet-root. He wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">averse to an honorable peace with Lawrie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it didn't mean an appearance of defeat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a lessening of revenue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lawrie had sounded Closely about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">welding of business interests, by means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a union of Jack and Bethida, and Closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped--metaphorically, of course--at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea. Then followed discussions and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventions, and at length it was agreed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interests of the two firms should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">pooled on the day of Jack's engagement to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bethida, to the utter confusion and over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw of all rival fiber concerns, great or</seg><seg type="columnLine">small.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jack, on the completion of his college</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, was promptly shipped to Europe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and told to remain there for at least two</seg><seg type="columnLine">years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I am going to make you travel, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy," said Mr. Lawrie, "so that you may</seg><seg type="columnLine">find out how deuced little you know.

Jack met the girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was a trifle disgusted, but yet more</seg><seg type="columnLine">amused, at her mannish fads. Miss Close-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, having in mind her approaching thirties,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made up to Jack as best she knew how. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the young fellow, in his wildest flights</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fancy, never dreamed that Miss Closely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been taken into her father's con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidence, looked upon him as a prospective</seg><seg type="columnLine">husband.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, he never suspected that his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">father had taken the liberty of mapping out</seg><seg type="columnLine">his matrimonial career.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So a year passed. The husband of Jack's</seg><seg type="columnLine">only sister died suddenly, and the widow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her two children became members of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Lawrie mansion on Madison Avenue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The girls were respectively six and eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ol age. Elinor, the eldest, was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicate. It was decided to entrust the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liminary education of the girls to a nursery</seg><seg type="columnLine">governess, and Beatrice Tolliver obtained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the position. It may be that way down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tough old heart of Mr. Lawrie there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a touch of compunction for Beatrice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose father had died after the going up</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his firm, which was put out of business</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Lawrie &amp; Son's cornering operation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Miss Tolliver was a wildfiower kind of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, with eyes of vivid violet and a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonality that exuded the delicate sweetness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an evening primrose. Jack promptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell in love with her, and after months of</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet and persistent wooing, she at length</seg><seg type="columnLine">acknowledged that she had just as promptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen in love with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of the storm in the Lawrie household</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Jack told his father of his feelings</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the girl, of the threats, promises, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">entreaties with which Mr. Lawrie sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shake his son's determination to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beatrice his wife, of the final expulsion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack from the firm, plus his two thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hundred dollars, and minus his bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liant prospects, and of the amazement that</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled the fiber world when, on the day of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack's marriage, the sign over the offices on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Water Street was altered from Lawrie &amp;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Son to Lawrie &amp; Company, this history</seg><seg type="columnLine">need not deal in detail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a rather prolonged honeymoon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack obtained a position as buyer with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rival of his father, rented a little house in</seg><seg type="columnLine">New Lyons, a residential city on the Sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnished it prettily, and began to taste</seg><seg type="columnLine">the delights of the spring-time of matri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mony.

Larry was blessed with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> thrift. All men who know the value of a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> dollar are blessed with it. He took with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> him only sufficient to travel so far as the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> railroad ran--and he haggled with agents</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> for second-class tickets and tourist rates</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> until they were willing to grant his wishes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> out of sheer despair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    Leaving the final terminus, of the rail-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> road. he embarked in a small steamboat up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the Svvamac.

He had talked with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them time and again on the little wharf at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fifty Hole, the most northerly point on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Swamac where the boat stopped. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally, when it did arrive there and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">down 'stream on its homeward journey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larry watched it with a plaintive watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it disappeared around a bend between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the high palisades that guarded its banks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he turned to the Indians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The gold-fields were miles and miles far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther north. He would find them by fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing the Swamac some ten miles, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, by making an overland journey of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some five or six miles, he would save some</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance caused by a bend in the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he reached the river again, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would find a portage.

Once across,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he should follow the trail--it would not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard to find--follow it for another five</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles or more. Then Opliir and Monte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zuma and King Solomon's mines were his!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Larry reached his destination. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild, desolate spot. The river was near</seg><seg type="columnLine">by; for that he was thankful. As far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eye could see, there were great moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains that rolled upward to fields of eternal*</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow. Around him was a massive prairie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked hither and yon with clumps of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees and stretches of grass, and the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">imposing effect in this wilderness was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, rock}- mountain--perhaps it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be more modest to call it a hill--that jutted</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the earth more like a peculiar monu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment than anything else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Undoubtedly, this was the storehouse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gold. Beyond all doubt, this was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">receptacle of -his fortune. Within it? rock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribbed sides rested the real thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Truly, Mohammed had come to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He would delve into it without further</seg><seg type="columnLine">ado, fill a scuttle or two of the precious</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal, and make his way back to Fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hole. Then he would return for another</seg><seg type="columnLine">scuttle or two--and so on until he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">accumulated sufficient to fill the steamboat</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it reached Fifty Hole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he would hike back to his mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his native town and buy the N. X.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and any other road that might happen to lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the market.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he ceased building his castles in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air, it dawned upon him that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling somewhat lonesome. Of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no human habitation in sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Larry was the first of his race and blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">to inhabit the place. He had brought bacon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crackers and tea. He had also brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">matches carefully rolled in a piece of rub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber cloth, and a pipe and some tobacco;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as lie gazed over the wild circumjacence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie realized that he had not a place to lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps it would be best to return to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fifty Hole and camp there, and make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey to and from the mountain of gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">every day. Brilliant thought! He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">then be a commuter in the wilderness. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he looked at the sun just beginning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tip the mountains in the west, he knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not make Fifty Hole again that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Near the base of the mountain of gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found a little space that nature had</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused between two large boulders. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock rose sharp and perpendicular on either</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, the floor .was covered with a fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravel, and the entire opening gave him</seg><seg type="columnLine">some six square feet in which to seek some</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It lacked a roof, but that troubled him</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a little. The night was clear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no sign of rain or wind. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides, it was only for one night--and surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man could rough it for one night when</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortune was all around him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood between the two boulders--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance to his primeval home--and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">around. What a wonderful stillness! What</seg><seg type="columnLine">a marvelous quiet! Adjusting his pack so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it rested against the boulder, he stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The twilight was just beginning to dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landscape. He stepped a few feet far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther and stopped short; just why, he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not tell. A cold wind suddenly swept over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prairie--the cold, peculiar wind that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to be born of nightfall, and is known</seg><seg type="columnLine">only in such places.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It made him button his coat about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat. He listened again. He thought he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not an unfamiliar sound. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">cocked his head to one side to be sure, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then started in its direction. It came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a projection of the hill about a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet away. He walked thither to explore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sound was water -- water gushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a spring and rilling along the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly to the Swamac. He knelt down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drank of it. He hastened back to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cache and returned with his tin kettle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">276</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Good ! " he said aloud. " I will not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to make a trip to the river every time</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want water."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That excitement over, he stood again in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entrance of his primeval home. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river banks now came the croak of</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange throats, and, overhead, some strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird circled and uttered shrill cries. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up at it and wondered why it</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he thought it was about time for</seg><seg type="columnLine">food. Gathering some dry branches, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon had a fire. Over the fire he placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his frying-pan. As it warmed, he sliced a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen strips from the side of bacon. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">he threw the slices into the pan, they sizzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and browned and smelled--like home!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He placed the frying-pan on the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Picking up the bacon slice by slice in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers he devoured it, with crackers as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">side dish and cool spring water for wine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a rough meal--the first, indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had ever cooked. But what mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered that, when the price of a railroad or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two lay at his feet?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a short time it was pitch-dark. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">prairie wind was blowing up colder. Like-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise, it was blowing with more force. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a wonderful wind, that wind of the north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">western plains. When it does blow, it has</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the force of a northern Titan sweeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world. There is 110 obstacle in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">path -- nothing to block the mighty mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentum that it gains as the night comes on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It blew right into the opening of Larry's</seg><seg type="columnLine">primeval home. So great was its velocity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nurtured in the northern Canadian prairies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and increasing in volume as it came on</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the south, that it took Larry's side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bacon and his frying-pan and other ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jects of primeval art and swept them up</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the roofless habitat into the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such slight and simple commodities as</seg><seg type="columnLine">his crackers and his Oolong tea were as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves of yester year in its path. He drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself into the further corner of the abode.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With his legs close together, his muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn taut, and both hands holding his hat</seg><seg type="columnLine">down over his tightly closed eyes, he won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered if he hadn't struck the only and</seg><seg type="columnLine">original cave of the winds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is a shine dump,'' said Larry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He jammed his hat down tight, for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms were getting numb. This change</seg><seg type="columnLine">lasted only the faintest fraction of a second.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The very instant that he dropped his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his side, he felt the wind getting under</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his hat, and he slammed his hands on it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hammerlike velocity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he removed his hat and placed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">between his knees. That gave his arms a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest. He didn't mind the breezes doing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">]o-the-poor-Indian stunt with his locks, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he felt the cold pierce his scalp</seg><seg type="columnLine">with none too tender touches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Pie thought that he would light his pipe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and try to smoke. His attempt to fill the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowl in that wind was a farce. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crass darkness, he could not tell which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe and which was pouch; and ere he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew it, the fine-cut was flying up into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face and eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Believing that he had the bowl of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe filled, he turned his face to the wall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his abode and brought his matches from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket. The first one that he struck went</seg><seg type="columnLine">out; so did the second; so did the third; so</seg><seg type="columnLine">did the fourth--and so did the fourteenth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At the end of this, score, he decided that</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoking was a luxury that he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">afford--matches were too scarce. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">resolved to have one more try. He crouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">down--down in the corner of the abode--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he drew his coat over his head and doubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself up into every conceivable posture</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would keep the howling wind from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then he took out another match. \\ ith</seg><seg type="columnLine">the caution of a surgeon cutting through a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   O	OO</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">vein, he struck it on his leg. It flickered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flamed up. With equal caution he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust it into the bowl of his pipe, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffed. None of the old, familiar flavor</seg><seg type="columnLine">permeated his palate. He simply drew in</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. The tobacco that he had put in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe--if, indeed, he had really done so--</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been carried away by the wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " This is a shine dump," said Larry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He replaced his hat and jammed it tight</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his head. Bracing his back against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back wall of his apartment, he sat down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing his knees close to his chin. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">clasped his hands about his knees, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">huddled himself closer and closer together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">_ He thought that he would be comfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this position. To give him credit, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at it philosophically. It was only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of passing the night. To be sure, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a trifle foolish in leaving Fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hole that day without knowing more about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his destination, but in the morning he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would return to Fifty Hole and arrange for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proper covering to give him shelter un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til he had dug sufficient from the mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gold to satisfy his cravings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">LARRY LEFT ALONE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">277</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Compounds and cross-bars, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold! Colder, indeed, than he had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt even in that northern territory of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States where he had lived since</seg><seg type="columnLine">boyhood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt his hands getting more numb and</seg><seg type="columnLine">still more numb. He removed them from</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his knees and thrust them into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pockets. Ah, that felt good! That was--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presto! His hat blew off! It was lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his head with such marvelous sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denness* that it seemed as if some magic</seg><seg type="columnLine">wand, not the wind, were responsible for its</seg><seg type="columnLine">departure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is a shine dump," said Larry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took his handkerchief from his pock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">et and tied it under his chin. That, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least, would protect his head from the ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible cold. Then he huddled up closer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed his eyes. Perhaps he might fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep. Perhaps the guarding Providence</seg><seg type="columnLine">would temper the wind to his shorn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsheltered seclusion, and let him have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little peace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He closed his eyes. He closed them so</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly that he clenched his teeth instinc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively--and there he sat, and still sat, won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering just how many hours still remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the dawn. In truth, he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">there but an hour since darkness. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an eternity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally there came a lull in the wind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larry knew this because the seemingly in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessant and unmodulating noise that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">made as it coursed through the trees and</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the wastes had somewhat abated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inside his primeval abode there was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet. Outside, the wind seemed to be ta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">king a more spasmodic velocity. Every lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle while it would cause a terrific rustling</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the trees, and then it would die away</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if intent on spending itself with brag</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bluster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was some blow," said Larry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stretched himself out on the hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. With one arm for a pillow, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for rest. His bones ached, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain buzzed with the night noises that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not cease, but he began to doze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Sleep is not recreation; it is re-creation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If ever a man needed to be re-created, Larry</seg><seg type="columnLine">did that night.

He sat straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, with every faculty alert. It was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">as dark as Stygian desolation; but.it was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">calmer, and there was only the faintest</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze astir.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Faint though it was, it brought to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nostrils the most peculiar odor that ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeted his sense of smell. It reminded</seg><seg type="columnLine">him of the animal tent of a circus. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sniffed--and then he sniffed some more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a rustling on the gravel out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side--a rustling -as if some animal were</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing to and iro.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Larry's heart-beats were as audible as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular striking of a clock.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">danced around him, yelled and screamed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in every possible manner exhibited their</seg><seg type="columnLine">delight at the anticipated suffering of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">victim. With yells and "thunder shouts"</seg><seg type="columnLine">they turned the savage horse loose. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounded away in fright. He darted</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the woods, rearing and plunging,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and inflicting on his tortured rider count-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less wounds and blows as he dashed against</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees and rushed through the tangled brush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kenton and the animal were lacerated</seg><seg type="columnLine">with thorns and briers.

His tongue</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lips were split and bleeding. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">own blood from the smarting cracks min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled with his food, but Salarado did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes roved warily to the hill-top</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had recently stood. The blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">throbbing in his ears made him restless and</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneasy. It sounded like hoofs rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounding the prairie sod.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From almost beneath his feet, a jack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rabbit sprang up and awkwardly limped</seg><seg type="columnLine">away with swaying ears.

With a few pieces of silk thread</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his neck-scarf--the same to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he so largely owed his escape--he tightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied all the openings in the skin.

The jurymen were coming. Salara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">do did not forget that. Yet water he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have or die.

With all his cloth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on Salarado crawled into the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a momentary bath. It was a danger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous thing to do, but refreshment and stimu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lant he must have.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The jurymen had found his whisky-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle empty and broken, twenty miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">back.

The dead animal more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled it. He thrust his knife into the dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal's body. In a few moments the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unfit to drink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Salarado grabbed up the dressed rabbit</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his water-bottle, and precipitously fled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the wind.

Chagrin that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickens the heart would be theirs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Salarado was pleased.

Impediments</seg><seg type="columnLine">which to a larger frame would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible were easily passed through, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">under, by little Ruth. Under fallen logs</seg><seg type="columnLine">she crept on all fours, and through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interwoven underbrush close to the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">she went like a rabbit From far below</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the sounds of pursuit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once, indeed, did Ruth&gt; abnormally</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharpened ears catch the sound of ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching footsteps.

When he shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed out her name in a voice heard a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, the xhild crouched to the ground like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fawn. When he had passed on along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain-side, but was still in sight, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back turned, Ruth darted into a thicket and</seg><seg type="columnLine">noiselessly made her way up the steep in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cline, stopping now and then to hide and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest when she heard the noise of a searcher</seg><seg type="columnLine">near.	^</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last they were all below her.

Stepping</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the assurance of a mountain goat out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the very edge, she nimbly climbed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tip of a projecting crag.

Far below in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bluish depths of the evening air Ruth</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw her mother. For one fleeting instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason returned. She uttered a cry for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother and toddled on the edge, about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall hundreds of feet to the now black rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">below; but the horror of it all instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">banished reason, and the little girl was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal again--cool, sure-footed, and keen</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the guidance of instinct.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The joyful shouts of the hunters reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">her ears.

When it is dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the village it is still light where Ruth</seg><seg type="columnLine">was.

Letting go, it rebounded and struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">her injured cheek. Again that blow! With</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pitiful cry the child made frantic pace up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocks, her bare foot leaving bloody</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A plaintive cry, child-like in its plead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, complaining treble, almost an echo of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of Ruth's, came from below her, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">far distant. Savage nostrils were hotly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sniffing the bloody little footprints.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Faintly up the mountain came a cry of</seg><seg type="columnLine">anguish from the distant depths. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice and tone were strange to Ruth; she</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard them not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Every muscle aching, chilled to the bone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reeling for a sudden want of sleep, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost baby staggered into a thicket and</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a fallen log. This log had lain</seg><seg type="columnLine">here for fifty years. Once it had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain king for a century: but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">npw decayed; and the black ants had eaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">out its heart till the log was a mere shell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut through in places on the underside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Unable to get under the obstruction, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacking strength to clamber over, Ruth felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">her way along it. Feeling slowly in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathering darkness, her little hands found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a warm, hairy mass.. It was a deer, sick</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a bullet-wound, and helpless because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the paralyzing fear caused by those</seg><seg type="columnLine">childlike cries from a savage throat so near.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Freezing, half naked as she was, little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ruth crowded close to this warm body lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside and partly beneath the lo", hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated a moment, then crawled close in be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the doe and the arching log. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sigh of relief, grateful for the warmth, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby snuggled close to the wounded animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wounded doe, her wildness overcome</seg><seg type="columnLine">by suffering, their mutual danger, and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinctive knowledge of coming death--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chill of whidi was already thickening</seg><seg type="columnLine">her blood--was thankful, too, for the pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence and the warmth of the child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two days before, the doc had returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fills very clump of bushes to find her</seg><seg type="columnLine">fawn, hidden not long before with all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cunning of a wild mother, gone. In its</seg><seg type="columnLine">place only a mass of bloody leaves, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">great daw marks scarred the log. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">keenest of noses told her that the yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">murderess still lingered,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One lacked a mother, the other an off-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring. In the night Ruth awoke. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">deer was trembling. Two lurid balls of</seg><seg type="columnLine">greenish-yellow fire burned a dozen feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">above them. Ruth, hungry, and with every</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerve stinging with pain, began to cry. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound of the human voice, again did</seg><seg type="columnLine">that horrid screech of the panther echo</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the mountains. A dark, supple</seg><seg type="columnLine">form slipped noiselessly as a shadow from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the limb overhead and disappeared; yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungered near.
