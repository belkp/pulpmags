D. Couzens. Before he died, Mr. Couzens was asked by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">book publisher to enlarge this story to book size. Always a conscientious</seg><seg type="columnLine">workman, he found that to increase its length beyond a certain mark weak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened the story, and he could not bring himself to do that. He was making</seg><seg type="columnLine">his long, game fight against slow disease, and the money from book publica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and the satisfaction of seeing his work in book form would have meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great deal to him. But he was too much a man and too much an artist to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prostitute his work, and he lost the chance of book publication.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He amplified the plot and increased the length by more than half. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">much he felt he could do without loss to the story and possibly with gain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He would not go further. Recently Mrs. Couzens asked us whether we</seg><seg type="columnLine">cared to buy the enlarged version of the story.

Because of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bond between them these were answered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Matthews, and lo, the picture was complete.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The key-scrolls fitted exactly into place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a grim picture of greed and passion</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the most desolate of island beaches, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a touch, here and there, of rather fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">heroism.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Matthews eventually told the tale with</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the finer details. He laughed at Wiggins'</seg><seg type="columnLine">story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course I provided for Joey," said he;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and took good care to tie his money up for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him so that he can only get at the interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">without my consent. Otherwise he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been rooked out of it in no time. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Wiggins, perhaps the old chap may not</seg><seg type="columnLine">think so, but he got more than he was en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">titled to. The shell was found before he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the charter. If any one had a claim on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearls it was the British Government; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I had told Wiggins and offered to share</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him, he would have taken them all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">claiming liis right under the charter. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">guano alone made him a fortune, and far</seg><seg type="columnLine">too dear a price had been paid for those</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearls for them to slip into his well-lined</seg><seg type="columnLine">pockets."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the listener agreed with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">their lowest estate--the inroads of life on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open beach being plainly visible.

Douchet, small, black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearded and shifty-eyed, was a French</seg><seg type="columnLine">anarchist, late of Noumea, the Government</seg><seg type="columnLine">prison of New Caledonia. Davison, loose-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lipped, flabby of jaw and grossly sensual,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a remittance-man; and Cox, a quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">rat of a man, whom Davison alternately</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullied and patronized, was of the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">invertebrate branch of the tribe of Ishmael.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The two had been cronies, in a way, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">years; but it was a friendship founded on</seg><seg type="columnLine">6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shiftlessness and sheer dread of loneliness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a poor thing at best.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These four were incompetents--incapa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bles--typical riffraff of the beach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fifth man was Tom Matthews, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">American, who still retained something of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heritage of lithe muscles, the address</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a gentleman, and, in spite of features</seg><seg type="columnLine">seamed with dissipation and weather, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of eyes clear and unwaveringly honest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His face might have been a trifle stronger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eyes a little less wistful and introspec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive ; and that they were not, may be taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some degree at least, as a reason for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence in the company.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were, at the moment, drinking up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last of Cox's small quarterly remittance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beyond that they were at the end of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">resources.

They were talking, somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">incoherently, of desperate measures; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Welsh and Douchet, to whom violence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crime had been an essential part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence, there was more in the talk than</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere drunken boasting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Welsh knew of a boat that might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolen--a large sailing-canoe.

Hayes had done it. So had</seg><seg type="columnLine">other men they could name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then there were traders at lonely stations</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the poisonous Solomons or the New</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hebrides who could be robbed with ease</seg><seg type="columnLine">and impunity. There were ways and means</seg><seg type="columnLine">that required no more than the taking of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sporting chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Matthews listened silently and with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing bitterness. In his present evil</seg><seg type="columnLine">case he had found the company of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, all as wretched as himself, a comfort,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for man is a gregarious animal; but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were times when his gorge rose at them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in disgust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He balked at theft and murder. Life</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone hard with him of late, but he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet come to that! He was still able,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he assured himself, to face the wholesome</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunrise with a fairly clean conscience,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though his self-respect was not what it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">once been.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four years before, while on a visit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">California, he had made one of a yachting-</seg><seg type="columnLine">party that started merrily and irrespon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibly from San Francisco for a cruise</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the South Seas. At Sydney he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to take a steamer back to California</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the yacht continued around the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had written the Girl back East about it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they were to be married when he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the yachting-party was composed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hare-brained spirits who devoted their ener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gies to draw-poker and strong drink. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">Honolulu their stay was only an elabora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the rioting aboard, and even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy morality of the beaches farther south</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shocked by the conduct of these wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">young men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That sort of thing is naturally bad for</seg><seg type="columnLine">discipline aboard a yacht and had its effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the officers and crew. The owner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yacht, who acted as his own sailing-master,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the most reckless spirit aboard; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disorder spread even to the forecastle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the result that the yacht was wrecked</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the Herveys with the loss of several</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives, nearly every soul aboard being drunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The survivors were eventually rescued</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went their several ways, disappearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with something of an air of mystery--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much chastened party of young men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom finally got to Honolulu, where he wrote</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Girl, telling what had happened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying that he was going home immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a brief rest ashore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But bad news has a way of traveling</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast. Most of the young men were of rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">and important families, and certain things</seg><seg type="columnLine">had appeared in the papers about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yachting-party and its ways at Honolulu;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in time there came a letter from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Girl--whose views on some subjects were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather pronounced---the burden of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that she would never marry an irrespon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible boy without one of the virtues of man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood, and a drunkard to boot. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very scathing letter and effectually put an</seg><seg type="columnLine">end to Tom's hopes; and he loved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Girl very much.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The worst of it was that Tom was in no</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to blame for the yacht's disastrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip. He had been disgusted with the state</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brethren of the Beach</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of affairs aboard from the first; had tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep a clear head; remonstrated with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions; and, as is usual in such cases,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought dislike and partial ostracism on</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in consequence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the final disaster he had shown a fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage that amounted to heroism, but an</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation to the Girl that he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">what she thought would have had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of an attempt to whitewash</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself at the expense of his companions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of whom had perished in the wreck;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was, therefore, left quite defense-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having considerable money, Tom re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained in Honolulu and plunged despair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly into a course of wildness that rivaled</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of the late yachting-party. This lasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some time. When his money was nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone he sent for more, only to find that</seg><seg type="columnLine">through certain intricate speculations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his trustees there was no more to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">had.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He then decided that there was nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">left for him at home, and with the remnant</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his funds took passage on a schooner</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound for the South Seas. At first he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">an effort to keep straight and do something</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth while. He took up such small em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ployments as he could find; but a man with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out money is as badly off among the islands</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a man without money anywhere else,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except that going to the dogs is a great deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">easier where the conventionalities are less</seg><seg type="columnLine">finely drawn and one has plenty of com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany. 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom worried more than was good for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him over the way the Girl had treated him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and little by little he began to lose hold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is the strong, bronzed men, ruthless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of initiative and lacking in conscientious</seg><seg type="columnLine">scruples, who draw the few prizes among</seg><seg type="columnLine">islands. Tom was of milder stuff. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">months and years went by and found him</seg><seg type="columnLine">an idler, simply drifting, through sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">inability to apply himself, a prey to morbid</seg><seg type="columnLine">loneliness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had tried petty clerkships, had sailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the mast, and set up as a trader;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in all he had failed. His natural inde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendence found clerking, under the British</seg><seg type="columnLine">system, only less obnoxious than the fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">castle of rancid, beetle- and roach-infested</seg><seg type="columnLine">copra-schooners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a trader he found pleasure in the rain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow-spanned valleys, the splendid sunsets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brown fishers on the reef and the ever-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">changing pictures painted with the raw</seg><seg type="columnLine">pigments of the tropics; but the loneliness</seg><seg type="columnLine">was appalling, and, as he was totally lacking</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the commercial instinct, the native?</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheated him shamelessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He never became reconciled to the mere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricious sham of island life, and it was with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, as it is with some, an easy drift into</seg><seg type="columnLine">oblivion. But, aside from this, his subse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quent career differed in no way from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of many others who have been spewed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the beaches,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found that his self-respect, which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had always cherished as above price, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no great asset, after all. He learned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponge for drinks as shamelessly as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oldest blue-nosed bummer on the beach,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to take pot-luck with the natives,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when nothing better served, without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">qualm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was not depraved or besotted. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was simply a matter of necessity on finding</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, for the first time in his life, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">need of the wherewithal to keep body and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made friends where he found them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">chiefly among remittance-men or men with</seg><seg type="columnLine">shady pasts. He had nothing to look for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward to and nothing particularly creditable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look back upon; but it is probable that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he retained more of the rags of his self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">respect than he knew. He was a beach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comber, a loafer and an outcast, but not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">complacent one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He might have ended, as many have, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">contented lotus-eater, with a dusky female</seg><seg type="columnLine">provider; but he despised the "squaw-men"</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the beaches, fatuously content with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">families of half-caste children; as he did the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dull, simple traders, hoarding away savings</seg><seg type="columnLine">against days of ease "back home." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">earned a dollar where he could, and, crav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing excitement, promptly spent it among</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chosen friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four years of this aimlessness had brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to the end of his tether, with the sick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening realization that he had thrown away</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best years of his life. To return home,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a penniless failure, with the stigma of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrecked yacht upon him, was not to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of. The warning he and his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions had received had touched the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">raw, quivering nerve of his latent pride; so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was with a sense of shame and</seg><seg type="columnLine">humiliation that he gulped down gin in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon and listened to the atrocious plotting</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the others.</seg><seg type="columnLine">8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CAPTAIN WIGGINS APPEARS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE door swung open, and a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered, walked to the bar and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaning on his elbow while he took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">general survey of the room. He was short</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pursy, with small, keen, gimlet-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, bulbous features and a long, grizzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard.

When Tom had risen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, and mentioned the name of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other applicant for the charter, he raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes and shot a keen glance at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">group about the table.

His nose was strongly</seg><seg type="columnLine">aquiline; his eyes steady, and so direct as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be almost disconcerting when the tired,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drooping eyelids were lifted. Around his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips there hovered perpetually the shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a mildly cynical, half-mocking smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As men grow to recognize and appraise</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other in an island community, Mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thews recognized this man as one of unques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned standing in the colony.

In addition to these as</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelters there were four tents, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">these were erected they built a large, open</seg><seg type="columnLine">lanai for a common living-room.

They were of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind known as baroques, and in the body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oyster was one tiny, round gem, perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">in form and color.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That day, and for many days thereafter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guano beds were neglected. The new</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupation of pearl-diving was taken up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with feverish enthusiasm. The sea-floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fairly paved with the great shell-fish,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the men dived and wrenched at them</seg><seg type="columnLine">till their lungs were bursting. They kept at</seg><seg type="columnLine">it till they were utterly exhausted and slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">like logs, often where they dropped on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open beach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  All took part till the shoal water had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared of shell and they were obliged to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work more systematically. The boat was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigged with a platform and diving-stones to</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight the divers, and the difficult work</seg><seg type="columnLine">began of bringing up shell from depths of</seg><seg type="columnLine">four fathoms and over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was hard and dangerous labor. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain upon the divers was prodigious; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were dangers, unseen and terrible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From one of these came their first trag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edy. Kuma, a Butaritari boy, was rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the surface, the air in his lungs exhausted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when one of the hideous snake-eels called</seg><seg type="columnLine">puhi-paka by the natives seized him by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand with its terrible jaws, armed with row</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon row of needle-sharp teeth, dragging his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm into a hole in the reef. Kanakas</seg><seg type="columnLine">dread the puhi more than they do the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shark, but:. they know how to meet his</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack.	...</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No human strength could break the grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the giant eel, but Kuma waited till the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster relaxed to get a fresh purchase with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tail, then shoved with all his strength and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tore away his mutilated hand. An instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">sooner and the lacerated hand would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been his only injury, but he had burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blood-vessel, and died that night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nevertheless the work went on. Steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">there grew row after row of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">oysters, high up on the beach, there to</seg><seg type="columnLine">"rot out" in the sun till the shells could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleaned of their contents. The bed was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparatively small one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In three weeks they had taken the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell. With a diving-armor it might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been done in as many days, but it covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very satisfying area of white beach as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they laid it out in the sun, and was a thing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for these men to gloat over and speculate</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dream about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They lay about when the work was done,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nursing salt-water sores and various wounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bruises. They were a very tired com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany, but their attitude toward life and</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other had changed. They were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer broken men, delving in the guano for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Wiggins; they were men of sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance, owners of a bed of shell, the aristo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cratic holding of the Pacific. They could</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop in at any port, show a pocketful of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearls and an air of mystery and be pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out as men of note. The tainted air from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rotting shell was laden with optimism.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The question before the house is: "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Wiggins?" said Matthews.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, wot about Wiggins?" growled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Welsh.

There may be a fortune there in</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearls--and then there may not; but what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever there is, give Wiggins a hint and he'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">hog the whole business, to say nothing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shell."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hah!" said Douchet.

"Those boys are bound to chum with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wiggins' Kanaka crew, and what they tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be told aft, be sure of that. Then it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">good-by pearls!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Welsh looked at the Kanakas and</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightened up. His fingers began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">twitch, and gradually a strange expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">came over his face. One corner of his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew up, and his little eyes took on an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression of cunning ferocity that could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be mistaken. Effingham laughed outright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Oh, come, Reddy," said he; "we're not</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to kill off the boys yet awhile. Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they've done all the hard work! We'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to organize, that's all. It's a simple matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "As for that shell, it's worth two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars a ton at Shanghai.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">"square-face" of gin stood within reach of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand, and he gulped down a swallow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose wearily and slipped his bare feet into</seg><seg type="columnLine">straw sandals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was gray dawn. The trade wind ha,d</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet risen, and the sea rolled lazily at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the barrier reef. No one was stir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring on the beach, but as he passed Effing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham's tent he heard a hollow, racking cough</seg><seg type="columnLine">within. Effingham had been failing fast of</seg><seg type="columnLine">late, and his cough had grown steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stoical young Englishman never</seg><seg type="columnLine">alluded to himself or his ailment and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have railed at any spoken sympathy, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Tom looked round the lonely islet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleaker than ever in the gray of morning,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the pathos and tragedy of it struck him like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God!" he muttered. "What a place to</seg><seg type="columnLine">die in!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An eighth of a mile away an acre or so of</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach was covered with the shell in the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess of "rotting out," and the poisonous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">festering mass smelled to high heaven. Day</seg><seg type="columnLine">and night, unabated by rain or wind, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful odor hung like a pall--ubiquitous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">intolerable--dominating even the snuffy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pungent ammonia smell of the guano. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">night the mass emitted a pale, shimmering</seg><seg type="columnLine">phosphorescence; by day, under the hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun, the air above it shuddered in phantas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">magoric waves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Matthews made a detour round the shell</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned inland across a low plateau.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were birds in countless legions. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">crude nests cumbered the ground. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled the air and dotted the surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea. Huge albatrosses, fierce-eyed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scornful, lumbered grudgingly out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Somber frigate-birds, with crimson</seg><seg type="columnLine">pouches at their throats, hissed and snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him truculently, while clouds of gulls</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smaller birds took protesting flight, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">settle again as he passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reached the windward side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island and threw himself at full length on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rocky eminence overlooking the sea.

Filled with new resolutions, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned with impatience to put them into</seg><seg type="columnLine">practise. He was going to reestablish his</seg><seg type="columnLine">manhood--to think of himself once more by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ambiguous word "gentleman" without</seg><seg type="columnLine">flinching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was young and there was still a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance.

Divided</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them all it might mean no more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trifle for each. However small his share,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom intended to put it to good use, and, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not have at once those things that</seg><seg type="columnLine">represented the amenities of life, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">find a way to them eventually.</seg><seg type="columnLine">22</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had brooded too long over a woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had thrown him over unfairly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never forget her--her memory would</seg><seg type="columnLine">always be a scar--but he would make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh start in spite of it. He had quite re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered from the feeling of loneliness with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had been stricken after having</seg><seg type="columnLine">impulsively flung away the locket, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rejoiced to be free from that last link which</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound him with the past.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Regarding the pearls Tom found plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cause for uneasiness. He reviewed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">individual traits of his companions, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained attitude toward each other and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smoldering hostility and distrust that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had grown through being so long together</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this lonely place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four of the men were either actual or po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tential criminals. Effingham, though Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinctively trusted him, was an enigma</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all that; and his sinister and pessimistic</seg><seg type="columnLine">allusions whenever the pearls were men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned, coming as they did from a dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, were disturbing. It seemed inevitable</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, if many pearls were found, trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">would follow in so mixed and uncongenial</seg><seg type="columnLine">a company.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Uneasy and depressed, Tom walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly back across the island. No one was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at work on the guano beds. The Kanakas</seg><seg type="columnLine">were off fishing on the reef, and the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were sitting about on the beach or</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandering nervously around the vicinity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In spite of their compact the temptation</seg><seg type="columnLine">to probe at the oysters, fast growing leath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery and shriveled in the sun, was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">irresistible. The square-face was passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">freely. Even Welsh, the stolid giant, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">visibly nervous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My word!" said he, wiping his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a huge paw. "I wish that stinkin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">mess was cleaned up. Suppose a ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">should 'appen in now, with all that shell</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid out. It would be cruel 'ard to be stuck</seg><seg type="columnLine">up for all that swag, mates!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Effingham winked at Tom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen to the lion roar!" said he.

"No lack of spirit in Frenchy here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I should like to see a man's heart cut out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It must be curious."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's no need to borrow that kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble," said Tom. "We haven't seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sail in three months, and there's none</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming. We're too far off the track."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't be too sure, my son."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Effingham rolled a cigaret with a quick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">deft twist of finger and thumb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Things usually happen at the wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">time.

Let's have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small game to work up an appetite."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They gathered in the lanai and began a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather desultory game of poker. Long</seg><seg type="columnLine">association had made each man's style of</seg><seg type="columnLine">play familiar to the others. Cox was cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tious and timid, uncertain of a good hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless stimulated by drink; Davison rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolid and consistent for so mercurial</seg><seg type="columnLine">a game as poker. He played a far better</seg><seg type="columnLine">game of whist. Welsh was blunderingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">aggressive, with strong oaths when luck</seg><seg type="columnLine">went against him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Douchet, throughout a game, sat tense</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nervous, plucking at his pointed black</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard, his mean little close-set eyes alight</seg><seg type="columnLine">with avarice. He snatched at his winnings</seg><seg type="columnLine">greedily, and it was understood that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would cheat when possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Effingham, by far the best player, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">indifferent to the game and unruffled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">winnings or losses; but his slim fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">manipulated the cards with the skill of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">born gambler, and he invariably won at</seg><seg type="columnLine">any game they chose to play.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom played the fair, average game of</seg><seg type="columnLine">most Americans when the game is draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">poker, but it had long ceased to interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He was weary of the greed of Welsh</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Douchet, the babbled obscenities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Davison and Cox's eternal grin and whining</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. Yet he played when the others did,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the game was a relief from mental stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It lacked intrinsic interest, for there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to play for. They had staked their</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospective pay from Wiggins so often, bor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowing and reborrowing, that it haci grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a hopeless jumble of accounts that no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one attempted to straighten out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They now played for chips made of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brethren of the Beach</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs of trees of different-colored woods</seg><seg type="columnLine">sawed into thin discs. These had a purely</seg><seg type="columnLine">chimerical value of twenty-five cents, fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">cents and a dollar each, according to color,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the values being represented by sandalwood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hau and kou woods, respectively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They played till meal-time. The game</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged, but they were all in good humor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for the time they warmed toward each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other and expanded into something like</seg><seg type="columnLine">geniality. It struck Matthews with a glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of surprize and made him rather ashamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his uneasy suspicions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From their present attitude one would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have thought them the best comrades in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. They were all, in fact, building air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">castles with foundations of pearls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the meal they resumed the game by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light of smoky lanterns, but presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">Welsh threw down his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Blow the cards!" said he. "Let's chuck</seg><seg type="columnLine">it!

He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a fine schooner, seized for debt, that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly rotting at the dock in Auckland, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be bought dirt cheap. Davison was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going "home" with the sole idea of disgrac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the father who had turned him off with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pittance to shift for himself in the colo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nies.

There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were times when she found Dorothy posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively unsympathetic, and the good lady's &lt;</seg><seg type="columnLine">matutinal recitals of her "symptoms" of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night before were received with actual in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference. Dorothy was distraught, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">little worry lines began to appear around</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes and mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jack Holloway came often and they spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">much time in close communion. Shortly</seg><seg type="columnLine">after his first visit a notice had appeared in</seg><seg type="columnLine">various California papers offering a reward</seg><seg type="columnLine">for information concerning the whereabouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Matthews, and later, at Holloway's sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestion, in the journals of Australia and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Far East.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorothy scanned her daily mail eagerly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hopefully till a couple of months had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone by without result. She admitted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was an impertinence for her to try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">24</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">communicate with Matthews, and really</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed she was acting purely from motives</seg><seg type="columnLine">of justice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was hardly probable that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever care to see her again after her scathing</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter of four years before, every word of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was burned in her memory, and if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had suddenly appeared before her she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been at a loss to explain her recrudes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent interest in his welfare; but she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">acting on Holloway's suggestion to com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">municate with Tom, if possible, and "square</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself" for her conscience's sake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If he were living he would have ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">his life anew on other lines. There would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be other women, one of whom had perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him happy--other scenes and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">interests.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was prompted, she believed, solely</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the desire to acknowledge her fault in</seg><seg type="columnLine">having misjudged him, in the same spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which Holloway had come to her with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his story. She wondered if he would scorn</seg><seg type="columnLine">her; or if he would be kind and look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, a little reproachfully perhaps, with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">honest, sentimental gray eyes, as he used</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to do, and--and-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Here Dorothy would become very</seg><seg type="columnLine">wretched indeed, and she and Holloway</seg><seg type="columnLine">would drag her aunt, protesting, to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">theater and a late supper, where the older</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady would have a most enjoyable time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of herself and forget all about clinical</seg><seg type="columnLine">thermometers and "symptoms" for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time being.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Auntie," said Dorothy one morning at</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast, "I know the very best thing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world for you.

Please wait till I get my hat."</seg><seg type="columnLine">They drove to town and then to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wharf, Dorothy stopping on the way and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing from the bank a large sum of money</seg><seg type="columnLine">in gold. In the cabin of the Mamaloa</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the mate was in the midst of a recital con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">firming the captain's description of Mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thews, when Wiggins suddenly struck his</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead a violent blow with his knuckles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God bless me!" he cried. "What an ass</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am; I had clean forgot! Just a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">miss!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He disappeared into his own room, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning presently with a small, clear snap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot photograph. It was one taken by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Effingham on the way to the island. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed a group of six men, one of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Wiggins; another, barefooted, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn pajamas, whom Dorothy recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once as Tom Matthews.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked at the picture long and ear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nestly. In the pitiless fashion of snap-shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">photographs it accentuated the haggard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">careworn expression and dissipated lines in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faces of the subjects. Except for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolid Wiggins, sternly posing on his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter-deck, the photo showed unsparingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rakish, tatterdemalion group of nonde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scripts in which Matthews himself appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">without advantage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorothy laid the picture down with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sigh. Then she opened her hand-bag and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dumped the contents on the table. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shining heap of gold she counted out</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten ten-dollar pieces and gave them to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you!" she said. "I am quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leaving the rest of the gold lying before</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, she fell to studying the photograph</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. The heap of gold remaining on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table was of a size to make Captain Wiggins</seg><seg type="columnLine">lick his lips. He was looking at it as a cat</seg><seg type="columnLine">might eye a cream-jug when Dorothy raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Captain," she asked, "do you ever carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, ma'am," said Wiggins promptly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Only down among the islands, that is--</seg><seg type="columnLine">not regular passengers.

The un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainty of the pearl-fisher's trade makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">it one of the most fascinating in the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aside from the valuable shell itself every</seg><seg type="columnLine">oyster represents a potential fortune.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a whole bed there may not be one pearl</seg><seg type="columnLine">of value; in another may lie hidden a king's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ransom.

There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">four, indeed, of a bigness and luster beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">any they had ever seen. But there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">many others, for the bed had proved of</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible richness, and they ranged from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the four in a graduated scale down to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scant handful of irregular baroques.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom gazed with fascination at the softly</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing heap in the calabash. His chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">for rehabilitation lay before him, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood surged faster through his pulses. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">past seemed to fall away from him and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future to rise and welcome him, so that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dominant feeling was a longing for action</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some kind to try out his dormant muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stir the kinks out of his brain. Psycho-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">logically it was the same sensation that</seg><seg type="columnLine">prompted Welsh's desire to get drunk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Effingham fingered the gems coolly</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough; but his eyes had an unwonted</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightness, and there was a glowing, hectic</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot on each cheek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Emblems of trouble," said he propheti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally. "I'm almost sorry there are so many.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If we weren't such a mild-mannered, gentle</seg><seg type="columnLine">flock of lambs there might be some throat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting over these.

Why not bury</seg><seg type="columnLine">them till Wiggins gets back?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Effingham looked at him with a sudden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">contemptuous fierceness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "1'here's no need of any delusions about</seg><seg type="columnLine">our all being gentlemen and men of honor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fact is we're a crew of pretty hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">characters. If we bury these every one</seg><seg type="columnLine">will want to know where, naturally. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">what's to hinder any one of us privately</seg><seg type="columnLine">digging them up and planting them some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where else? No, there's only one thing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These pearls, as they stand, represent</seg><seg type="columnLine">money--a lump sum. Money can be evenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">divided; these can not. Let the man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">holds the balance of trust take charge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them till they can be disposed of and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal division made of the money they</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring. Otherwise there's going to be a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dissension, and that means--trouble!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Good idea, that," said Davison. "W^'H</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw cuts for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That won't do, boys," said Effingham</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brethren of the Beach</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">27</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">emphatically. "I said the man who holds</seg><seg type="columnLine">the balance of trust. We can't leave that</seg><seg type="columnLine">to chance. We must vote for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This led to a prolonged and heated dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussion. It was quite evident that with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exception of Effingham none of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">party cared to see the pearls in the hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any one but himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If we put them in the hands of one man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you say," said Cox, "what's to hinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from burying them on his own account?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fat chance the rest of us would have then."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I spoke of one man digging them up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and transplanting them in case we buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">them together. We might never find out</seg><seg type="columnLine">who did it. In this case we know the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">beforehand, and if at any time he failed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce the pearls on demand--well, I guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'd know what to do. Our treasurer will</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk with his life in his hands, gentlemen!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">To Matthews the arrangement seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fairest possible, and he joined his argu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments to Effingham's. After some further</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrangling the plan was agreed upon. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrote their votes on the margin of a leaf</seg><seg type="columnLine">from an old paper novel and tossed them</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the calabash; but the result of the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">ballot was ludicrous. Tom and Effingham</seg><seg type="columnLine">had each voted for the other; the rest had</seg><seg type="columnLine">all voted for themselves. Matthews laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in spite of the gravity of the occasion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Vote's a tie," said he. "Come again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentlemen!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One moment," said Effingham mildly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost pleadingly. "Don't think I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do all of the talking, but I do want one</seg><seg type="columnLine">word before we vote again. Of course this</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be easily settled in the long run. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">only idea is to keep the pearls together in</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe hands, so there will be no jawing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowing over them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The only way is to have the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable man in charge. He has got to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clear head and be ready to fight some</seg><seg type="columnLine">discontented idiot at any time to protect</seg><seg type="columnLine">his trust. Any one of us can put up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight, I guess; and any one of us can let the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gin alone--" he looked hard at Cox and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Davison--"but my candidate is Tom Mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thews because he can do both as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of us and, being a sort of new chum on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beach, is probably a little more trust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worthy than the rest of us. That's all."</seg><seg type="columnLine">This time there were two votes for Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">against one for every one but Cox. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">irresolute and timid member had dodged</seg><seg type="columnLine">the responsibility in favor of Tom. There</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was a snarl from Douchet and a curse from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Welsh as the result was announced, and Cox</seg><seg type="columnLine">cringed a trifle, looking dubious as if he half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">regretted his choice. But there was no fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther demonstration, though as Tom made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pearls into a temporary packet he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched hungrily by several pairs of eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a little thrill ran up and down his spine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He had anticipated trouble, and now if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came he would be the storm-center; but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of responsibility fired him with new</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-confidence and determination. It was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt, the first move in his rehabilitation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It satisfied in a measure his craving for</seg><seg type="columnLine">action. With the feel of the pearls against</seg><seg type="columnLine">his skin the world seemed once more a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">good one to live in, and with a light heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">he set about making an oilskin pouch for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gems.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY gathered in the lanai to cele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brate the holiday in the proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit. It was the first day since</seg><seg type="columnLine">their arrival that they actually shirked</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, but all thought of labor was put aside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were bursting with animal spirits.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They ransacked their supplies for the few</seg><seg type="columnLine">luxuries in store.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They shot plover on the reef, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kanakas gathered fish, ti-root and plan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains, which they cooked in an imu, under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. Davison resurrected the guitar and</seg><seg type="columnLine">concertina and extracted weird melody un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reproached. And, having feasted, they lav</seg><seg type="columnLine">about at ease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "-love us!" said Welsh, leaning back</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">luxuriously and puffing at a black, moldy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Manila cigar. "But it's good to be rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tyke it h'easy after sweatin' the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">we 'ave for a few shillin's from that bloke</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wiggins.

"What we want is to get safely</seg><seg type="columnLine">away with the pearls. Still, we've earned a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good loaf.

They can fmish the job in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple of weeks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That wouldn't be fair to the beys,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied Matthews. "They've worked hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and faithfully, and they're trusting us now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a lot of children, for a share in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearls. What do you think, Walt?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned to Effingham, who was leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his tent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To tell the truth, Tommie," said he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lazily, "I don't give a hang one way or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. Good night!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom emptied the pearls into the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted pouch and hung it round his neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a strand of coconut fibre.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said he, "I admit I'm rather keen</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a spell of loafing, myself. It's under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood then that we've thrown up Wiggins'</seg><seg type="columnLine">job?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one answered. Four pairs of eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were focused on the pouch hanging from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his neck. While none of those eyes, red and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watery from drink, held any actual hos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tility toward himself, they had a common</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression of avarice, and in that glance he</seg><seg type="columnLine">read the full responsibility of his steward-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. It weighed heavily on him, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed a restless night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once or twice he fancied he heard whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pering outside his tent, and on one occasion</seg><seg type="columnLine">he rose and peered out.

Why had Effingham</seg><seg type="columnLine">done this without consulting him? Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">this a guardover him?

That he would fail to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">render a just accounting was absurd; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride fairly bristled at the thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Effingham had forced the thing on him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that ridiculous election, and then set a</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch on him! The man valued him no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than he did the rest, and the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">pother was over a few trinkets of no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">value at the moment than so many pebbles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He opened the pouch and looked at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearls.

Play-</seg><seg type="columnLine">things for elves and fairies--and Douchet's</seg><seg type="columnLine">talons and Welsh's hairy paws would snatch</seg><seg type="columnLine">at them to squander in nameless debauch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eries!

All his uneasiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystallized into a feeling of bitter indigna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and disgust, and he threw down his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and went in search of Effingham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER X</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TOLD IN CONFIDENCE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T_T E FOUND him in a little clearing close</seg><seg type="columnLine">A A to where a small spring bubbled up</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the stones.

He could do interesting and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mysterious things with cards, coins and bits</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of string, make perfect splices with rope,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and bring down a drinking coconut by sev-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ering the stem with a single cast of a sharp</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stone or a shot from his revolver.

Behind them</seg><seg type="columnLine">squatted the Kanakas, born gamblers at</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart, fascinated by the tensity of the game</seg><seg type="columnLine">and criticizing the play in whispers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Douchet won the first pot. He played</seg><seg type="columnLine">most card games well, but his Gallic tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perament interfered with his proficiency at</seg><seg type="columnLine">poker.

With the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearls before their eyes each played a close,</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful game, and the taut strain of excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment lasted from beginning to end. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no songs and only such conversation</seg><seg type="columnLine">as applied to the game. They were sparing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of drinks at first, but toward morning their</seg><seg type="columnLine">last case of gin was broached and a bottle</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed beside each man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When any one laughed it was high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitched and nervous.

I'm playing for those four pearls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reddy, if I can get them; but you've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than enough chips yourself; why not</seg><seg type="columnLine">take one, too?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was a "bluff" on Effingham's part, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it sufficed.

Welsh was obliged to meet it with his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">own pearl in order to call, and Effingham</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">took the pot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was a lengthy argument at this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the contention being that it took too many</seg><seg type="columnLine">chips out of circulation and that a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">should not cash in unless he wished to with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw. Effingham settled the debate by</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly putting back the pearls and taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You fellows are perfectly correct," said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he.

Instantly Welsh shoved his</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole pile forward, picked up his gin bottle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drank a full half-pint of the raw spirit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without waiting for Tom to bet, Douchet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a laugh that was almost a scream,</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw his own chips in and reached out</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands like grapples, ready to scoop in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pot, his eyes gloating on the calabashes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pearls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold on, Frenchy!

When Tom had secured</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pearls he helped Joey get the sick man</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his bunk and sat with him till Effingham</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">recovered from his fainting spell and fell into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">normal sleep. Then Tom went to his own</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tent and lay down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Body and brain had reached the limit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of endurance. It occurred to him that he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ought to find a hiding-place for the pearls at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">once, but he was too exhausted to make the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">effort. Just as he was falling asleep Joey,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">who had stationed himself outside with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a rifle, put his head in through the flap of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the tent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Tomi," said he, "I stop here outside;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">maybe bimeby tired I 'fraid I moemoe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">(sleep). Then I speak Keola, he come."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "All right, Joey," said Tom drowsily;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"now clear out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And immediately he lost consciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He awoke in the pitch darkness that pre-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cedes dawn, his senses tingling and alert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He could see absolutely nothing, but some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing was moving inside the tent. Some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing that breathed heavily was stealthily</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crawling toward his bunk! He had taken</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the precaution to keep Effingham's revolver</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strapped to his wrist by the leather thong,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and it fell naturally into his palm as he rose</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to a sitting posture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Is that you, Joey?" he called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was no reply. Instinctively he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clutched at his breast. The pearls were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gone! At the instant of discovery he fired in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the direction of the sound, and by the flash</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">saw a form rising from the ground and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a livid face with a knife in its teeth. Be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fore he could fire again he was grappling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with a snarling, rabid creature that sprang</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at him bodily and clutched his throat. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">knew it was Douchet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man was panting with hate and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">passion, and though Tom was far stronger</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and heavier, for a moment the Frenchman</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had him at a disadvantage. He stabbed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">viciously with the knife, and by sheer luck</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tom parried the blow with his arm and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">caught Douchet by the wrist. The French-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man's teeth sank into his other arm and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tom staggered, missed his footing and fell</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">backward, carrying the tent with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Both he arid Douchet were still struggling,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but they were soon involved in the folds of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the tent and practically helpless. Tom</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wriggled and fought with the heavy canvas</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to free himself, when he felt some one haul-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing at it from the outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Presently he spun round in the folds; the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tent came away clear, and he was lying on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his back blinking at a light shining in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">36</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. Davison stood near, holding a lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tern, while Welsh, who had tom away the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent, towered over him, his eyes bloodshot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ablaze with ferocity. Douchet who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had tumbled sprawling out of the folds, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Near by, lying on its back, its arms out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread in the form of a crucifix, lay the dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of Keola, the Hawaiian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Welsh fell upon Tom and pinned him</seg><seg type="columnLine">down.

But his arm was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aching from Douchet's bite, the giant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure was merely spectral in the dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of the lantern, and the shot went wide.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Welsh reached him with a bound, tore the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon from his grasp, and struck him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fist, full in the face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom did not wholly lose consciousness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He felt himself being trussed up in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion and then dragged bodily along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground as they dragged sacks of guano.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He smelled the sickish odor of trade gin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a warm liquor flooded his mouth and burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lips and, gasping and coughing, he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his senses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was sitting under a tree, his back</seg><seg type="columnLine">against it.

Davison, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light, was holding a gin-bottle to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips. Douchet stood by, the bare knife in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand, and in the rear Cox hovered, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">erubescent nose gleaming on a face as white</seg><seg type="columnLine">as chalk, his smile gone for once, and anx-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iety and fear in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond the circle of light it was pitch</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark; but far off on the horizon, just barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible, was the first thin streak of dawn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The palms creaked and bent in the strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind, and the air was dank and sodden with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the approaching storm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inland the birds rustled and chattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneasily, and Tom could hear from Effing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham's tent the sick man's steady, tearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">cough. His mind registered these impres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions vaguely, for he was still dazed, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms ached horribly from the tension on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thumbs. Welsh gave the ropes a jerk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Stand up!" said he harshly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was drunk and swaying on his feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a terrible figure of primitive passion and</seg><seg type="columnLine">power. Tom rose in response to his tug at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Matthews, where are those pearls?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know.

You can't 'ave all that swag to</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself. Do you squeal?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom ground his teeth and his eves blazed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he made no reply. Welsh gathered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ropes and hauled viciously. Tom was</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked almost clear of the ground, every</seg><seg type="columnLine">joint from thumb to shoulder seeming to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rend apart. His eyes started from his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the sweat broke out all over his body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pulses in his head drummed frantically</seg><seg type="columnLine">and waves of red fluid seemed flowing over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyeballs. There was a sudden dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound, and, as if from a blow, Welsh leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air, then plunged headforemost into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no sound of a shot; nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stirred apparently, and excepting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind in the trees it was so still that Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear the ceaseless coughing of Effing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham in Ills tent. The taut ropes relaxed;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom's arms fell to his side, quite benumbed;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he fumbled helplessly at the ropes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">release himself. Douchet stood facing him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an instant with a startled expression,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, snarling like a wild beast, he leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Tom, his knife in his hand, his arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised to strike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blow never fell. Tom heard a soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">thud, something like the impact of a man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tist on a sack of meal; the Frenchman threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his arms with a gurgling cry; his whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">body went limp and he collapsed in a heap,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie writhed spasmodically for a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then lay still. A heavy knife was buried in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ribs, the hilt protruding beneath his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom with his own knife cut the ropes</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his hands and ankles, sprang forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and snatched the revolver from Welsh's</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt. Davison stood stupefied, his flabby</seg><seg type="columnLine">jowls hanging and his eyes staring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Welsh rolled over and sat up. He felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of his head dazedly, and his hand came</seg><seg type="columnLine">away covered with blood.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was tall, and very broad and powerful of</seg><seg type="columnLine">physique. His forehead was wide, the hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray about the temples, and his eyes deep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunken and of a cold, steely blue. He wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">white duck trousers, canvas shoes, carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe-clayed, and a blue serge jacket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glanced about him shrewdly with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">masterful air of self-possession.

As the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man stepped ashore Effingham gripped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ajm, his fingers like steel bands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's the man," said he in a tense</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper. "That's Commodore Frawley!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom surveyed the visitor with interest as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he walked toward him on the beach. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a man whose name had supplied elabo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate material for gossip in various parts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world. The black sheep of an excellent</seg><seg type="columnLine">family who had long since repudiated him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had led a wayward and checkered exist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence as a sailor on the Great Lakes, news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper man, card-sharp and swindler, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">various other forms of activity. His pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture adorned the Rogues' Gallery in New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York City.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At forty-five, polished, suave, a manly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and attractive figure, he had put through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowning achievement, which consisted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquiring by a partial payment one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">finest schooner yachts in Gravesend Bay</seg><seg type="columnLine">and promoting a fantastic scheme for tour-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out-of-the-way parts of the world with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">party of writers and artists who were sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to produce material to be sold for</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast sums to newspaper syndicates and</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He organized a company to equip the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yacht with essentials and luxuries and bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the expenses of this extraordinary cruise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which spoke well for his ability as a pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moter, for the project was more or less</seg><seg type="columnLine">chimerical and would never have held</seg><seg type="columnLine">water under proper investigation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once beyond the three-mile limit, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the master's papers in his pocket, Frawley</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgot all about the company, except to</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw upon it for large sums until the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany grew wary and finally withdrew its</seg><seg type="columnLine">support. The artists were dropped at</seg><seg type="columnLine">near-by ports; and Frawley, with the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany's money, began a piratical cruise of</seg><seg type="columnLine">three years which led him around the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">and eventually to the South Seas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had flown commodore and vice-com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">modore flags of well-known yacht clubs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">regardless of the Yachting Register, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus earned the title of commodore, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had never held any executive office in</seg><seg type="columnLine">any yacht club. He had been received, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">virtue of letters furnished by the company,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the most exclusive clubs in the civilized</seg><seg type="columnLine">ports of the world and maintained himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yacht and its crew, by gambling and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">promotion of numerous swindling enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prises. He had a system of "cappers,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with his own personality he found easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">prey among the gullible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the thing could not last. At the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of three years his doings had attained a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide publicity, and he found it impossible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">return on his tracks or make a port the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second time without finding trouble await-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him. Then the toils closed in on him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the yacht was finally seized at Auckland</seg><seg type="columnLine">under attachment and sold for more igno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minious uses than a gentleman's cruiser.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such was the audacity of Frawley that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">eventually bought the yacht for a song</seg><seg type="columnLine">through an agent, and turned his undoubted</seg><seg type="columnLine">talents into the hodge-podge scramble for</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars in the South Seas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had promoted schemes for planting</seg><seg type="columnLine">cacao and vanilla in Samoa, and was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">active, working member of an influential</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese firm in Canton which was inti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mately concerned in island enterprise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They bought copra, pearls and btcke-de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vier, had a small fleet of schooners in trade;</seg><seg type="columnLine">40</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and of these and other activities "Commo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dore" Frawley was the guiding spirit. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of a bluff heartiness and geniality of</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner, it was said thatjio way of making</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dollar was too mean or dishonorable for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his consideration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRAWLEY came briskly along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach, his muscular hands thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the pockets of his coat, puffing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the stub of his cigar. Tom noted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crew of the whale-boat carried rifles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frawley cast a shrewd glance at the pearl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell, round which there still clung the</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful odor of rotten oysters, and sniffed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air daintily as Tom and Welsh came</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward to meet him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How are you, gentlemen?" said he.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nice place you have here, but I wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">recommend it as a health resort.

"I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">here on official business, but I'll take a drink</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you.

The impending storm was at hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the brown mist was sweeping closer</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the sea.

His nerves and brain were be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbed through reaction, and he was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">overwhelmed with lassitude that he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">it impossible to marshal his thoughts into</seg><seg type="columnLine">any sort of sequence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Effingham had been right about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearls.

Stretch a line from one to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, and fifteen feet from the rock is the place I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have chosen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tommie, I'm stepping off into the dark with no</seg><seg type="columnLine">faith, no creed, and, I am afraid, no contrition.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have accomplished what I came to do and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a vast curiosity to see what the rest is like.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet if there are any presiding deities, as we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">taught and try to believe, I trust they will help and</seg><seg type="columnLine">guide you and bring you to your own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Aloha Walter Effingham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom choked as he read the message; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flood of weakness overcame him, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay with his face in his arms on the green</seg><seg type="columnLine">turf, and sobbed like a child. The letter</seg><seg type="columnLine">was characteristic, not of Effingham, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandoned stoic who viewed life with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaundiced eye and a smile of derision, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom he had sailed from Suva; but the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had just learned to know, of purpose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">principle, whose stoicism was a mere cloak</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the fine sentiment underneath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So strong had his personality been that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the familiar spot, with the letter in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, Tom could almost feel his presence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He carefully folded the letter and put it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pocket. The two marks mentioned were</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinct and unmistakable, and he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">them at a glance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat there for hours, thinking, the pulses</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his forehead throbbing and his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">aching incessantly. Only three days before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had sat on this very spot arguing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his companions about the trusteeship of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearls. Now they were all dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was the last of these ill-assorted breth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ren of the beach, and he owed it to Effing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham that he was not lying stark with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. Effingham had understood! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stood behind Matthews from first to</seg><seg type="columnLine">last, and Tom owed him not only life but</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortune.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But why had Effingham given him a pack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">et of pebbles? That this was a hoax Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not conceive; it had been done with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deep purpose, and had a bearing on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enigmatical smile of the dying man and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">remark about having guessed right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Could he, with his weird intuition, have</seg><seg type="columnLine">foreseen what had actually taken place?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom tried to adjust his mind to follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">Effingham's intricate reasoning, but it led</seg><seg type="columnLine">him nowhere. He was certain, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the pearls would turn up at the proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He sought out Joey and told him of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Effingham's posthumous request, and to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether they prepared the body for burial.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pearls were not on Effingham's person,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor were they to be found in the hiding-</seg><seg type="columnLine">place under the matting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">48</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">As they bore him to the spring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowy smile on the dead man's lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to Tom to have the same intui-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive understanding behind it that it had in</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. Tom stretched the line, measured off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distance and broke the ground at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Directly under the sod the pick struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tin tobacco-box. Tom cleared it of earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but laid it aside until he had finished his</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty toward his friend. Then he sat down</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the spring and with shaking fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the box. The top was stuffed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">bits of cloth; but underneath, glowing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft, beautiful luster, lay the pearls. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">them was a slip of paper with a brief note:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">No. 1.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tommie: Here find your property. You've</seg><seg type="columnLine">already found the pebbles, of course.

It's a waste of</seg><seg type="columnLine">time and sympathy, and sometimes has fatal</seg><seg type="columnLine">results.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the bottom of the box was a packet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">very neatly made of an old chamois to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bacco-bag, faultlessly stitched with fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">thread. In this were the four large pearls</seg><seg type="columnLine">and another note:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">No. 2.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I've tried to fix this all in decency and order so</seg><seg type="columnLine">it will work out right in the end.

Tomorrow, or next day at most, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Joey would put to sea. They would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gone before, but Tom had hung on</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a faint hope that something might turn</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">up. He had no chart or compass, and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even a general knowledge of the distribu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion or distance of the inhabited islands</seg><seg type="columnLine">north of the line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wiggins was long overdue, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly probable that he would ever return.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was not the man to sail his schooner all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way from Honolulu, if Frawley had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">charter for working the island, for the mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of taking off a handful of beach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comber workmen. Still, there was always</seg><seg type="columnLine">the remote chance that he might come, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">that some other vessel, possibly a gunboat or</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruiser, would happen in and take them off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joey and he had carefully rehearsed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">story to account for the disappearance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others. This concerned an epidemic of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickness following the row with Frawley</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his men, and Tom had polished and</seg><seg type="columnLine">revised it and smoothed off the rough edges</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make it entirely plausible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Frawley episode would have to go as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it stood. Frawley had actually been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aggressor by firing the first shot, and Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to take a chance on that against</seg><seg type="columnLine">any story that the survivors on the schooner</seg><seg type="columnLine">might tell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had cleared the beach of the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestige of pearl-shell, sinking it far out in</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep water, and Tom wore the pearls in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a belt around his waist. There appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing further to be done except put to sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">and trust to luck. Somewhere to the north,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom knew, was the lane of the ocean liners.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once in that they had a fair chance of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The birds were all gone, and Tom missed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their noisy chattering and bustle. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence had become ghastly and unbearable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A dozen times a day Tom harked to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancied hail from one of his late compan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ions, and as often at night he awoke in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold sweat from some nightmare of murder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and violence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without Joey he thought he should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone mad. The Kanaka boy was a jewel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">faithful, kind and constantly cheerful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thowgh Tom had often to suppress his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendency to dwell on rather grisly Polyne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sian superstitions concerning the dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They leaned upon each other for support</seg><seg type="columnLine">like two children in the dark. As for Joey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Kanaka simplicity he had transferred</seg><seg type="columnLine">his allegiance to Tom, and would have fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed him cheerfully to the ends of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth like the faithful Friday of beloved</seg><seg type="columnLine">legend.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brethren of the Beach</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">r49</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A shadow fell athwart his face, and Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up.

His heart leaped at the sight, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he held the glass on them a long time for</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear it might be some ship passing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">random. At the end of half an hour all</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubts were settled. The schooner, running</seg><seg type="columnLine">free, was bearing down on the island. Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang to his feet and grasped Joey's hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Joey, you old son-of-a-gun," he cried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"make a noise! Do something, man!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cheer, confound you! That's old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wiggins!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The schooner was bowling along with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fair wind and a bone in her teeth, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">never had a vessel seemed to crawl so</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly over the face of the waters. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched as long as they could in patience</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the shore, and then, unable to bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strain inactive, launched the surf-boat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made sail on her and went scooting off on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long slant to windward to meet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">schooner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was late afternoon before they ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">alongside and made fast under the vessel's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lee. Sour old Captain Wiggins greeted Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">with more cordiality than he expected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm glad to see you, lad," said he, shak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hands. "We've been wondering all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voyage if we'd find you alive and kicking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shouldn't wonder if the men had a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">small bets on it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On me?" asked Tom in surprize. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wiggins chuckled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll find out soon enough, my lad.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where are the others?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Captain," said Tom gravely, "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorry to have to tell you that there are no</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. Joey and I are all that are left."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What!" cried Wiggins. "What do ye</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean, man? I left a dozen of ye.

Now he dallied with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, laughing at the quick response the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Euryalus made to his demands. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unquestionably like a living, sentient thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">this day--she pretended to be skittish, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slapped a little feather of sunkissed spray</seg><seg type="columnLine">over her rail; she broke away from the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">straining grip on the \vheel and fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the bits; then she sidled regretfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to her course, and clamored along with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out deviating a hair from the set course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Time after time old Meadows laughed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and with her; time after time he fondled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spokes. It was very good to have a ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">you could trust, and the old skipper re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">joiced in the fulness of his life. At nights</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was wont to pray that when the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">came he and his ship might go together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But Able Seaman Royaler had other</seg><seg type="columnLine">views on that subject.

His sole reason for</seg><seg type="columnLine">signing-on aboard the Euryalus had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">to avoid trouble with the Chilean police.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There had been knives drawn in a tavern</seg><seg type="columnLine">brawl, and a man had gone down, badly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabbed; therefore Able Seaman Royaler</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit out as quickly as he could, and reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">Antofagasta in the lumber-filled, seldom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">used boat of a "dago" coasting-schooner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Being compelled to stow away aboard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">"stinking dago" hurt his pride. He strongly</seg><seg type="columnLine">54</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">resented discipline, and was somewhat given</seg><seg type="columnLine">to whetting a long, ugly knife which he car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried at his hip in deep-sea fashion. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went aloft and performed the appointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">task he thought bitterly of the rasp in Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain Meadows' voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He'd better watch himself," he growled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the topsail clew. "I'm an ugly man to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get across with. He'll find that out if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tries his hard-case packet tricks on with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Serenely unconscious of the enmity he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had aroused, Meadows went below after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the helmsman returned.

Later he went to sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN the trouble came it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly, without warning. Roy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aler was at the bottom of it, as was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only natural. He was at the wheel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">making an indifferent job of it; the ship was</seg><seg type="columnLine">steering trickily as he had been informed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man he relieved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mate paused from his steady pacing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the weather poop to mention that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailed in various ships with various men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that he had never in all his born days</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen a ship so grossly mishandled. "Watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, you--you gardener!" he said, with ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jectives to correspond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You try your hand at her yourself,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarled Royaler with an evil snap of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. "Try her yourself, mister!

That word reached Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain Meadows' ears just as he hove himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">on deck through the companionway. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">a curious, tremulous anger possessed him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had newly awakened from a sleep in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he dreamed the ship had suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed an actual soul.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stumped aft, but the mate was there</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him. Mr. Bunting towered over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">recalcitrant steersman, and his face went</seg><seg type="columnLine">brick red.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You give me any of your slack jaw, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, and I'll rough-house you till you</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know your wisdom teeth from break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast-time," said Bunting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A fat lot of rougli-housing you'll do,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Royaler coughed, and his teeth showed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an evil snarl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All his days he had resented discipline,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when angry there was a curious black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish-red cloud which settled on his brain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinded his thinking powers. It had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened similarly that day in the Chilean</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink-shop; it was happening now. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">boasted in the forecastle that no adjectived</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer was ever going to "haze" him and go</seg><seg type="columnLine">on feeling happy. He had a position to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep up, because one of his messmates was</seg><seg type="columnLine">working in the mizzen rigging and overlook-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing all that was going on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mate caught him by the neck and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged him away from the wheel as Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain Meadows arrived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Steady, steady!" chirped the old man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his white beard flying in the breeze.

But by this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time the two men were wrestling together;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Royaler threw out a leg and tripped Bunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; the pair crashed to the deck. Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meadows had never lacked pluck. He bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">and caught the seaman under the armpits</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lugged him upright. Royaler antici-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pated a joint attack and much punishment;</seg><seg type="columnLine">his free hand went to his hip. The long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-sharpened blade slid in and was with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn--smoking lightly, with a thin red</seg><seg type="columnLine">film on its brightness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You hound!" said Meadows, and placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand on his breast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He moved quietly away and looked at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers; they were red and wet. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly sat down on the planking, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">groped at the deck-seams with fingers that</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked convulsively. He coughed thick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, and looked wonderingly at Royaler, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was crouching behind the wheel with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">still reeking knife advanced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You try it--that's all," said the seaman</seg><seg type="columnLine">uglily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was all he said at the moment, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause Mr. Bunting whipped a belaying-pin</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the rail and threw it with some small</seg><seg type="columnLine">skill. It took the murderer full in the fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, and he collapsed as a pricked balloon</seg><seg type="columnLine">might. But it was too late to help Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meadows, who without unseemly fuss rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over on planking that was becoming sul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lied, and quietly died, stabbed clean through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heart by a man who knew his job.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Bunting rose to the emergency with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a single thought of the advantage that</seg><seg type="columnLine">accrued to himself through his senior's</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. He shouted, and the watch came</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Ship Remembers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">55</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> running; the man who h°.d been working</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> aioft slid down a backstay and ran to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> joggling wheel.

It only meant killing a warder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scaling a wall or two, and hiding up in un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspected holes and watercourses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anyway he was free now, and he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take extremely good care that he wasn't re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">captured.

A refreshment-basket</seg><seg type="columnLine">was forthcoming from the car; but a sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den dull thud that might have been a shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">compelled the murderer to take more heed</seg><seg type="columnLine">56</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to his life than to his appetite. What he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had already tasted of freedom was savory</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the palate; he cursed blackly as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of the dreary mbnotony of personal</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His principal emotion as he set off away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the highroad with half a fowl in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and a wedge of brown bread in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, was U feeling of resentment against</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Meadows, who had caused him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to commit a murder that was really</seg><seg type="columnLine">unnecessary--and in circumstances that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rendered capture a certainty. Royaler was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not opposed to murder as murder, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he preferred to do it under favorable</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But in the mean time he was free--as</seg><seg type="columnLine">free as the fog that swirled and eddied</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him. And during the long, black</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours in his cell, as during the long, terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours of his toiling, he had planned this</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape in every detail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dry land was no friend to a man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood on his hands and his soul; but the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">was different. Once let him get afloat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would snap his fingers at all possibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">of recapture. He remembered reading once</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a time the story of a man who had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only made his escape by hiding in a ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but who had also destroyed the entire ship's</seg><seg type="columnLine">company when they discovered the mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derer's identity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's me for the sea--as quick as smoke,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said with his mouth full of unaccustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicacies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was the idea; either to stow away</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some vessel's hold or else to sign on legi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">timately on an outward-bounder. It could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be done if a man knew as much about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">undercurrents of sea-life as Royaler did.</seg><seg type="columnLine">True, discharges were necessary as a proof</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a man's good faith; but--wasn't it possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble either to drug or actually knock out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">genuine sailorman, who was the simplest</seg><seg type="columnLine">person in existence, and acquire all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers and his identity?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oh, no; Royaler had no fears on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">score, now that he was free. The land was</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of warnings and terrors; the soughing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a tree's branches in the light wind re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded him of the rustling of wind in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship's sails; just as the Euryplus' sails had</seg><seg type="columnLine">rustled on that day when-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He forced himself to set that memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside because it created visions of old Mead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ows' blank stare as he clawed at the deck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seams, and bred up a sensation as if his dia-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">phragm had turned to water within him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was not at all sorry that he had com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted the crime--he was acting in self-de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fense--and he spewed out black and bitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">curses on his victim's soul; but it was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well to try to forget the incident. Any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way he had quite enough to think about</seg><seg type="columnLine">without that, considering the whole coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tryside would be up and about in search of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him. -the land, anyhow! Let him get</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">afloat and he'd snap his fingers at all chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of recapture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not goin' back to that perishin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">-he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was money in the clothing he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquired--a good sum of money.

Better to wash</seg><seg type="columnLine">out that idea of snaffling another man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers, though--no need to run too many</seg><seg type="columnLine">risks. He wasn't the man to spoil the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a ha'p'orth of tar, not he!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Avoiding roads and houses as if they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">plague-infected, he succeeded in reaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">his destination without arousing suspicion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a desperately low beer palace not far</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed from the waterside he secured a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough-and-ready meal and sufficient rum to</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm up that chilled portion of his frame</seg><seg type="columnLine">which lay beneath his belt. He also treated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other occupant of the bar to copious</seg><seg type="columnLine">libations; and on leaving borrowed his un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known friend's greatcoat and cap; both of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pronouncedly nautical cut. As he left a</seg><seg type="columnLine">substantial tweed ulster and cap behind, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered he was treating the snoring shell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">back with the utmost decency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Snugly attired, exaggerating, the roll of</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Ship Remembers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">57</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his gait, with the peaked cap pulled well</seg><seg type="columnLine">down over his eyes, he betook himself to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waterside. It was growing late, but in cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain quarters of the docks there was still a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good deal of activity; men moved to and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fro. The fog was thinning, though fog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">horns blew weirdly from outside the port;</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the nearer harbor bells clanged--much as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prison bells had clanged across the bleak</seg><seg type="columnLine">moor after the warning gun had been fired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Royaler cursed the prison fluently as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged his coat collar up about his ears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gave a husky good-night to theconstable</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the dock-gate. He breathed with greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">freedom as the officer answered his remarks</seg><seg type="columnLine">without any suggestion of suspicion. Ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently the alarm had not yet reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">this port.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The keen scent of tide-water was good</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his nostrils as he threaded his way in</seg><seg type="columnLine">amongst the long lines of trucks that clut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered the many rails. The electric arc</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights were blurred by the remnants of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">log, and a slashing rain was commencing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall; but such discomfort was a trifle when</seg><seg type="columnLine">compared with the other discomforts of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">years past. Here and there steam-winches</seg><seg type="columnLine">clattered and hissed; a big steamer blew</seg><seg type="columnLine">down her boilers with a deafening clamor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But too many people were working about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lighted steamers--far too many. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be officers about, too--and on prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciple Royaler detested officers. Still, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stationary trucks afforded sufficient cover;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and. lurking behind and amongst them, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a careful scrutiny to the possibilities</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the situation. It must be remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the man was a sailor, and familiar with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fashions of ports. He moved after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while to the string-piece of a quay, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked down at the sullen black water. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tide was making, and he estimated that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be high water before dawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That's a bit of all right," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked up at the nearest steamer, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her bluff, purposeful bow, at her skimpy</seg><seg type="columnLine">masts that towered away into yellowish un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainty, and saw light glint on thin wires.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Curse their blarsted wireless!"he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was a matter to be taken into con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sideration though--a ship that was equipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with wireless was a danger in itself. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more than possible, quite probable in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed, that a general wireless alarm would</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie sent out to all ships at sea, instructing</seg><seg type="columnLine">those responsible for their welfare to main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain a vigilant lookout for an escaping crim- '</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">inal whose natural trade was the sea, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">who might conceivably be expected to hive</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to his customary environment. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">the common-sense thing to do was to avoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wireless-fitted ship. - Only, the worst of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that practically every steamer was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipped in these go-ahead, utilitarian days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A wind-jammer--that's my mark," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Royaler. "Windjammers don't carry wire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less; not much, they don't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He skulked back behind the trucks as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard footsteps advancing, and from this</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover he searched the skyline. His heart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a leap of relief as he made out, black</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the gloom, the stately sparring of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailing-ship. Treading delicately and avoid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the larger water-pools, he made his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward that pleasurable sight. This part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dockland was quieter than the rest--no</seg><seg type="columnLine">night work was going on. It was a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly easy matter to slink toward the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionless sailing-craft. A single well-smoked</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamp burned at her gangway; there was also</seg><seg type="columnLine">a glimmer of light in the forecastle scuttles;</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that forecastle came a sound of maud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin singing, and one harsh voice threatening</seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction to any who interfered with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">owner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Spite of the chill that beset him and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spatter of driven rain, Royaler chuckled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There are certain sounds that can not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistaken by any one conversant with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning. This drowsing ship was due to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sail almost at once--probably with the flood</seg><seg type="columnLine">that morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They've oiled themselves up pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">well," said Royaler, referring to the deni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zens of the forecastle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  To his certain belief the ship had signed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her outward-bound crew that day; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew, as was customary, were instructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be aboard by midnight--that certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant an early departure. Now no self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">respecting crew ever stayed overnight</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard a windjammer in a home port if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could avoid it; on the night of arrival they</seg><seg type="columnLine">promptly got money--either from the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain or from the tailors' runners, who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">only too willing to advance it, scenting</seg><seg type="columnLine">much ultimate gain. The day after arrival</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were all paid off, as owners did not be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve in employing men a minute longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">than they could help. Therefore the argu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment was self-evident--the ship was due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sail, and she was a windjammer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A blarsted miracle, that's what I calls</seg><seg type="columnLine">it," Royaler informed himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">58</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a clear line of retreat ready to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">utilized he lost something of his earlier</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathless panic and took thought to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future. It was necessary to go to sea pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared for a spell of hiding. Sailing-ships,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whilst offering many advantages also pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessed disadvantages. They sometimes, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">instance, kept their pilots aboard for days</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they met with a foul wind, say. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">stowaways, unwanted, were always sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">back ashore if discovered before the pilot</seg><seg type="columnLine">left. Consequently a man must supply him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self with a sufficiency of food; and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Royaler proceeded to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He left the docks by another gate than</seg><seg type="columnLine">that by which he had entered. He affected</seg><seg type="columnLine">semi-intoxication, and jocularly invited the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarding constable, who was sheltering in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cubby-hole out of the slash of the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creasing rain, to accompany him for a fare-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well drink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'd best get aboard, my son," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the policeman after the most cursory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">glances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A' right, ole son--just goin' get little</seg><seg type="columnLine">soap an' matches," Royaler said, and stum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A belated eating-house threw unreal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghostly lights across the wet pavement; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered and purchased lavishly, still affect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing intoxication.

This would be the mate, of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">course--he sounded genially disposed. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship was definitely outward bound--</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly for a three-months' passage. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">if only the watchman would cuddle down</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his customary snooze in the galley-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The watchman stumped up and down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck a time or two, until the light in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate's cabin went out; then he slipped into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea-kitchen, hooked the door and stirred</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire. Royaler waited a little longer be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore slipping inconspicuously aboard. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not use the gangway--it was not really</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary, because the deep-laden ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">floated low in the water, and her rail was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just about level with the string-piece. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">availed himself of the braces and bumpkins,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and landed on the deck without a sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was very dark, very, very dark; but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sailor enough to be able to find his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. He got away from the shoreward</seg><seg type="columnLine">side as a first precaution, and then groped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way along the after-hatch. That was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">securely battened down, as was only to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected. He tried the main-hatch; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">also was secure. But no ship, least of all a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailing-ship, ever left port with all her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatches fastened--there were spare ropes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other gear to be stowed away at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last minute--so the fore-hatch supplied his</seg><seg type="columnLine">needs. One corner of the covering tarpau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lins was loosely drawn over the hatch-cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers; and it required only a little exertion on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his part to lift the wooden plank beneath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He slipped below, and breathed deeply</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a man emerging from a dive might do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So far all was well; but his concealment was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as yet far from complete. Also he made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery that he was tired; he yawned</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily as he felt about the cargo, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">only partially filled the 'tween-decks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gen'ral cargo," he said, touching bales</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cases and casks. "Oughtn't to starve</seg><seg type="columnLine">here-aboard. Down the pump-wells, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">--that's the spot."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had himself in a previous life taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">part in the customary systematic search for</seg><seg type="columnLine">stowaways; and the deeper down he got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">better. He therefore wormed his way in</seg><seg type="columnLine">amongst the stacked cases and bales, past</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foremast, well aft, until he encountered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stout timber casing of the pump-wells.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was certain to be a loose plank--as</seg><seg type="columnLine">always--and he found it. Once inside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stout box--it was nothing but a box--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled about until he discovered the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">significant hatch that led deeper, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not consider his work well done until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Ship Remembers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">59</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stood on the actual flooring of the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold. Down here it was stuffy; the smell</seg><seg type="columnLine">was far from pleasant; but it was freedom</seg><seg type="columnLine">and security.

Once we get out into open water and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weather takes off, we'll alter her trim a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no question about it; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Euryalus was behaving badly. The wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">was blowing from almost dead ahead, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the narrow waters it was necessary to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack very frequently; each time she went</seg><seg type="columnLine">about she shook herself, she was lazy, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung in irons and did everything that a ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">should not do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The newly joined crew called her by op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">probrious names because of the extra work</seg><seg type="columnLine">required in her handling; and they hinted</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkly that Russian Finns were amongst</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crew, or else some man had failed to pay</seg><seg type="columnLine">his washerwoman. That, too, would ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">count for the bad weather--heavyr rains</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a baffling fog, together with sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">unholy wind-squalls. They growled out</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayers for a fair wind in order that, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were away from the joys of port, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">might get clear into open water, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant easier times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And whilst they growled and cursed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayed the Euryalus slugged to northward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to southward sheepishly. She soured</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tempers of all aboard her, and when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">full weight of the gale came away in a bois-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terous^squall that split the fore-topsail from</seg><seg type="columnLine">head-rope to foot her people were thor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oughly wearied out. So wearied, indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the captain coiled himself down on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chart-room settee for a snooze, and prompt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly sank into a slumber that might have been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">death's twin. So weary that the forecastle</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookout, folding his arms as he stood in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fork of the forestay, closed his eyes--"just</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rest his eyelids a bit," as he explained to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself--and lost consciousness of his sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roundings and his responsibilities. He, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">common with his shipmates, had lost many</seg><seg type="columnLine">valuable watches below, and during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hectic days ashore he had failed to coil away</seg><seg type="columnLine">a reserve of sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second mate, who had the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch, folded his arms on that teakwood</seg><seg type="columnLine">rail which Captain Meadows, deceased, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">often caressed, and began to think about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl at home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Euryalus, as if repenting of her pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vious fretfulness, was now ramping along</seg><seg type="columnLine">in handsome style, with a heartening rum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble of wind in her swollen canvas, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vigorous flapping of cordage and the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vigorating roar of parted and broken water</seg><seg type="columnLine">all around and about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's bucking up," thought the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate, and yawned widely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He determined to go and look at the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass very soon; but there was time enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet.

It must, Mr. Lorri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer decided, be getting on toward that hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">now.

Perhaps it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that he suspected that John was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid of him, because as he stood there</seg><seg type="columnLine">hating his assistant's long, serious face more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ever, knowing that he could beat it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pulp without a great deal of trouble and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would enjoy doing it, he saw no trace</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fear in it--not even a sign that John</seg><seg type="columnLine">cared whether he struck or not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a throaty exclamation of disgust</seg><seg type="columnLine">and impatience that was intended to dismiss</seg><seg type="columnLine">John as being unworthy of any further con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sideration, he turned toward the pile of</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakwater sticks, ostensibly to examine</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, but actually to take out some measure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his bottled-up wrath on the Kroo-boys.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here, you! Headman! Let me have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a look at those sticks! Edge!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The toe of his boot emphasized the order</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, principally with boot and fist, he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">an expert inspection of the whole pile, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">demning about a dozen to save his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Too short!

John</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked off the wharf then and went down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kernel store. He had seen Brock do th- .</seg><seg type="columnLine">same thing to Ganson once, and he some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times vaguely pictured himself in a !:'re</seg><seg type="columnLine">position, but he had never taken the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tingency seriously enough to decide what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would do if it happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ganson had done nothing; snivelled a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">and limped into the privacy of his own room</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he could become as vilely profane as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he cared to at Brock's expense; then went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into the shop next morning and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shop-boys and their customers acquaint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed with a few more jabs that had even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">snap in them than usual. He continued to</seg><seg type="columnLine">call Brock cap'n and listened, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent spoke, as if he were a god. Complete-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly cowed by Brock's massive cruelties, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too much of a brute in miniature him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self ever to have gumption enough to throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the yoke. To John, the little Cockney</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just an unpleasant voice and few</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped aitches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the kernel store where kernel-brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">lizards with red heads kept the place par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tially free of flies, John tried to forget both</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them. It was shady and almost cool in</seg><seg type="columnLine">there and though the aroma of sweating</seg><seg type="columnLine">kernels was not the pleasantest in the world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had the virtue of keeping Brock out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four large, round, twenty-eight bushel</seg><seg type="columnLine">measures--somewhat oddly called coolers--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that swung upon a frame, formed a dividing</seg><seg type="columnLine">line between the stock of kernels on hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the receiving end of the store where</seg><seg type="columnLine">John sat upon a high stool before a higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk and tried to make sure that he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he paid for. Most of the time he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">because John was a canny man who was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">given to careless ways of doing business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was punctiliously careful, for instance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the percentage of shell adhering to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kernels he bought did not exceed two and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one-half per cent. The limit was five, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">John thought half of that was better and</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured of a safe margin in that direction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his principal anxiety thereafter was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that the native trader, with or without</seg><seg type="columnLine">the assistance of John's own kernel-boys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not cheat him in the matter of the quan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tity delivered.

John's</seg><seg type="columnLine">four cooler measures were filled, tipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and emptied into stock several times</seg><seg type="columnLine">that morning) because Dawanna's business</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought smaller trade in its train, and John</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept a careful tally of the number of coolers</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed in by the Sobo on a pad that lay on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his desk. His total when it was all over was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nineteen coolers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dawanna's figures, however, did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">agree with John's. The Sobo trader claimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had delivered twenty coolers, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when John refused to believe him and fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther refused to give him a "book" or check</seg><seg type="columnLine">for more than nineteen coolers Dawanna</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed John's house in jaw-destroying Sobo</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went up to see Brock about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the trouble here!" Brock growled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in John's ear about half a minute later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Dawanna and his boys and some</seg><seg type="columnLine">small-fry bushel-traders who knew exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the trouble was, looked on.

But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows the difference between the amount of</seg><seg type="columnLine">"pay" he receives for one cooler of kernels</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that which he gets for two. Which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">ample knowledge for his purposes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> John wrote Dawanna's book very care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully and presently handed it to Brock who</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Jock Todd</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">67</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had intended to glance at it perfunctorily</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turn it over to Dawanna with a flourish.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brock, however, did neither of these things.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked twice at that kernel check and</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not hand it to Dawanna at all.

"If ye want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give him a book for another cooler on</seg><seg type="columnLine">your own responsibility, that's another mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter.

With a stub in the kernel check</seg><seg type="columnLine">book showing the receipt of nineteen coolers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was going to be very difficult to compel</seg><seg type="columnLine">John to alter that record without giving him</seg><seg type="columnLine">an enviable opportunity to involve the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Liverpool office in the rumpus--a rumpus in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Brock would be on the wrong side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fence because he was juggling with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">firm's money while John was trying to pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tect its interests against the most brazen</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of theft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were many things which Brock did</seg><seg type="columnLine">which did not interest the Liverpool office</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the least.

Not that</seg><seg type="columnLine">J ohn made any sort of antagonistic demon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stration with the shovel, because nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was farther from his mind. He simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned upon it and, from an unbiased point</seg><seg type="columnLine">of view, left the question of the disputed</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooler entirely to Brock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The agent looked at the crumpled kernel</seg><seg type="columnLine">check again; then, in mongrel Sobo and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jakri, which John did not understand, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said deprecatingly to Dawanna and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored audience generally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Long Face is empty in his head and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">book hand writes like a catfish!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tore the check into small fragments</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and threw them with a large gesture at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woolly heads about him.

When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he handed the new check to Dawanna he</seg><seg type="columnLine">invited him with flattering generosity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have another drink and left the store with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out so much as a glance at John who still</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood leaning on the kernel shovel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently John investigated what Brock</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done, and found that the stub of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">check calling for nineteen coolers had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">canceled. Beneath it was another stub for</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty coolers, initialed by Brock. John</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrugged his shoulders, closed the book and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said and thought no more about it.

He had to. If the watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy got into trouble it would be his respon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibility. John was afraid it was going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a serious business, too, because there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt in his mind about the action he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to take if Brock persisted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">being unpleasant. He eyed the agent up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and down in a speculative way and, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gig-wharf being of no great size, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than six feet of space between them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Be it remembered that John was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fighter. If a situation were too big for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him he left it alone or sought some means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">going around it. Yet, thousands of miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">from anything but a trace of civilization and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Paller beach, of all places, where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quite alone, he became convinced that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only thing to do under the circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances was to turn Brock's rage against</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself; to exasperate him so that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">give him, John, a sufficient reason for hitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">him back. The mangrove swamps of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Niger Delta do queer things to the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlikely of men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm chargin' the hire o' the canoe to gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral expense," he said by way of a beginning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his accent was more pronounced even</seg><seg type="columnLine">than usual. "I'll give ye the chit to O. K.</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Monday."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brock turned his head slowly. His face</seg><seg type="columnLine">twitched as it might have done had a mos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quito bitten him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who gave you permission to leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach?" he asked tonelessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You didn't, if that's what ye're in doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">about.

Brock's eyes became flat, colorless, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heavy right hand drove for John's head</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all the precision and force of a piston</seg><seg type="columnLine">rod. And John dropped as men usually did</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Brock hit them and hit them right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But that was a long way from the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. It was only the beginning. John was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazed and dizzy and not a little sick. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">head hung over the wharf's edge and he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lights on the cargo boat that lay oppo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">site Marsden &amp; Co.'s beach go around in</seg><seg type="columnLine">circles, then pop up and down. Then some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one was kicking him and some one else</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with a Cockney accent was saying "-!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Oh, my-1" quite often. The kicks hurt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as Brock intended that they should and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them did its best to stave in a rib.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So John slid from the wharf into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, which was slimy and unpleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut also wet and served to wake him up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not climb on to the wharf again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though he heard Ganson nervously inquir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing whether he could swim, he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop to alleviate the sycophantic Cockney's</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under cover of the darkness he swam</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly around to the oil wharf, clambered</seg><seg type="columnLine">on to it and headed stealthily, by way of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">galley stairs, for "home." The blinking,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">uncertain lights of the up-river factories</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a long way off; too long to be of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">use to him or the watch-boy then. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a pitiless intensity of purpose in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every water-soaked step he took. The little</seg><seg type="columnLine">black house-boys--or stewards--preparing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to serve dinner, were busy in the saloon, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heeded their amazed stares not at all as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he passed through it on his way to his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few minutes, surprizingly few for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he was dry and clothed again and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way down to the beach, where, around</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the substantial posts that supported</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kernel store awning, Brock and Ganson</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the headman formed a vague cluster</seg><seg type="columnLine">illuminated only by an inevitable hurricane</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamp. The watch-boy was of the group, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet not of it. He was tied to the post.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> John was dressed in his working-clothes;</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray flannel trousers, somewhat oil-smeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">and streaked with kernel dust, heavy soled</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes and the plainest kind of shirt. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaw ached sullenly as a result of Brock's</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack, but the swim he had indulged in had</seg><seg type="columnLine">revived him completely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was not angry. Brock had struck him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kicked him when he was down. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, if he could, going to strike Brock</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather harder than he had been struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, from his point of view, was simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">justice and common sense combined. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no plan of battle. Ih fact the word</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle did not occur to him at all. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a fighting man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also, in championing the watch-boy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause he was not thinking of Wilberforce or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uncle Tom or of any one or anything like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. Had the watch-boy deserved a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrashing, as thieving, careless watch-boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes do, he might not have witnessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spectacle, because he did not approve</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it, but interference with the course of</seg><seg type="columnLine">justice, however crude and brutalizing it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be, would never have occurred to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. In this case, however ....</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Evidently Brock and Ganson had no anx-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iety about him having been drowned. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">headman had seen- him slipping into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">galley and had so informed Brock, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">evinced no interest in the matter. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he heard John's heavy step on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravel path leading from the house to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kernel store, he turned about and viewed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">approach with lowering brows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just in time, Mr. Todd," he said in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponderous effort to be facetious, knowing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">70</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time that he would have to knock</seg><seg type="columnLine">John down again. "We are just about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So we are," John observed dryly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KgS BUT he did not strike Brock as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brock had struck him. With the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat of one great hand, before Brock</seg><seg type="columnLine">had any kind of a chance to avoid it, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuffed the agent with all his might on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left side of the head, and while Brock's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head rocked as if he had been hit with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a paddle-blade John cuffed him on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right side of the head to preserve the bal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance. Then Brock's natural instincts as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fighter overcame his surprize and, partly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to avoid more punishment, but greatly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">to put an end to such tomfoolery and take</seg><seg type="columnLine">matters properly into his own hands, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was Brock's mistake. He should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have backed away. But he was the bull</seg><seg type="columnLine">type of fighter and liked to move forward at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all times, crushing the other man, as a rule,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the pitiless ferocity of his attack; and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this case, when he needed a few seconds to</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear his buzzing head, he did what ring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighters only too frequently do. He clinched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was then that Ganson gasped aloud and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the headman jabbered something like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ritual in Kroo, while the watch-boy, tied to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the post, did not know whether to be glad or</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorry. Dim shapes of canoes passing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their way up-river seemed to hesitate to</seg><seg type="columnLine">witness the result of that conflict, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat bashful moon came out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind a screen of lazily moving clouds and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">throwing the encircling black wall of man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">groves into high relief, shed more light upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the battle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Brock'floundered in to wind his arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">about John and rest a little while, John,</seg><seg type="columnLine">very naturally, tried to push him away, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brock had a momentary impression of col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liding with the buffer of an engine. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge hand--John's right--flat against his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest; that was all that happened, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">John's raw-boned body standing on sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantial and solidly planted feet was behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and a second later, the hand slipped up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little bit and long, hard, bony fingers fast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened themselves about Brock's bull-throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brock gurgled and tried at once to tear</seg><seg type="columnLine">John's hand away, but John held on, slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeezing the breath of life out of the agent's</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge body. He was not doing it angrily</seg><seg type="columnLine">either; just methodically. Brock, then,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to punch John away from him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">John retaliated instantly by rattling Brock's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head with a resounding cuff that made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise like a pistol-shot. That was John's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistake. He should have been content to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gone on choking Brock, because the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slap not only helped to loosen his grip on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brock's throat, but also made the agent go</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite mad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That he was mad]with fear made no dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference. Fear is often responsible for exhi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitions of superhuman strength and cour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age, and when Brock literally tore his throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of John's grip and leaped upon him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat him savagely to earth with several</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildly ferocious blows about the head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, he was spending more strength than he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could afford on a night like that, and was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">using his head at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, John was not a pugilist; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew nothing about pugilism and could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">take advantage of Brock's wildness. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried simply to get his head clear and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth empty of blood before he got up</seg><seg type="columnLine">again to stop Brock flogging that watch-boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ganson did not help him any. No one did</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he did not expect them to. The head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man and the watch-boy were muttering to</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves and each other in Kroo and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood aghast at the spectacle of a "small-boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man" daring to fight the cap'n.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The veranda of the house was lined with</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally amazed house-boys called to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene by Brock's quite audible shouts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain and anger, and shuffling, naked feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming from the direction of the Kroo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house indicated the presence of other</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectators peering surreptitiously around</seg><seg type="columnLine">corners, the whites of their eyes flickering</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a background of black in a fair imitation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the firefly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Brock was kicking John again, tell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him with hoarsely profane insistence to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get up, and the invitation concluding with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">name John did not like, he did get up only to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be almost immediately knocked down again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And again Brock kicked him, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch-boy whined and Ganson excitedly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">began to talk to -. John spat blood,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled away from Brock's cruel feet, wiped</seg><seg type="columnLine">one good eye free of sweat and tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">scramble up once more to prevent Brock</seg><seg type="columnLine">flogging the watch-boy. He was not con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious of any great pain; just a sickness in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pit of his stomach and a dizzy uncer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainty as to the exact location of Brock's</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet and fists.</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Jock Todd</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">71</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half-way up again, he found one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent's impassioned feet in his ribs. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he had barely realized the force of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that kick before Brock kicked him again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">John thereupon did another very natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. He flung himself bodily at Brock's</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs. The agent was quick, but he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick enough. John managed to get a grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Brock's right ankle with one hand and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other hand coming instinctively to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate's assistance, John hung on. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad he had on his working clothes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything that happened then happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a very few seconds. Brock tried to kick</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and stamp upon him with his free foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">but John, gripping the imprisoned ankle as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if his life depended upon it--which it prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably did--scurried on his stomach out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach and made the agent squeal as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers bit twistingly into his flesh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Brock tried to drag himself free but</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that he had to drag John with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had no strength left for anything as</seg><seg type="columnLine">strenuous as that, so he tried to stand as</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmly as possible and tug the ankle out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">John's huge-handed grip and, of course, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lift the foot off the ground to do it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  John let him lift it and slid a little nearer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he did not let Brock put the foot down</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. In fact he helped Brock lift it farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">than he intended and slid still nearer, pull-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the leg up and out, compelling Brock to</seg><seg type="columnLine">balance himself as best he could on one leg.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A fifth of a second later Brock shrieked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">very palpable agony and called upon Gan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son and the headman for help. But they</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not stir; at least the headman did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ganson, not at all certain about what to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do, was much too slow in acting to be of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">use to Brock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having quickly shifted his grip--one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand at a time--from Brock's ankle to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">toe and the back of his heel, John had</seg><seg type="columnLine">' twisted the agent's leg much as a washer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman wrings out a wet sheet and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a final very determined twist and heave had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled Brock's unbalanced hulk headlong</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from him--not unlike the manner in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which his father, Jock Todd of Abergowrie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed the caber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     BROCK came to a halt upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ifWB face several yards away and John,</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly getting on his feet, rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to him so as to get a really good grip on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brute-man's throat. One of John's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes was completely closed, his face was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">streaked with dirt and sweat and blood, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a whispering awe was all about him and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased when Brock did not stir; at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">not with any show of fight in his move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments. The agent groaned, rolled pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully over on his back, tried to rise, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">subsided again, the main difficulty being</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently in the right leg which John had</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted so assiduously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Ere! Chuck it!" Ganson remonstrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">with John, who was doing no more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">look at Brock just then. "You'll go to jug</seg><seg type="columnLine">for this!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He kicked me when I was down," John</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked, breathing with some difficulty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but I'm hopin' I'm not his kind." Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly to the prostrate agent, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">swearing brutally through his clenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth: "What's the matter wi' ye? Are</seg><seg type="columnLine">ye finished or are ye just shammin'? I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort o' notion ye'll take a lot o' watchin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet, because ye're a dog, Brock, and it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">just common justice that ye should be made</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come to heel.

Why don't ye</seg><seg type="columnLine">get up?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brock made no answer and did not move.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew that his right knee was dislocated</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that John Todd was responsible for it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but no thought.of*the district commissioner</seg><seg type="columnLine">had occurred to him.

He marked the presence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadowy spectators and made a careful</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental note of the fact that the headman</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ganson had not come to his assistance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would attend to them later, too, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had finished with John Todd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Better chuck it, Todd, I'm tellin' yer,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ganson advised again nervously. "This</seg><seg type="columnLine">'ere ain't no joke."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No, ye're right there, little man; it's far</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a joke, and instead o' swearin' the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's doin' he'd better, if he hasn't forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">how, be prayin' to the Lord to forgive him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for kickin' me when I was down, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">it'll not do him a bit o' good to ask me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Are ye goin' to get up, Brock, or are ye</seg><seg type="columnLine">done?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since Brock merely groaned and swore</seg><seg type="columnLine">still more violently, John stepped away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him and, ordering the headman to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have some of his boys carry the agent up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs---if he needed carrying--he released</seg><seg type="columnLine">the watch-boy who was tied to the post,</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him to go about his business as usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then walked off, betraying a slight limp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">72</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one interfered. The headman, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause John was white, dared not, and Gan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son was utterly incapable of coping with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation. In another few minutes the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach was almost quiet again and John was</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscientiously washing the blood and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat of wrath from his body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BROCK did not have to be carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his rooms. Painfully and slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, resenting the fact that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to lean upon two of the most stalwart</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his Kroo-boys, he made his way "on top,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking neither to right nor left. When Gan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, following upon the heels of his master</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an obedient puppy, offered to help him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gave no heed, but when the little Cockney</seg><seg type="columnLine">timidly suggested sending for the district</seg><seg type="columnLine">commissioner, Brock paused half-way up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stairs and looked back and down at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">senior assistant who was a step or two in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When I want the district commissioner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Ganson, I'll send for him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And with just enough strength left to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, he leaned all of his weight upon the sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porting Kroo-boys, swung his left leg stiff</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the hip and kicked Ganson quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">neatly off the stairs. Then he went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ganson did not get up for quite a while in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of the efforts of the Kroo-boy who ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his assistance. At first he thought his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast-bone had caved in because Brock's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy foot had kicked him there, knocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scanty breath out of his trifling body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But presently, when the Kroo-boy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped him to a seat on the stairs, he sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">there for some time trying to realize that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still alive and slowly nursed a waspish</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire for revenge into a healthy state of</seg><seg type="columnLine">animation that had to have an outlet some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps the spirit of John Todd entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Ganson; or it may have been only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passion that rode the humid night, or just</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that one of Brock's legs was ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viously not itself. In any case, Ganson did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not decide the matter hurriedly, nor did</seg><seg type="columnLine">he enter Brock's room in a rampaging anger</seg><seg type="columnLine">and proceed to mop the floor with what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">left of the agent. He called upon the cap'n</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he might have been expected to, quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and servilely, and inquired again if there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was anything he could do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brock was in his bedroom stretched out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a Madeira chair with the leg-rest in use.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a pint glass of brandy in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass-holder at his elbow. His right knee</seg><seg type="columnLine">was badly swollen and was swathed in wet</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloths till the doctor came. At that par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticular moment he was just sitting and wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing till he would be able to stand again. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be a day or a week or a month, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">whenever it was he would then tie John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Todd to a post instead of the watch-boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and carve his name on John's white skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a hippo-hide. He could almost do it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. Nothing," he answered Ganson</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickly. "Get out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A house-boy--Brock's own--on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the bedroom door which Ganson had</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully closed, heard his master's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crept silently away again. He felt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">intrusion at a time like that, for any reason,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be wise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why the 'ard feelin's, cap'n?" Ganson</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleaded. "I couldn't 'elp yer, 'onest I</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't. 'E grabbed 'old of yer leg and</seg><seg type="columnLine">'ung onter it, and bli' me if 'e didn't make</seg><seg type="columnLine">yer 'op like you was standin' on 'ot bricks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then when yer 'owled for me to come and</seg><seg type="columnLine">'elp yer, 'e tossed yer on yer ruddy 'ead like</seg><seg type="columnLine">you was somethin' 'e didn't want. 'E ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">'uman, 'e ain't! But that ain't no reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">why we should 'ave a row. That didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">give you no cause for kickin' me down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruddy stairs!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brock tried to rise, but though he got his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left foot on the floor, his right leg refused to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow so useless an impulse; and when Gan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son was sure of that he went a little nearer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mean, pasty little face twisting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">twitching in suddenly revealed passion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've booted me and given me -</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for a year and a 'alf.

When I wanted ter</seg><seg type="columnLine">'elp yer comin 'up the stairs you booted me</seg><seg type="columnLine">down 'em like I 'ad no more rights around</seg><seg type="columnLine">'ere than a mongrel pup.

And I'm goin' ter</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark yer so's it'll show, you-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rest of what Ganson said is not im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant. Brock's expression was much</seg><seg type="columnLine">more interesting. It was not wrathful nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">defiant nor calm. It was afraid. P'or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time in his life, perhaps, he shrank from</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting the eye of a fellow man. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Jock Todd</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">73</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">better than Ganson how helpless he was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how almost impossible it was for him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand and how useless would be his defense,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting in a chair, against Ganson's speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knowledge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Ganson was still fast on his feet;</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning-fast with that terrible left jab of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his which Brock had feared when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen it operating upon others, and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">small and hard to hit at any time. Brock</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew all that; knew that the little man also</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew it and would not scruple to take every</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage of his opportunity; and his flesh</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled away from the kind of punishment</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ganson could inflict as it might have done</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the threat of a branding-iron. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other brute of his type, Brock was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a coward before the promise of a punch on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nose. Ganson hit him there many</seg><seg type="columnLine">times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get on yer feet, you blighter!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as he spoke Ganson darted in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck, and darted out again; and the snake-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like speed and suddenness of the blow was</seg><seg type="columnLine">more responsible for the whine that escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brock than the force of it. And when,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second later, with an effort born wholly of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear, he tried to struggle to his feet, Ganson</seg><seg type="columnLine">feinted and slipped in--and out again--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a red trickle drooled out of a corner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brock's mouth as he flopped whimperingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into his chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not a fight. Simply a new form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquisition; a deliberate, malicious torturing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Brock's huge pain-racked body by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only method Ganson knew anything about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He gave to the left jab of the squared circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new significance, placing it alongside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumb-screw and the boot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The world beyond Brock's bedroom door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and windows was ominously silent; dank</seg><seg type="columnLine">and heavy and unresponsive to Brock's</seg><seg type="columnLine">whining calls for help as the shifty little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cockney saw to it that the nasty work went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. Jab--a pause--jab--a pause--jab--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pause--jab--jab--jab--jab----</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brock's boy, in answer to his master's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cries, came as far as the bedroom door but</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not open it. He knew Ganson was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, and Ganson's hands were like a ju-ju.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They struck one on the nose and the eye and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the belly and the jaw all at once, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brock's boy had no desire to be hit in or on</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of those places either at once or separ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately. The chief steward, to whom he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">his troubles, felt the same way about it, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally and quite naturally they went to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">John Todd, who was eating his dinner in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own room and enjoying the change. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him that Ganson was killing the cap'n,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and John, who had heard Brock's yells but</seg><seg type="columnLine">had paid no attention to them because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not imagine that Brock could possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">be yelling for him, went to inquire into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By that time Brock's face--but John's</seg><seg type="columnLine">one good eye did not see it. Brock had</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried it in the pillow behind him and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shielding his head with his arms as best he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could, only an ear was left exposed. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ganson began to punch that too, Brock</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to cry. He was still crying and Gan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son was still punching when John went in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are ye doin' ye little rat? Here!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stop it! You'll knock that ear away from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his head if ye-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't let him hit me! Don't let him hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">me again!" came the mumbling wail from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pillow; and John knew then that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no fight left in Brock's body or his soul.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ganson stopped. He could not help him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. John's great right hand was about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin neck and, as if he were of no more con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequence than a dirty towel, John flung him</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the opposite wall with a force that</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked most of the venom out of his sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem. Ere he could recover from the shock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">John gripped him by the neck again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">compelling him to stand upright, shook him</seg><seg type="columnLine">till his teeth rattled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do ye mean by it? Hittin' a help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less man like that? Are ye daft?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't let him hit me!" Brock whimpered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">again into the pillow. "Don't let him-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, you hold your tongue, you big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blubberin' bairn!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brock obeyed instantly. Ganson's arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung limply at his sides. His legs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">weaving under him, his face was like chalk</seg><seg type="columnLine">and perspiration streamed from him like</seg><seg type="columnLine">rain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I marked 'im! I marked the blighter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">'E's a mess, that's what--just a ruddy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mess!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> John took Ganson's word for it. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightened his hold upon the little Cockney's</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck and said dryly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come wi' me, little man, and I'll put</seg><seg type="columnLine">ye to your bed. That'll be the safest place</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you. I'm thinkin', because I'm afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">ye've got a vicious disposeetion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, much as if he were trailing a sack</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him, he dragged Ganson from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">74</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JOHN went up-river again that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night,'this time in the gig, only to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find that the story of the manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which he had brought about Brock's</seg><seg type="columnLine">downfall had preceded him. Half-way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the district commissioner's, whither he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound, he was met by a gigful of traders'</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistants who were going down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paller beach to find out if there was any</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth in the later story that Ganson had</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed the agent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> John told them solemnly that there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not, and though they seemed disappointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it, they turned and went back with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to hear him tell Daniel Dane Parker,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the D. C., his version of the whole business.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Which he did and later proved every word</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it to the D. C.'s complete satisfaction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So that Brock was quietly but officially re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved from the country and John, for a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">time, ran the Paller factory alone until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Liverpool office sent him an assistant or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two. It was thought best to invalid</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ganson home because his heart was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the thing that sticks in John's crop</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the fact that when he had finished telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">his story to the D. C., a compatriot of his,</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting him on the way to the consulate</seg><seg type="columnLine">gig-wharf, greeted him most familiarly with:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hullo, Jock. What's this I've been</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearin' about ye?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Because, as John was careful to explain to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl in Abergowrie when, nearly two</seg><seg type="columnLine">years later, he asked her by word of mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">to let him take her photograph back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast with him:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That name may fit my faither, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't fit me. You know fine, Bella, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm not a fightin' man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE two men broke into a shambling</seg><seg type="columnLine">run. One of them unhooked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canteen from his belt and forged a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit ahead of the other. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brink of the small declivity he stopped; an</seg><seg type="columnLine">agonized cry came through his parched lips.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"O God!" he groaned. "Jim, it's dry!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim came up beside him. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at the waterless water-hole. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other man was exhibiting signs of panic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a sidelong glance at him, Jim re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kinda looks that way, don't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other hurled the now useless canteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground and began to curse the Deity</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had a moment before invoked. His</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">action suggested the blind frenzy of despair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim looked at his partner steadily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Save yer breath, Bob." He spoke in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, even tone that checked the other's mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">outburst. "Better drop yer gun too; extra</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He let his own cartridge belt and holster</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop by way of example, but Bob did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow suit. Instead, at the mention of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word "gun," a wild look crept into his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim saw and acted quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, you don't," he said, yanking Bob's</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon from its sheath and flinging it as far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he was able. "Bob, old man, ketch hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">on yerself. We're livin' yet, ain't we?

Then we gotta make Bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock. We c'n do it by goin' steady. C'mon;</seg><seg type="columnLine">git goin'; we wasted too much time now."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim started off in the direction of the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">town of Bedrock, their only hope. Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuffled after him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With hat brims pulled down to shade</seg><seg type="columnLine">their eyes and heads bent forward the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men walked in an inferno. Not a vestige</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shade anywhere; the trackless waste</seg><seg type="columnLine">afforded not an inch of shelter from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">merciless sun that beat down upon them</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a coppery sky; the heat devils danced</seg><seg type="columnLine">and whirled around them. Yet they went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, because one was fired by the desire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">live and possessed the strength of will to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was hell! Step, step, step, until walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing became automatic. A burning thirst</seg><seg type="columnLine">precluded other suffering, their parched</seg><seg type="columnLine">throats and caked lips cried insistently for</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. As if in punishment for Bob's</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasphemy the sun shone with a terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliance. And, by an irony of fate, Jim's</seg><seg type="columnLine">canteen hung, unnoticed, at his side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neither spoke; there was no need for con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation. When Bob faltered in his stride,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim grasped him by the arm and urged him</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. And still they went plodding on. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, Jim asked himself, would the fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">continue?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the rest of that day they fought their</seg><seg type="columnLine">way step by tortuous step across the blaz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sand. To Jim the struggle for life be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came an obsession; in his semi-delirium he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancied the sun a living enemy. He shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fist at it, tried to swear at it, and drag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ged Bob with him to defeat its efforts to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">iff® WITH evening came a slight mea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">g&amp;JjS sure of relief. They flung their</seg><seg type="columnLine">* " aching bodies to the cooling sand to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest. When they had lain there for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time Jim turned to rise. In the movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt the canteen at his side, snatched it</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly and shook it. The hope that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">started in his breast died when no gurgle</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to his ear; in his feverish state he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten that the thing had been emptied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He dropped it beside his partner who lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">outstretched with his eyes closed. Then,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the nucleus of a wild idea germinating in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brain, he snatched it up again and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned it to the hook on his belt. It took</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good deal of effort to kick Bob to his feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Jim succeeded after renewed attempts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and off they started again on their weary</seg><seg type="columnLine">march.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had any one ever accused Jim Coulter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">being a psychologist he would have an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered, "I don't sabe Greek. What's it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in ord'nary lingo?" Yet the crazy scheme</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned over in his mind would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">worthy of a scientist. No student of "mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">over matter" was Jim, however; so we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">say that Providence suggested the plan to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and let it go at that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the dawn of the next day Bob sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">down without a word and stubbornly</seg><seg type="columnLine">refused to move and Jim dropped to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand beside him to gather what little</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength he had in reserve. After a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he crawled to his feet and unhooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canteen from his belt. Then he bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the prostrate form of his partner and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook him. When Bob looked up at him he</seg><seg type="columnLine">held the canteen up to his lips and pretended</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drink from it. At this Bob's eyes grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He raised himself on one hand and held</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the other; his jaw dropped in amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment when Jim, forcing a grin through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alkali dust on his face, shook his head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned away. Bob tried to speak, but no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound issued from his throat. The word</seg><seg type="columnLine">"water" formed on his lips. Jim had water;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim had water; Jim had water!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thought burned into his brain with</seg><seg type="columnLine">insistence; he got drunkenly to his feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered after him.

A horrible scream</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced its rasping way up from Bob's</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat; he tried to run forward and fell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He got up again and lurched after Jim who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had water, water; Jim had water and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't give him any! Jim realized now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had created a raving Frankenstein</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster that threatened to destroy him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He hooked the canteen to his belt and did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not turn again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OVER the hill that hides the town</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Bedrock from the expanse of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great desert two grizzled old pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectors urged their flea-bitten burros.

Both</seg><seg type="columnLine">old men started down the other side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill at a dead run.

Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had regained control of his reasoning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob was not long in coming to the realiza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of what his partner had done for him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After their burros had strayed away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">them during the sand-storm that had buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">their water-bags, Jim's canteen had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">emptied first, and there remained only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">obvious conclusion that Jim had literally</seg><seg type="columnLine">taunted him into saving himself.

"Who is the youth who fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows the king?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Tis the Prince Baldwin," returned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old jongleur.

It settled into place with a flick of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust, and Kafur turned in his saddle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beckoned Matteo and Ali to follow him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As their horses' hoofs rang on the planks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Matteo craned his head upward, expecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to surprize some sly watcher at loophole or</seg><seg type="columnLine">machicoulation. But there was not a sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of human occupancy. The walls and towers</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched around the mountainside, white</seg><seg type="columnLine">and vacant beneath the lowering sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He peered forward under the shadows of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arch of the gateway. There, too, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">emptiness. No guards awaited them; no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentries appeared. Their horses' hoofs rum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled in the archway. Behind them there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a clang, and Matteo looked back hastily</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see the portcullis dropped in place. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw, itself, commenced to rise again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">noiselessly, without a hint of machinery or</seg><seg type="columnLine">human hands. He shuddered. A fear akin</seg><seg type="columnLine">to that which Ali had expressed stole over</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. This place was eery, uncanny. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced himself to address a remark to Kafur</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they emerged from the gateway arch into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stone-paved courtyard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your lord is not dowered with many</seg><seg type="columnLine">servants, it seems."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nay, his servants are many, but dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will they condescend to take our</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses?" inquired Matteo sarcastically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In time. We have yet some distance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They passed through a gateway in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite wall of the courtyard which stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, and found themselves upon a zigzag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging ramp of stone, barred at intervals by</seg><seg type="columnLine">gates and lined with loopholed walls, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed the mountainside toward the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanted pile of the castle proper. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">defenses they had so far seen were only</seg><seg type="columnLine">outworks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Up and up, they toiled, their horses plod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ding steadily on the cobbled way. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of voices, no clashing of weapons, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">smell of cooking, reached them. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been in the Land of the Dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all the visible evidence of life that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">afforded them. The clicking of hoofs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creaking of saddles echoed prodigiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the long white walls that lined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ramp. Occasionally they came to a window</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the walls through which they might view</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wild tangle of mountains they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed, no less desolate than this Castle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emptiness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet Matteo fancied that unseen eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">io6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were watching him. He had a sensation as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if all about him sentient life was teeming,</seg><seg type="columnLine">held in check by some master will. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though any moment a thousand voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">might shriek a savage war-cry, and he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if they did his straining nerves must</seg><seg type="columnLine">break.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But nothing happened. Instead, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came into a second courtyard immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">below the wide-ranging cluster of towers</seg><seg type="columnLine">which capped the peak. From doorways</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its walls stepped immense negro slaves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad in spotless white waist-cloths, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped them to dismount and then led the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses away, all without a single word or</seg><seg type="columnLine">even unnecessary gesture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If it please you, Messer Matteo, follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">me," said Kafur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It matters not whether it pleases me,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">retorted Matteo. "The bird in the trap</seg><seg type="columnLine">must do as the trapper lists."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kafur stopped before an iron gate in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, one hand raised to strike a pendant</seg><seg type="columnLine">gong beside it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nay, you are free," he said. "But say</seg><seg type="columnLine">the word, and I will summon back your</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses and you may depart."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Matteo hesitated, half of a mind to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">the statement to the test.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sinan hath no use for those who fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">aught," added Kafur impartially. "If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would go, you had best go before 'tis too late."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Who said that I fear?" demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">Matteo with heat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He strode to the gate, and smote the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gong with his sword-hilt. The gate swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">open by a chain which ran through a hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the stonework.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lead on," he said. "And remember,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whoever you are, I fear nothing that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand can touch or the eye see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kafur salaamed, with a twinkle of mirth</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your pardon, lord. Your servant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">words were ill chosen. None the less, 'tis</seg><seg type="columnLine">true that you are still at liberty to go back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you wish.

Three blacks ran forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">from some unseen entrance, and stood be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore them with heads bowed and arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed on their breasts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will require rest and refreshment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Messer Matteo," said Kafur. "These are</seg><seg type="columnLine">your slaves. They will bring you whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">you wish."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought I came hither to see Sinan,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">objected Matteo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you did, lord, but you are weary."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nay, I am as ready now as I shall be</seg><seg type="columnLine">later," insisted Matteo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sinan will be glad to hear of your zeal,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied Kafur, smoothly evasive. "There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is time for you to rest and eat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that he turned upon his heel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished, giving Matteo no time for further</seg><seg type="columnLine">objections. One of the negroes lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Matteo's hand to his forehead, and mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned to the far side of the quadrangle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is naught for it but to go whither</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are led," quoth Matteo resignedly. "For</seg><seg type="columnLine">good or ill, we are her£, and must do as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are bid, Ali."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye, Messer Matteo, and keep our</seg><seg type="columnLine">swords handy," returned the old Turcople</seg><seg type="columnLine">craftily.

As evening drew on, bronze</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamps were lighted. Once Matteo walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the windows and looked out. The court-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard was dark. Not a sound drifted up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, but the pattering of the fountain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After that he had no desire to move.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A drowsy feeling stole over him. The wine</seg><seg type="columnLine">was heady and sweet; the slaves kept his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cup always full. Still, he thought, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange that he should yield to its effects so</seg><seg type="columnLine">early, he who was accustomed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carouses of Bohemond's court.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ali," he said with an effort. "Doth the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wine ring in your head?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ali, who had been silent since his second</seg><seg type="columnLine">cup, quaffed a flagon with the practised</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease of an old campaigner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">| "Nay, lord, 'tis not the wine," he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wered thickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What, then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Tis hashish, Messer Matteo.

As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank into the cushions he stretched his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">out for the sword-hilt--and a great darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanketed his mind, a darkness that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">animate in its luxurious denseness, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicious languor it inspired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In that first moment of his awaking Mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teo lay with his eyes half-closed, drinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the fragrance of the perfumes that drifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the air and the subdued melodies, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">as intangible as the odors of the flowers,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which were wafted to his ears. It was good</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lie, inert, effortless, betwixt the worlds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it were, and take joy in the pleasantness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his surroundings. But after a while</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sense of uneasiness possessed him. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something he did not understand in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">position.

Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was Ali, reposing on a couch like his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own, a kind of cushioned litter. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room was not that in which they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">feasted the night before. It was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, sunlight poured in on three sides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What does my lord wish?" asked a gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle voice behind him. "You have only to</seg><seg type="columnLine">name it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Matteo swung his feet to the marble floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked around. A girl in a costume of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shimmering, transparent stuffs, girdled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a belt of golden disks, stood smiling down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him. She was dark, with long, sheeny</seg><seg type="columnLine">black hair and tawny brown eyes, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rich tints of her rounded limbs gleamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through her draperies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are you?" he said dumbly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your slave."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where am I?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In Paradise, lord."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In Paradise!"

The fountain in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the court splashed lazily.

The body</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shoved to one side, and a member of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the band donned helmet and surcoat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the vacant post.

Then one morning came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">change.

As he walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Francois through the palace they</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the strains of music from the Hall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Audience.

His lords and knights were</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat uncomfortable spectators with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.

"King Amalric waits for it. "</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bohemond waved him impatiently away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Do it if you must, Messer Matteo.

Will you have me, comrade?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right gladly," responded Matteo. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak in a good hour.

The far-flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of battlements, the domes and towers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the churches and palaces, the close-</seg><seg type="columnLine">packed blocks of houses, stretched from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valley of Jehoshaphat to the Valley of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gehinnon, with the bulk of Mount Moriah</seg><seg type="columnLine">dominating the picture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Streams of people were pouring toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city, pilgrims from overseas, merchants</seg><seg type="columnLine">of many lands, peasants from the surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing country, knights and sergeants, squires</seg><seg type="columnLine">and men-at-arms, priests and monks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Matteo and his companions ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached the Gate of St. Stephen they ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served a look of depression, almost of fear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the faces of many beside them. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no talking. Horsemen hung their</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads. Clerks told their beads as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked. The peasants and burghers dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">played open grief, weeping and wringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Prithee, fair sir," said John the English-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to a knight of the Hospital, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of them in the line waiting to pass the</seg><seg type="columnLine">customs officers within the gate, "why is</seg><seg type="columnLine">there so great dolor this day?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Tis easy to see you have journeyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a distance, messer." responded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hospitaler.

As they passed the corner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Via Dolorosa and entered the wide square</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of the Church of the Holy Sepul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cher, they were obliged to pick a careful</seg><seg type="columnLine">path between the close-packed ranks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilgrims, who knelt at prayer for the sick</seg><seg type="columnLine">king.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The enormous hospital of tlie Knights of</seg><seg type="columnLine">St. John resounded with the chanting of</seg><seg type="columnLine">priests; but it seemed to the travelers that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knights in armor who lounged by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance wore expressions of boredom</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than piety. At the next corner, John</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Englishman, who knew the way of old,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned into the Street of David which trend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed eastward through the city toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">palace enclosure on Mount Moriah.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guards at the palace entrance halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">them while an officer of the household was</seg><seg type="columnLine">called.

John the English-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man needed no introduction. He was one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best-known men of any degree through-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out all the lands of Outremer, the hero of</seg><seg type="columnLine">innumerable desperate ventures and daring</seg><seg type="columnLine">embassies, let alone the echoing memories</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his once matchless voice and glorious</seg><seg type="columnLine">melodies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Son of Strife</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">129</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At another time no two would be more</seg><seg type="columnLine">welcome," said the chamberlain. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">today we sit and mourn; and misunderstand</seg><seg type="columnLine">me not, messers, if I say there is more call</seg><seg type="columnLine">for priests than jongleurs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certes, we would not seem to enforce</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves upon you," answered Matteo.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But I bear a message of import from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sinan, who is called the Old Man of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mountain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A message from Sinan?" repeated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamberlain in amazement.

His father had a clean scarlet</seg><seg type="columnLine">gridiron on his right flank, a tear on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hind leg, and a crimson belly. Neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked exactly like show pussies, so to speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For two minutes those sinister, secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones of the wild glared at one another, never</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving a muscle. And during that time</seg><seg type="columnLine">they worked out two facts in their subtle</seg><seg type="columnLine">feline brains. Firstly, they had fought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">live. Secondly, they must surely die if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they fought longer, for they were too well</seg><seg type="columnLine">matched for any other decision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the son imperceptibly took a step</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and finally off, insolent, deliberate, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">intractable. He had gone at last--driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">from home to fend for himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half an hour later and about a quarter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a mile away eastward, a bull moose--</seg><seg type="columnLine">they called him elk in that land--straddling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bending down a sapling for the brows-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of his supper, turned his gigantic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">antlered head suddenly, and stared with</seg><seg type="columnLine">little, keen eyes at the rigid, fading per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spective of t rees around him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw nothing, and he heard nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet, being a wild creature, he felt that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not alone any longer. His instinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered that he was being watched; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">be it mentioned, he who in the wild watches</seg><seg type="columnLine">Citizen Bull Moose at close quarters does</seg><seg type="columnLine">so with his life in pawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still, such was the watcher's skill in</seg><seg type="columnLine">woodcraft that it is doubtful whether the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bull moose, suddenly leaving his meal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">advancing with a threatening swing of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">five-foot antlers, would ever have found him</seg><seg type="columnLine">if a raven, black as a wicked thought, flap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping above the tree-tops on some rogue's</seg><seg type="columnLine">errand or other, had not come to help him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, settling, barked down vile language</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the young lynx, belly flat and rigid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind a tree-stump.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not until the moose, his hoofs clicking</seg><seg type="columnLine">like castanets as he strode high in the snow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was almost towering over him, did the lynx</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">move a hair. Then he went straight up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nearest tree as if he had been shot there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the raven shifted out of that tree as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">his life depended upon his quickness in quit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting, which, knowing the lynx, it possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing puts the cat folk into a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">evil temper than the ceaseless efforts of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bird people to advertise their vicinity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so annul their best-laid plans for con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cealment. Cats simply loathe being shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, and the bird folk spend a great deal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their time in showing them up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moose stood towering against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree-trunk, staring up at him. The lynx,</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself flat along a horizontal bough, glared</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at the moose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then suddenly his attention was diverted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quick as thought, his baleful glance had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifted, and he was staring into the branches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something had moved there, something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sinister presence had made move. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">little lump of snow fell with a soft sigh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another, higher up. It was invisible, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">something. It was a wild creature, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was keeping the trunk between it and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lynx as it climbed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently came a little commotion. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed as if some wandering eddy of wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sprung up, stirring the branches, caus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing little lumps of snow to fall from several</seg><seg type="columnLine">places at once. But there was no wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The climber, whoever he was, must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused that tiny commotion, for he stopped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the lumps of snow ceased to fall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There followed a pause, during which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lynx remained still as a beast run into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mold--all part and parcel of the bough he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the climber began his invisible up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward course again, and the commotion was</seg><seg type="columnLine">redoubled, but albeit most stealthily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the lynx saw, and, seeing, under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed as if some bird, till then in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible, had silently left the top of the tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sailed on a descending slant to the next,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where upon arrival it vanished as suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it had taken shape. Another followed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A third glided to another tree. A fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot from branch to branch of the tree he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on. Each as soon as it landed went</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, so to speak, with the same mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenness with which it had come into</seg><seg type="columnLine">being. None of them made a sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They just appeared, trapezed across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky, and vanished--utterly, like ghosts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Hungry World</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">149</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Impossible almost, in the dim snow-haze, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say what they were, if one did not know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the lynx knew. They were squirrels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quite by chance he had happened in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">midst of a band of squirrels migrating in</seg><seg type="columnLine">search of food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the invisible climber? Who was he?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was certainly death, or the squirrels</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not have "broken their freeze"'</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him in that fashion, and given them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves away to the lynx.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what death? There were many in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that forest, all cruel, all mysterious and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly all hidden. The fact that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone up, however, and not "frozen" or gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, suggested that he was at least a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lesser death than the lynx.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon that deduction the lynx acted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE DID not so much move along</seg><seg type="columnLine">that branch as coax himself to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree-bole. He peered cautiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">round, staring upward, and he surprized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">climber at its climbing. It was a long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinuous, exquisitely coated sable. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">following the squirrels upon their migration,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for upon them it lived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Possibly they had not known that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">existed till the lynx, himself unknowing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had surprised it at its stalking; just as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">raven and the bull moose had surprized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lynx at his. Neither party concerned</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked pleased; the squirrels, being the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely to suffer, looking least pleased of all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the lynx acted. It was character-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istic of him, possibly of all cats, that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">delivered his ultimatum suddenly. Sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prize was the essence of his tactics. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot straight up the tree-bole at that sable</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a living gray bolt--with one clean,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleaving spring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the same instant the bull moose</seg><seg type="columnLine">snorted--nay, almost whistled--while a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">capercaillie three feet long, and sending</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his seventeen pounds' weight along with</seg><seg type="columnLine">every ounce of power in his big wings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtled above their heads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The effect of these two things, upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lynx especially, was extraordinary. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard them after he started his spring, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he changed his mind. He seemed to twist</seg><seg type="columnLine">his whole body in midair, with a wrench</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was visible, and he came down again</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the very spot that he had started</seg><seg type="columnLine">from, like some great india-rubber ball.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was just in time to hear a fox bark</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sudden, gutteral warning, to see the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sloping hindquarters and spreading, pal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mated antlers of the moose fade swiftly into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pigeon-blue-gray haze between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranked tree-boles, and to note that squir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rels and sable alike had dissolved them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves, as if by magic, into nowhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rebounded, almost without touching it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the bough he had returned to, full ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel down to the ground, and then went</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the snow as hard as he could go, leap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing enormously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A wolf came by, going like the wind, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a white hare passed also. Both were ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viously pressed for time, and took no notice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of each other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some disturbance back behind made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lynx glance over his shoulder as he bounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">from some death unknowrn which the action</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the other wild folk told him was greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">than he; and what he saw sent him up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next tree. Three dogs were coming through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest, and dogs, he knew, spelled man</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewThere behind them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dogs ran straight to the tree the lynx</seg><seg type="columnLine">had just left, and stopped. Then they</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to bay furiously, and their voices rang</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They knew their job, those dogs. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had bayed the sable; his skin was money.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So did the lynx know his job; his skin was</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, too. He had become part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree he was on apparently. He seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have melted into the lines of the wood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anon, to the dogs added itself the figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a man on a horse, galloping. He came</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the dusk in a raw, red light, subdued</seg><seg type="columnLine">and churchlike among the trees. He dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted and looked up the tree the sable</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on. Then he led his horse some dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance aw'ay, returned, did something-</seg><seg type="columnLine">magic, for all the lynx knew, as he watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">with eyes that burned a faint green light--</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a circle which included both trees, called</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dogs off, retired among the tree-trunks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and--faded into the dusk. He had gone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">presumably, without doing anything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lynx waited half an hour, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest remained as silent and lifeless as mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean, and he concluded that that man</seg><seg type="columnLine">presumably had not gone.

What each sunrise</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant to Joe Monkeyface only he and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Creator knew. When Cardiff chose to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammer the lad, sending him on deck to</seg><seg type="columnLine">face the second mate with his snarling grin</seg><seg type="columnLine">painfully accentuated by cut lips, Mr. Earl</seg><seg type="columnLine">chose to ignore his hurts; for his own hurts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were sore yet, and would be for a long time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after what the captain had told him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And yet Joe Monkeyface was not wholly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whipped cur he appeared. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a morning, a dead, stinking morning, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea and skv had died and rotted from lack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wind and the ship beat her heart out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slimy hillocks of blindingly glassy</seg><seg type="columnLine">wastes.

He grappled for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nearest hold as the scalding porridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">nipped his almost naked flesh, and brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in his fall a boiler of boiling salt water</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for the immersion of the salt horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the noon dinner of the other watch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor's yells were lusty enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring every man within reach stampeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the door. That they hoped to find him</seg><seg type="columnLine">weltering in his dying gore perhaps ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">counted for their alacrity; for ship's cook</seg><seg type="columnLine">never went to sea in windjammers whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">life was not greatly desired by the majority</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rabble he had to cook for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Joe dropped his mess-kids with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash, burst in through the door, and, heed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less of the searing, scalding mixture that</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit at his ankles, dragged out the cook and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped him on deck. When the watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered around, Joe was standing shivering</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fear, mess-kids in hand, gazing down</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the spilled and spoiled burgoo that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have filled his dishes. Then he abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumbled to the deck, his scalded feet re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusing longer to sustain him, and by his fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped the terrific wallop aimed at his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Cardiff, furious at the delay with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't understand that boy at all,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">growled the captain as he rummaged in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">medicine-chest for unguents and bandages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can, I think sir," returned Mr. Earl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Take a close look at his face, and you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">find that what you take to be pitiful is</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply currish meanness.

When able to carry on with his work</seg><seg type="columnLine">again Joe had recovered vastly from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">earlier terrors, and the second mate took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">keener interest than even the captain seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to; and when one breezy afternoon Joe went</seg><seg type="columnLine">overboard without hesitation to save the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mangy ship's cat Mr. Earl cast out of mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">any lingering doubt and set to work to dig</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the soul of the unlovely waif.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That daring plunge into the sea, besides</seg><seg type="columnLine">causing a call for all hands to heave the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">to and lower away a boat, showed that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were some things at least incapable of bring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the glare of terror into the eyes of Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monkeyface. Not even when the ship was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailing on, before heaving to, leaving him</seg><seg type="columnLine">astern in mid-sea with a clawing, spitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow fury in one hand, did the lad's face</seg><seg type="columnLine">show fear; rather the ugly features were</seg><seg type="columnLine">illuminated almost to beauty by a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">high courage that compared grotesquely</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his usual expression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What ever made you so scared of a -</seg><seg type="columnLine">beating, Joe?" the second mate asked one</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog-watch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe was laboriously poring over a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass card given him to study by the skipper;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to keep himself clear of ribald inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruption from the men, he was seated on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poop bucket-rack. At the question the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurking fear again crept into the lad's face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he shivered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're plucky enough in other things,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursued Mr. Earl. "You're getting hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">as nails, too. Why don't you set about</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the brutes who keep after you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe Monkeyface shivered more painfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made no reply. The compass card</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped from his shaking fingers, and Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earl picked it up and handed it to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He tried another tack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me how vou got that queer name,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The officer's tone was kindly, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly spoken words seemed to soothe some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Joe's fears. He shot a swift glance up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward at Mr. Earl's face, then lowered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and said dully:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I never knowed no different name, sir.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ain't it a good 'un for the likes o' me?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly he raised his head again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">presented a full view of his beetle-browed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugliness.

He wondered now how he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever mistook the pitiful expression of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lad for inherent or acquired meanness, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly resolved to take upon himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he conceived to be Captain Deshay's</seg><seg type="columnLine">intention, the development of this waif of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city streets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen, Joe," he said, "when the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">have hammered you, didn't you ever hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">back?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old whining note crept back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe's voice.

Joe appeared not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice that he was left alone; but he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">readily enough that he had displeased the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second mate, and even the captain looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him queerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better let him sail his own traverse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir," Earl told the captain.

Sailing far south, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">near to a full great circle as the Crozets and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kerguelen Land would allow, winds were</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong, seas high, and ice frequent. Double</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">handed wheels, constant look-out, wet quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters and decks too often swept for any work</seg><seg type="columnLine">other than sheltered work to be done, men</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no time for idle horseplay; that is a *</seg><seg type="columnLine">resource for the lazy tropic weeks, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm sun and full fare make hot blood and</seg><seg type="columnLine">devilment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the chill bitterness of the incessant</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold and wet frightened Joe, and the skipper</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw it. He put the lad in the galley to help</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cook. The warmth and comparative dry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness soon put renewed confidence into Joe;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and very quickly the doctor, whose memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">for services rendered was weak, put most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the work upon him, forgetting or ignoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that Joe had saved him from very</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious hurts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe's initial awkwardness was not helped</seg><seg type="columnLine">or lessened either by friendly advice or by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giddy gymnastics of the ship running</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the howling westerlies.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snow stopped, leaving walls of ghostly</seg><seg type="columnLine">green and a floor of sighing black water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Overhead, high overhead, hung a star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">studded canopy of black, over which a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">puff of fleecy cloud drifted languorously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crest of the berg seemed to move</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently against the slow-moving clouds; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon sailed into the space overhead</seg><seg type="columnLine">and illumined the vast ice cavern in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe was cast, into the semblance of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sublime cathedral with the organ of old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune himself playing a soft anthem of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapping seas, only to have the anthem put</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of tune by the discordant skra-aw-awk</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a wheeling mollymawk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Joe was concerned more nearly with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sight of two black specks clinging pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cariously to a finger-breadth ledge of ice on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opposite side of the ice harbor. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">space was a full fifty yards across, yet he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear the labored breathing of Cardiff</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he fought stubbornly to haul Mr. Earl</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the sea far enough for him to get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger-grip to support himself. As for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second mate, he appeared to be either dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">or entirely helpless, for he hung a dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight in Cardiff's grip, making no effort to</seg><seg type="columnLine">assist his rescuer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> joe uttered a rasping howl of encourage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and plunged once more into the freez-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing water.

As</seg><seg type="columnLine">he trudgeoned across he uttered whistling</seg><seg type="columnLine">cries of apprehension that were made</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange to absurdity by the chattering of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his teeth and his frenzied fears for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend.

But Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earl breathed, miraculously; and Joe Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keyface sprang up, shuffled clumsily with</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-frozen feet and uttered a piercing shriek</seg><seg type="columnLine">of triumph that echoed and reechoed among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glittering spires of the icy cathedral like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred voices in chorus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the rest of the night, only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few hours, Joe worked as man never worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">before over a man so far gone as Mr. Earl</seg><seg type="columnLine">was. Crude though his knowledge was, Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed in warmth, and his efforts were</seg><seg type="columnLine">directed toward putting animation into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">still limbs he toiled at. Arms, legs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then chest and stomach were in turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumped and kneaded, worked frenziedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the glittering eyes of half-frantic Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monkeyface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And just at dawn, to save himself from</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling from exhaustion, Joe stood up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelled defiance to the rising sun, dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">madly, uncouthly, - to restore his waning</seg><seg type="columnLine">circulation as well as to announce to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world that he had seen a flicker in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend's eyelids. '</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the sun came up, shining through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow pass from the eastward ocean, warm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing gradually the piercing chill and bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the castaway the knowledge that to live</seg><seg type="columnLine">he must eat, or at least drink. He propped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Earl up with his own coat and staggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the pass, seeking for anything, but'</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing of nothing he might expect to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">in such a place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he reached one horn of the narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass he saw a tiny trickle of water coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">down from some high pinnacle that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched earlier by the rising sun, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">scooped up a poor half-pint in his cap.

"Three-Finger" was too com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon a cognomen, therefore some one had</seg><seg type="columnLine">invented a new one, "Short-Hand," and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name had stuck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And with his trigger finger gone the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all flesh, Mr. Conway had been forced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">develop another style of handling a Colt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a file he had removed certain parts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mechanism from his old single-action</seg><seg type="columnLine">.41, and with constant practise had devel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oped an almost uncanny skill in thumbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hammer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But times had changed; the day of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunman was passing, and when in town Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conway had made concession to the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventionalities by carrying his Colt inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">his belt, tucked between his trousers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt, with the bottom of his vest concealing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the butt of the weapon. There had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">method and "safety-first" in this conceal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment; a decade-old grudge had still re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained unsettled between Mr. Conway and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fire-eating gunman known as "Slaughter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house" Flanagan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Conway, now in his late fifties, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen into certain settled habits, of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">one in particular is worthy of being set</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. Each Monday he would partake of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one lone drink of whisky; on Tuesdays he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would indulge in two; Wednesday was</seg><seg type="columnLine">worthy of three; Thursday called for foiir;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Friday was the day of five drinks; and Sat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">urday was celebrated by an even half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen. Sunday was the day of drought--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a belligerent state of mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And it had been on a Sunday that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridden into Dos Pinos, and for the first time</seg><seg type="columnLine">in ten years had chanced to meet with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slaughterhouse Flanagan, who was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cock-o'-the-walk in the town, being the pet</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunman of certain influential county poli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticians. Flanagan had failed to recognize</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ancient enemy--a fatal error. Sunday</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Dos Pinos was invariably a slow day, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Flanagan had attempted to speed it up</seg><seg type="columnLine">by taking advantage of Mr. Conway's mild</seg><seg type="columnLine">and inoffensive appearance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Conway's reply had been short,</seg><seg type="columnLine">extremely profane and highly insulting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thereupon Mr. Flanagan had rashly</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached for his Colt.

Times had indeed</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed. Having incurred the enmity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the political powers, he would stand no</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance at all of a fair trial. He was a poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">trout who had swallowed the hook, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">zealous district attorney was the skilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">fisherman who would reel him in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Mr. Conway at birth had been en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dowed with a large amount of Irish wit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which a couple of scores of years of precari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous and sometimes doubtful living as a gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had supplemented with a large amount</seg><seg type="columnLine">of guile. At one time he had made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">statement that brains would do more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamite to get a man out of jail. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">right now he had a grand chance to try out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The jailer was a nervous man, and of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Conway brutally took advantage. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">two days he threatened to commit suicide.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deliberately, as long as the prison official</seg><seg type="columnLine">would listen, he verbally drew gruesome</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictures of himself with his throat cut from</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear to ear. He succeeded in getting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jailer's goat, so much so that the official</seg><seg type="columnLine">refused to allow his morbid captive the use</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a knife or a fork. Mr. Conway was forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to eat with a pewter spoon, and even this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was taken away from him after each meal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The third day was Sunday, and Sunday</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Dos Pinos jail was the day of corn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">starch pudding for dessert. Corn-starch</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one of Mr. Conway's pet abominations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but this time he had use for it. He lathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face with pudding and sprinkled this</seg><seg type="columnLine">with dust gathered from the corners of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cell. His large bandanna provided the</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed loop. With a short knot at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ends he tied the cloth over one of the bars</seg><seg type="columnLine">that formed part of the grilled ceiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The jailer's footstep in the corridor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the signal for Mr. Conway to stand erect on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bunk, slip his head through the loop of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bandanna and crook his knees. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">jailer, missing Mr. Conway's usual gibing</seg><seg type="columnLine">invitation for another poker game, stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and peered through the bars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gasped in horror. Mr. Conway appar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ently had carried out his threat of suicide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by hanging himself. With hasty, fumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers the official unlocked and entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cell. A closer look in the dim light at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corn-starch-and-dust-plastered face of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner proved all too convincing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hastily backing out of the cell, he started</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a matter of habit to lock the door. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">why lock up a dead man? The keys slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his nervous fingers. He snatched</seg><seg type="columnLine">them up and fled toward the front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building. A moment later sounded the slam</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the outer door. The jailer was scurry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing toward the coroner's office, half a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time he had returned with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">official investigator of deaths, Mr. Conway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having regained his horse, his Winchester</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his Colt, and carrying a huge grin, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">two miles out of town and going strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the Colorado River.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"NO, SIR-REE!" said the rancher.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Fifty bucks is my price, and it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth it. You ain't payin' me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent to keep my mouth shut, understand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but my skiff leaks--some--and that makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">it a gamble worth the money--to me. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">take a look at that river."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Conway looked, then glanced appre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hensively back across the desert hills to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastward. Again his gaze turned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three-quarter-mile-wide, swirling, surging,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow flood-waters of the Colorado. Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conway was no navigator; the stretch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">eddying water made him feel helpless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's your fifty--if we can start now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure we can. Put your stuff in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Conway hastened to unsaddle his</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse and place the saddle, blankets and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle in the fragile twelve-foot skiff. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was some slight difficulty in getting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse to take to the water. The rancher</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally dragged him in and fastened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the reins to a nail in the stern of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat. Then, with the horse swimming be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind and towed by the reins, they started</seg><seg type="columnLine">for California, the rancher at the oars and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Conway busy with an empty tomato-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can bailing to keep the skiff afloat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half-way across, the strain on the reins</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent the nail. The horse, freed from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat, started back for the Arizona shore.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Catching him was no easy task, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal turned away each time the rancher</seg><seg type="columnLine">maneuvered the craft into a position for</seg><seg type="columnLine">162</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Conway to grab the bridle. At last</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rancher cut off the painter. Mr. Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way used this as a riata and roped the swim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming horse. Just in time, too, for the frantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal was within fifty feet of the shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The leaky skiff was now half-filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. Mr. Conway tied the loose end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the painter around his waist, and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting a record for fast bailing with a toma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-can.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a thicket of willows four miles below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the starting-point the skiff literally bumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into California. With solid land again be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath his boots, Mr. Conway pulled out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandanna and mopped the sweat of appre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hension from his face. He had been scared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he admitted it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say, you sure earned your coin," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "But who's gonna bail the water out</seg><seg type="columnLine">goin' back?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Golly! I never thought of that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rancher's face was a study in emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Conway grinned, saddled up and rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">away to the westward, leaving the rancher</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratching his head over the problem.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twenty-four hours later Mr. Conway</seg><seg type="columnLine">cocked an eye aloft at the desert sun and</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided that it was time to eat. But "eats"</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not to be obtained, for his horse lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead some six miles distant back toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Colorado. The skittish animal had</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed one aversion, namely, horned</seg><seg type="columnLine">toads. When, during the night before, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the harmless little creatures had crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his path, the horse had shied and leaped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side. This side leap on rocky ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">had caused a bad fall. One hoof had wedged</seg><seg type="columnLine">between two rocks, and the fall had snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">a foreleg. And to make it worse, the horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fallen upon and smashed flat the can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen that Mr. Conway had purchased from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the friendly rancher.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sight of the smashed canteen had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the effect of increasing Mr. Conway's thirst.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therefore at daybreak, after shooting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse, he had set out in search of a spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to desert travelers as "The Frog</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hole." He had found the water, such as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, but now regretted his lack of foresight</seg><seg type="columnLine">in neglecting to take with him the scanty</seg><seg type="columnLine">rations that were in a gunnysack tied to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle. Six miles back to the horse, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">six miles on the return journey to the spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">would mean twelve miles without water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Conway decided to wait until the heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the day had abated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gazed around and spat in disgust as</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eye met nothing but an arid sun-baked</seg><seg type="columnLine">waste of sand and fantastic rock formation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So this is California, land of milk, honey</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lots of money! Oh, well, it might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse," he cogitated, then centered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind on a nice problem, namely: Would</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pangs of hunger eventually prove</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharper than the ache of blistered feet?</seg><seg type="columnLine">The answer can not be set in type.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morosely he surveyed the mangy, purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">heights of the Wolftooth Mountains, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay thirty miles distant across a burning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat-eddying desert caldron. In the canons</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Wolftooths lay safety and--cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. No California officer would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely to look for him there, in the event that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Arizona authorities had telegraphed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">information that the much wanted "Short-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hand" Conway had succeeded in crossing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Colorado.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Conway retraced his steps to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water-hole, drank a little of the nauseatingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm, stagnant fluid, then pulled out a limp</seg><seg type="columnLine">muslin bag and nursed the last few tobacco</seg><seg type="columnLine">crumbs into a very slender cigaret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Golly," he cogitated, gazing distastefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the spot where the water slowly oozed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from some subterranean source, "that stuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">runs about two per cent, pure niter. Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it ain't gonna hurt me--much. And it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet anyway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again he cursed the tragic mishap of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed canteen, a scurvy trick of fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had effectually marooned him on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">small island of dampness in the midst of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sea of eddying heat-waves which stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the limit of vision and turned into life-</seg><seg type="columnLine">and-hope-stealing illusions and mirages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With no food and no tobacco to comfort</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, in the course of another hour the heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a few pestiferous flies had succeeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly in souring whatever milk of</seg><seg type="columnLine">human kindness remained in his system.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Any man on horseback who approached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water-hole was due to bump into some con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrated hard luck--for himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another hour passed, and Mr. Conway's</seg><seg type="columnLine">frame of mind had curdled still more, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">far out on the shimmering desert a cloud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust caught his apathetic gaze. A little</seg><seg type="columnLine">later the cloud resolved itself into a horse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man driving two pack-animals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hope has set records for high jumping,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Mr. Conway's breast stirred but little.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where, a couple of hours back, he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">unhesitatingly have committed even murder</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reverse Irish</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to get out of his desperate position, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was inclined to moderation. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been given time to think. So far he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">committed no offense, against the law in</seg><seg type="columnLine">California, and the latter State was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanctuary which he now had no desire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">violate. Therefore he put on a deep-sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking act.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally he grinned, and began hastily'to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pile up small boulders. His final work of</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparation was to fish up the stub of a pen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cil and upon a cigaret paper write some</seg><seg type="columnLine">cryptic words and figures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His labors finished, Mr. Conway grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, wickedly this time, as he gazed toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the approaching rider, now less than half</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mile distant. Hope was leaping high, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Conway was lying low--behind a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few minutes later he arose abruptly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Menacingly in his hand was the old Colt .41</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Better git!" he warned the horseman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's open season for claim-jumpers!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The newcomer turned for a hostile-eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">glare at the interrupter of passage to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water-hole.

He looked into Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conway's mild and sad blue eyes, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">features relaxed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Reg'lar desert wolf, ain't you?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned. "What's the game?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He noted Mr. Conway's position, the pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of a skilled gunman, a snap shot.

By that he knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trigger evidently had been filed from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun.

I'm not</seg><seg type="columnLine">stickin' you up to git them, understand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know my rights, and I'm keepin' you cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered because you're trespassin'. I ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">takin' no chances on having my claim</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped, so just drop your six-gun into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust. To use more than one thumb and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one finger will be a sure way of providing me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with more hosses than I need. Don't take</seg><seg type="columnLine">any chances, son; I can let daylight through</seg><seg type="columnLine">you before you can bat an eye."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The affair so far had not gone quite to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Conway's liking. He knew the horse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man could be more deadly than a rattle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">snake. The stranger was in his early</seg><seg type="columnLine">164</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thirties; but his face, even when he flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ready grin, was hard. And his eyes now</seg><seg type="columnLine">were harder than onyx, and as dark. But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his nonchalance that was disconcerting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm willing to oblige," he drawlingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied, "but I sure hate to get the gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">jammed full of sand. Come and get it, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">let me hand it to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Conway's eyes flicked several times.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was better. Inwardly he began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grin. He would let the other man see just</seg><seg type="columnLine">how far his contemplated trick would go</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an old gunman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"HUH!" he grunted. "You ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">lackin' any sand, that's a hog-tied</seg><seg type="columnLine">cinch," admiringly. "Reckon I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to humor you till we get better ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quainted. Give me the gun."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stepped forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other gingerly pulled out his Colt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flipped it in the air and caught it by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrel, but as he caught it Mr. Conway's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun poked him in the ribs. Mr. Conway's</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hand reached up and took the weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">butt first as it was extended to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By a forced smile the horseman gamely</seg><seg type="columnLine">acknowledged defeat.^ Mr. Conway flipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the cylinder, ejected the shells, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned the weapon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put it back in the holster and try it over</seg><seg type="columnLine">again," he invited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other man rather sheepishly hol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stered the Colt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Say," he blurted out, "how many</seg><seg type="columnLine">notches on your gun?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Too many," confessed Mr. Conway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let's see you roll it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here goes! I guess I'll look like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">amateur to an old-timer like you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stranger started to hand his Colt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">butt foremost, to his captor. Mr. Conway</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached tentatively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a flash, in a bare fraction of a second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun reversed, and snapped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fast--fast!" was the compliment. "Son,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've sure wasted your youth in practising</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. It ain't worth while any more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Conway walked around to the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the horse, again pressed his Colt</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the other's ribs and pulled a .30-30</seg><seg type="columnLine">carbine from the saddle scabbard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, son, I'm gonnajmake you a propo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sition. For water out of your canteen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ride on a pack-hoss your bronks can use</seg><seg type="columnLine">my private water-hole."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">As Mr. Conway glanced toward the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">spring his jaw dropped in chagrin. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">pack animals, unwatched by him, had stolen</seg><seg type="columnLine">a march. They were now drinking from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water-hole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Blisterin' heck!" he ejaculated in dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gust. "That scheme is two-thirds shot full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of holes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sized up the pack-horses. One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, a sorrel, was long-legged, rangy in</seg><seg type="columnLine">build. With knowing eye its points were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sized up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How much do you want for the sorrel</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone-yard? I'd like to buy him if the price</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't too steep."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Buy him! You're sure an uncertain</seg><seg type="columnLine">liombre. First you hold me up, then you</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to buy a horse."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold up nothin'!" disavowed Mr. Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. "I told you I was only makin' sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you wa'n't gonna jump my claim.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howr much for the sorrel?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I might sell him for sixty--some day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I need him right now. Got to rush that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff into the Wolftooth country. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderin' why you don't steal one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I never was a hoss-thief!" was the retort.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And they ain't no warrants out ag'in' me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in California, so I ain't gonna borrow trou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble--unless I just gotta do it to git away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the rider flashed his ready grin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All the while he had been subjecting Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conway to minute scrutiny. He had noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the missing trigger finger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shot off?" he inquired casually, his gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the gun hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe!" grunted Mr. Conway, puzzled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensing that the question was more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">casual.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Three years ago--below the border?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed another query.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe it did--and then again, maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">it did."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other's smile turned quizzical.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You seem to fit the description of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Short-Hand Conway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That so?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right!" laughed the other. "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad you admit it so freely. That time you</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped in and saved Whitey Dunnigan</seg><seg type="columnLine">from being turned into mince-meat by-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Aw, shucks! Five Mexes wa'n't so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much," growled the embarrassed Mr. Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One of them got your trigger meat-hook</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway. You see, I've sort of been classing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Re.verse Irish</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you as a guy I'd be willing to do a good turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">for.

But who in heck are you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Carroll--Bob Carroll. Is the stick-up</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing still on, or do I get my guns back?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm sorry I called you those names."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't let that worry you. I'll save them</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and use them on somebody else. About</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guns--Bob Carroll doesn't spell any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to me. Never heard of you before--</seg><seg type="columnLine">under that name. Aw, heck, sure you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the guns back. It wouldn't do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">any good to smoke me up--or try to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And calling it a stick-up is all wrong.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was only protecting my claim from being</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped. Get that right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have it your own way," laughed Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll. "You were trying to jump the price of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, too, but I won't hold that against</seg><seg type="columnLine">you--seeing that things are as they are."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I only tried to boost it," was the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention. "And it didn't work out worth the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feathers on a lizard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carroll dismounted, shook hands with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conway and regained his weapons. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to le^ad his saddle-horse toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water-hole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say, got any tobacco to spare?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carroll turned to answer the question.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sure! Lots of it. Go and get a can out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a saddle-bag."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Conway started toward the pack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals. He stopped and inquired--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Which hoss?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The sorrel, I think. Both cayuses have</seg><seg type="columnLine">light loads so's I could make fast time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On each pack-saddle were hung rawhide</seg><seg type="columnLine">bags, each slightly smaller in dimensions</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a kero^ene-case holding two five-gallon</seg><seg type="columnLine">cans. The dry hide was as stiff as boards;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edges of the bags were square like boxes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bags were open at the top, but small</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarpaulins covered both saddles and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">loads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Conway removed the tarpaulin from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sorrel, and from one bag dragged out</seg><seg type="columnLine">three sides of bacon, a ten-pound sack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flour and a cloth bag filled with dried beans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This uncovered the bottom layer. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">tobacco was revealed, but the other con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tents served to arouse and hold the search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er's interest. There was a layer of card-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board boxes, each containing twenty rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">cartridges. And the boxes numbered at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least fifteen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cafroll looked up from the water-hole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Guess the tobacco's on the other side,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	he announced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After replacing the provisions in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">saddle-bag, Mr. Conway ducked around to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the other side of the horse. This time he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">discovered the tobacco tins, a dozen of them,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and then dug further to verify his suspicions</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as to the bottom layer in the second bag.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was composed of even more cartridge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">boxes than the other. The horse carried at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">least seven hundred rounds of ammunition!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Among other things, Mr. Conway pos-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sessed a responsive imagination. Seven</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hundred rifle cartridges! And perhaps</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there were as many more on the other pack-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">horse! That meant action--somewhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A private war undoubtedly. He imagined</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he felt an itch in the spot where once his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hand had been normal in the possession of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a nervous trigger finger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Mr. Conway sighed, bestirred himself</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gathering fuel and started a fire. Presently</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">t*he two men squatted down to a menu of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bacon, fried biscuits and coffee. The horses</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grazed near by on cacti.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Luther Burbank is famed, among other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">achievements, for having rendered cactus</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">available for fodder, by removing the spines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He used science. Mr. Conway obtained the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">same result with a hatchet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Mr. Carroll rolled another cigaret, lighted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> it.by borrowing Mr. Conway's glowing stub,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> then leaned back into the scanty shade of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a yucca.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "You particularly stressed the fact that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there are no warrants out against you in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">California," he began. "Not to get per-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sonal--you don't have to answer--are you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on the dodge from Arizona or Nevada?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Maybe!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Mr. Conway grew wary-eyed and unob-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trusively moved his leg to bring his holster</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into a handier position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Well, old-timer, it's all right with me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I might be able to help you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "I'll admit there's no warrants out ag'in'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> me in California, which ain't what you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> might call an incriminatin' admission.

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   There was a decided gleam of interest in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Carroll's eyes, followed by th'e birth of an idea</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that caused him to cough--or something.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you want to settle down, eh?

I'm in wrong with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bunch of side-windin' politicians across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creek because I just naturally had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bump off their hired gunman. That's all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I might mention that I ran a whopper of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rannygazoo on the jailer and made a dean</seg><seg type="columnLine">getaway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So that's it," mused Mr. Carroll aloud.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I was wondering why you were on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodge.

There was quite a flurry in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">San Berdoo prospecting circles, as you might</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">put it, and-knows how many parties</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have tried to find the rich strike. None of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The old man finally recovers his mind,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but he's been too ailing to take another</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">desert trip. His family in San Berdoo have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been nursing him for years. Before he died</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">last month he drew a map absolutely locat-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing the lost mine. His son, Harry, grew up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the mean time, and he was to set out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and recoup the family fortunes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The boy figures on starting from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Needles. He gets on the train with his out-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fit, but the night before he's ready to start</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he takes a few drinks and talks too much.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Yucca Kid bumped him off and stole</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the map. A flock of witnesses saw the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">killing, and when the news was wired to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">San Berdoo, Summers loads his posse and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reverse Irish</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">horses into a baggage-car and 'Santa Fes' in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hurry to Needles. From there we trailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kid and bottled him up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now we've got to play a waiting game.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's sure death to go after him. He and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his partner can make a Winchester speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">any language. One of our deputies, Ike</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flint, got potted at three hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">with nothing but his forehead showing above"</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rock--a plumb center shot. Summers will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be glad to swear you in in Ike's place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We're going to stay on the job till we</seg><seg type="columnLine">finish it; that's why I went into Needles for</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Conway reviewed the situation. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">liked it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And if I git depitized by Summers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">make good, that'll kinda establish my stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on this side of the Colorado, hey?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure as shooting! Summers is square.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If he takes you on, he'll have a convenient</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapse of memory if any warrants float across</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Arizona. It's your chance to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fresh start."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time there was silence. Mr. Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way finally squinted at the sun. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting to cross the blistering thirty-mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretch at night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quite a spell to sundown," he remarked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Got a deck of cards?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure! Couple of new decks I was bring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the boys. How about a little game of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stud?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suits me," said Mr. Conway, secretly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rejoicing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Carroll felt the same way, having not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slightest doubt but that within a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he would be able to pocket all the funds</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried by the other man. It might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned that when not engaged in other</seg><seg type="columnLine">work--work involving the use of a gun and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerve--Mr. Carroll kept up with the over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head by his ability to make a deck of cards</seg><seg type="columnLine">say "uncle" when speech was desired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The game began, with rifle cartridges for</seg><seg type="columnLine">chips. At sundown Mr. Conway possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over three hundred in cash, three horses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their loads and equipment and about every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else in sight. Mr. Carroll was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">owner of a vague suspicion, the clothes he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore, and the right to talk to himself. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">his six-gun now belonged to the better man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He managed to smile, however, even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smile had a southerly twist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You sure hooked me, old-timer, and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want you to help me out. Summers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bunch will laugh themselves sick if they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">find out that I got beaten at stud and lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the shells I was bringing in. It'll be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">worse than that; Summers will raise-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with fancy trimmings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The horses were mine, and suppose you</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride the pinto till we get close to camp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I want you to favor me by changing</seg><seg type="columnLine">off and riding the sorrel. That'll let me out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, with the bunch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've got your own guns, so you won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have use for mine. For them and the sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plies and the pack-horses I'll be owing you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, three hundred bucks. You keep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinto and the saddle; I can tell the bunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I sold them to you. Savvy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, that's all right," Mr. Conway</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastened to assure him. "You owe me</seg><seg type="columnLine">three hundred; let it go at that. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to get you into trouble with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff." Pause. "Let's get started."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT DAYBREAK, in the foothills</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Wolftooth, they stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">long enough to boil coffee and fry</seg><seg type="columnLine">bacon. Then followed three hours of hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">going. The trail wound up through deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">canons, climbed ridges, descended into</seg><seg type="columnLine">veritable mazes of gullies and climbed again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They paused to breathe the horses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say," propounded Mr. Conway, "what</seg><seg type="columnLine">good is a mine up here? They can never</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the machinery in, and it wouldn't pay</seg><seg type="columnLine">to carry the ore out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No? That ore is so danged rich that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a burro-load will be worth fifteen hundred</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">or so. A couple of hundred burros-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fifteen hundred! Golly, there might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions in it. No wonder there's been kill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings over it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And there's liable to be more of them,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">added Carroll.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time they were in a canon that</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed signs of widening. Soon it opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a basin, perhaps twenty acres in size.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The flat was rich in grass, and three horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">grazed, restrained by hobbles. A brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribbon of green marked the course of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring trickling down the hillside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Part way up the eastern slope of the basin</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazed a camp-fire. Two men were in sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better let me go on ahead," suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carroll. "I want to talk Summers into</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking you on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Conway showed alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Make it good and strong," he begged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I sure do want to get a stand-in with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Leave it to me, old-timer," replied Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Conway watched him ride up the hill</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dismount near the fire. One of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men approached, pointed with an obviously</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry gesture down the hill, then put his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms akimbo, and waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carroll began talking. Soon, as Mr. Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way watched, it was evident that Carroll's</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk was having effect. The attitude of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry one relaxed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned and shouted up the hill. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">response to this summons three men ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared at widely separated points among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks on the crest. All of them carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifles. Two hurried down to the fire; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third disappeared again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Followed a short conversation; then Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll turned and beckoned. Mr. Conway</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastened up the hill, forcing the sorrel in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerness to get on the right side of the law.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sized up the four strangers. One in</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular, the man with whom Carroll had</seg><seg type="columnLine">argued, was the type that Mr. Conway's</seg><seg type="columnLine">experienced eye labeled--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Deadly!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Physically he was not impressive, being</seg><seg type="columnLine">of medium height and build. But he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin-faced, sharp-nosed, lantern-jawed; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands betrayed restlessness. Mr. Conway</seg><seg type="columnLine">recalled another sheriff of this type, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent of the law in a certain border county</seg><seg type="columnLine">a score of years back, a man who depended</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon nervous energy and speed rather than</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical force, fast as a flash on the draw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a ruthless killer when it came to a show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">down with outlaws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Conway swung off his horse, eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiously by the members of the posse, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of whom were grinning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sheriff, this is Short-Hand Conway,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Carroll's introduction. "And, Conway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guy with the beauty spots called freckles</seg><seg type="columnLine">is 'Speck' Malone. This is Bill Hargis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the bird with the insipid grizzly-bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">grin is 'Sandy' Bowen. 'Pinkeye' Sweitzer is</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching the canon. You'll meet him later."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After shaking hands with each in turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Conway's gaze returned to the sheriff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked into close-set, clear, cold, gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes in which lay a smoldering, enigmatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">light that reminded him of a pet puma he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen in Prescott. Summers spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bob tells me that you can beat him on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the draw, and that you're the fellow who</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved Whitey Dunnigan down in Cananea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He says he's explained the situation here to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you, and he's told me of what you're up</seg><seg type="columnLine">against. Do you want to join us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I sure do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's fine!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Conway noted a brief flicker in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff's eyes. It might have been a hint of</seg><seg type="columnLine">amusement, a smile of satisfaction or a show</seg><seg type="columnLine">of liking and friendliness. Mr. Conway did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not stop to analyze, for Summers continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking:	--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll have your work cut out for you--</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make good with me. Come along and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll show you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Conway followed the officer up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill. He noted at the same time that Carroll</seg><seg type="columnLine">started toward the spot where, a few min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes before, the fifth man of the posse had</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared among the rocks. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">summit the sheriff ducked low and sidled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up behind a rock. Mr. Conway imitated</seg><seg type="columnLine">his caution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take a look," invited Summers, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodge back quick and look again from</seg><seg type="columnLine">another place. They shoot to kill--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they make center shots if you give them</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Conway raised his head above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of the rock. Below him lay a small val-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley, from three to four hundred yards in</seg><seg type="columnLine">width and half a mile in length. Both ends</seg><seg type="columnLine">were closed by perpendicular walls, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">northern one at least one hundred feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">height, the southern one perhaps forty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The eastern side was a bulk of sheer tower-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing cliff. It was apparent at a glance that</seg><seg type="columnLine">three sides of the valley offered no hope of</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape for the outlaws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the foot of the opposite cliff was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth of a tunnel, where old Florenden had</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasted and burrowed as he followed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stringer leading into the big vein of gold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rocks and earth lay heaped in a semi-circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of the tunnel, and from the shelter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this debris a Winchester suddenly spat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A jagged bit of stone flew up and sent Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conway's hat sailing. "Whee-e-e," sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weird scream of a flattened bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">"diminuendoing" westward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Conway dropped back to shelter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I told you to dodge pronto,'1' Summers</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked in a matter-of-fact tone. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was poor shooting--for them. Must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed by four or five inches. Now you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">see what we're up against. We've got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">starve them out, and how long that'll take</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a problem. I'm due back in San Bernar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dino before this."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reverse Irish</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Conway recovered his hat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfully inspected the new dimple the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit of rock had dented into the top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And where do I come in?" he inquired.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Right here--to speed things up. There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one way out of the trap--the valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">here--and that's a trail about two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet to the north. One of my men is watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it every minute. Two men watch it at</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. I want a man to sneak down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail in the darkness, hide out and wait till</seg><seg type="columnLine">daylight. Then he may be able to flank</seg><seg type="columnLine">those birds with rifle-fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But Ike's death has been a lesson to us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even Bob Carroll draws the line at going</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into the valley.

I take it that you want me to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sacrifice."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not exactly that. You can use your</seg><seg type="columnLine">judgment about going. But if you help to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed things up by potting those two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hombres, why, you'll be helping yourself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll do anything for you. You can be my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head deputy if you want the job. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll be safe as far as Arizona warrants are</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Safe from Arizona warrants! This prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ise was the deciding point with Mr. Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. He would attempt the job at which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deputies had balked. After stealing two</seg><seg type="columnLine">more hasty looks down into the valley he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated himself with his back against a rock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled a cigaret, then grinned at the sheriff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why don't you send a man around to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of the cliff above the tunnel? Or to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head of the valley? From either place</seg><seg type="columnLine">it will be easy to drop lead down behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">that dump of rocks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Haven't we tried it?" growled Summers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It would take a pair of wings to get a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">up there. The head of the valley would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the easiest. A sixty-foot ladder would make</seg><seg type="columnLine">it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All I want is about a sixty-foot rope,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Mr. Conway. "I'm going to drop into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley tonight from the lower end."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">B^IB AT TWO o'clock in the morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Conway was in the valley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">■ Si Silently, in his stocking feet, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt his way along the base of the eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff toward the tunnel. Behind him a rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">of halters tied together dangled from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lowest point on the rocks. Stationed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper end of the rope were Sheriff Summers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Bob Carroll. Three sharp jerks at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope was the prearranged signal for them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull Mr. Conway up the face of the rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall in case he wished to confer with them or</seg><seg type="columnLine">had found unfeasible his plan of single-</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half an hour later Mr. Conway, pursuing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian tactics, had reached within twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet of the tunnel's mouth. There, flat on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stomach in the deep shadow of the cliff,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he lay listening. Boots had been discarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">as being out of the question; the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound might draw gun-fire. He had even</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed his belt, lest the buckle clatter on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rock as he crawled along. A knotted bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rope now held up his trousers. His Colt</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been carried inside his shirt. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">even rolled his shirt sleeves above his elbows</seg><seg type="columnLine">for fear the faint click of a wrist button</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a rock might spoil his plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, the Colt in his right hand, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">infinite caution he drew himself ahead six</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches. Again he paused to listen. A full</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute elapsed before he moved another</seg><seg type="columnLine">few inches. He was careful about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Exaggerated caution? No! Within a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, on the other side of the dump, lay an</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed and -desperate man. An occasional</seg><seg type="columnLine">body movement, a faint swish of cloth on</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirt, enabled Mr. Conway to locate the po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sition of the man on guard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The very silence of the mountain night</seg><seg type="columnLine">rendered more difficult Mr. Conway's task.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The faint, faint yapping of a distant coyote</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the occasional call of a night bird were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only sounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His fingers settled on a tiny pebble. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew back his right arm. His shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">joint creaked alarmingly. Momentarily he</seg><seg type="columnLine">held his breath. Then with a full-arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">swing he threw the stone. It clattered on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground a score of feet on the far side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dump.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A quick rustle and then silence on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the watcher betrayed alarm. Came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soft click of a rifle being cocked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Conway flung another pebble, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously arose to a crouching position.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw the guard, a vague blur in the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, less than ten feet away, his eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">faculties evidently concentrated in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two quick steps to the top of the dump,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then a rock rolled from beneath Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">170</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Conway's foot. It was no time for inde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cision; nor was there time for thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Conway acted on instinct. He leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the guard turned.

The runner fell sprawling; his rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">clattered on to the dump. Before he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">arise Mr. Conway had straddled the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his back.

"Why, you-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rest of the peroration was unneces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sarily profane, but in it Mr. Conway caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unmistakable ring of sincerity, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Which one of you's the Yucca Kid?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquired rather aimlessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something seemed to be wrong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Yucca Kid!

First a thud, then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">several seconds later, the click of hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuffs. Mr. Conway hauled up the rope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He didn't care at all about the method taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prevent the prisoners from calling out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the alarm when they regained conscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. That was up to the sheriff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After placing Speck's rifle in the patch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush where he had cached those belonging</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Kid and Carroll, Mr. Conway leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the cliff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll be back in fifteen minutes with</seg><seg type="columnLine">another one," he announced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you do to them?" was Sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mers' facetious query.

Sandy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been easily enticed, even though his partner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sweitzer, on guard, was suspicious of Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conway. But Sandy feared the Kid's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrath if he failed to answer the alleged</seg><seg type="columnLine">summons. He was lowered down the rope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sudden unconsciousness, from which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently emerged to discover himself hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuffed, his ankles strapped with a double</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn of his gun-belt, and gagged with strips</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his own shirt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the mean time Mr. Conway had start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed again toward the camp. Only two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were left--Bill Hargis, who by now un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtedly was asleep, and Pinkeye Sweit-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">zer, to whom Mr. Conway had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">introduced until late in the afternoon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Sweitzer was now alone on guard at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trail. He was regarded by Mr. Conway</seg><seg type="columnLine">as being the most dangerous man in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang. His appearance and attitude were</seg><seg type="columnLine">truculence personified, and he kept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom of his holster strapped down low on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thigh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll just leave that Sweitzer bird to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last," was Mr. Conway's decision. "He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gonna start somethin', or signs ain't worth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a nickel-plated -. He don't like me,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and I got even less use for him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Therefore Bill Hargis was awakened from</seg><seg type="columnLine">peaceful slumber and notified that his pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence was desired at a reception to be held by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sheriff Summers and Bob Carroll. Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussed with obvious sincerity, then crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the blankets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that moment Mr. Sweitzer was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed by the light of the fire. Walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">with soft tread, his rifle at his hip menacing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Conway, he approached.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bill, does this guy say that Carroll</seg><seg type="columnLine">wants you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeh.

I don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">who you are. The rest of the bunch think</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're a-fool. I don't.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bill, you hustle up to the trail. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">goin' to investigate what's goin' on. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">goin' to keep this guy covered till I'm sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that things are right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shifted the rifle, perhaps an inch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The inch was enough for Mr. Conway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Out came his Colt. He threw himself full</seg><seg type="columnLine">length sidewise. The Colt barked three</seg><seg type="columnLine">times before he struck the ground. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle roared once, and missed by three feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Sweitzer doubled up and lost all interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his contemplated investigation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No sooner had Mr. Conway fallen than he</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted around. His weapon covered Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hargis, who had started to reach for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun-belt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop, Bill! I don't want to shoot you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill stopped, and raised his hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">174</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now roll yourself in your blanket."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill rolled. Mr. Conway strapped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun-belt tight above Bill's elbows and bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ankles with thongs cut from a near-by</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle. Then he hastened to the top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tally six!" was the call that faintly</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the ears of Summers and Hopkins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten minutes later the officers climbed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trail and came into the firelight. Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conway had thrown on more fuel. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">light revealed both men as gaunt and hag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gard; this appearance was emphasized by</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirt and growths of beard, and exaggerated</seg><seg type="columnLine">in turn by the flickering blaze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Summers glanced sharply about, saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sweitzer's body and the trussed-up form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill Hargis, then advanced with out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched hand. Mr. Conway took it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Conway," said the sheriff, "I don't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell you that you saved our lives. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want to tell you this: If you ever get</seg><seg type="columnLine">extradited it will be because I am in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave.

Many have gathered about it and they are of all classes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and degrees, high and low, rich and poor, adventurers and stay-at-homes, and from all</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts of the earth. Some whose voices we used to know have taken the Long Trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">and are heard no more, but they are still memories among us, and new voices are</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard, and welcomed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We are drawn together by a common liking for the strong, clean things of out-of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors, for word from the earth's far places, for man in action instead of caged by cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumstance. The spirit of adventure lives in all men; the rest is chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But something besides a common interest holds us together. Somehow a real com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">radeship has grown up among us. Men can not thus meet and talk together without</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing into friendlier relations; many a time does one of us come to the rest for facts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and guidance; many a close personal friendship has our Camp-Fire built up between</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men who had never met; often has it proved an open sesame between strangers</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a far land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Perhaps our Camp-Fire is even a little more. Perhaps it is a bit of leaven working</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently among those of different station toward the fuller and more human understand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and sympathy that will some day bring to man the real democracy and brotherhood</seg><seg type="columnLine">he seeks. Few indeed are the agencies that bring together on a friendly footing so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">and such great extremes as here.

I met Robert Louis</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stevenson in King Kalakaua's stand at the old race-</seg><seg type="columnLine">track, and I've sat with Jack London on the lanai</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Seaside Hotel and heard him roast his critics</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the hour. I have gone back and forth across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pacific on Army transports and found old school-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mates in captain's uniform seated opposite me at</seg><seg type="columnLine">mess.

I may say that my best friend in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Honolulu was Captain Albert H.

Revolver-shooting is a hobby</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I have several trophies for revolver and shot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun work.

Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">the resemblance probably ceases.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T HAVE always had the inclination for literature</seg><seg type="columnLine">and have been actually writing for publication</seg><seg type="columnLine">since 1894, when a story of mine which appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Outing fired me with the ambition to peg away</seg><seg type="columnLine">and make good in this way, but it was later, when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the Revenue Service in Honolulu, that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to tackle the real stuff. I used to go down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the office in the old Palace and plug away on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories (sometimes all night long) and many of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">things that are appearing now are the direct result</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that patient industry. Some of it I sold, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarded the rest against the great idea of coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">East to the proper market for it and making good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I was actually on my way to New York with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea when I reached San Francisco in 1907. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I reasoned with myself something after this fashion:</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew San Francisco, after a fashion, but I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one there who would be of the slightest use or</seg><seg type="columnLine">help to me, whereas in New York I had friends and</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence. Why, then, would it not be a good idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">to "try it on the dog?" In other words, see if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make good there first. I set myself a mark.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was to sell Sunset Magazine a good story (one</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I approved of myself), illustrated by myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then I would keep on my way East.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Well, I did it. I sold them a good many other</seg><seg type="columnLine">things, cover pictures, illustrations, etc., and did</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable work for the art department of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Southern Pacific. I turned out stuff for various</seg><seg type="columnLine">publications including the Western Field, the News-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Letter and Crocker's monthly and had various in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terests with engraving firms and lithographers that</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept me pretty busy. I felt in the beginning that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was taking a sporting chance. That was my reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">for stopping there in the first place, but as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they published "On Mokapu Beach" with my illus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trations I packed my trunks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then came the appointment to the District of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Southern California and I spent the following year</seg><seg type="columnLine">there looking out for the interests of Uncle Sam,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting quail and ducks and catching rainbow</seg><seg type="columnLine">trout--altogether a busy and interesting year.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T THINK this is about all.

They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were not native to America, the horse having been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">introduced into Mexico by the Spaniards and spread</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">northward among the Indian tribes by theft and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">barter. The wild horses were originally strays,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mainly of the mustang type; that is, small, active,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">running all colors from yellow (buckskin) to black,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with many spotted pintos, black and white, bay and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">white, yellow and white, all sorts of combinations</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of color.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A FTER travel set in across the plains runaways</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from the emigrant trains joined the wild bands</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and so quite a lot of racing and saddle blood was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">introduced and some of the wild stock were very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fast, perfect, well-built animals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  If the settlement of the plains had been delayed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">another hundred years it is probable that the wild</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">horses would have outnumbered even the buffalo,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as they were more hardy, could graze a greater dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tance from water, and snow had no terrors for them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">If there is grass, two or three feet of snow doesn't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bother a horse; they will paw through it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Along about 1895 horses were so cheap that in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">western Colorado many horse outfits wouldn't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bother to look after or brand their stock, and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">herds increased with incredible rapidity, so that in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a few years it was necessary to shoot them by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thousands for the hides, in order to save the grass</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for the cattle. This shows how rapidly they increase.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There were three methods of capturing wild horses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They could be run down and roped. That is, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slower ones could. They could be walked down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">That is, a few men with pack horses could start</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">after a band and keep them on the move. At first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the horses would run clear away from their pur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">suers, but these kept steadily on the trail, and in a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">week or more the wild band would become so worn</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out from constant travel and lack of time to feed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that they could be worked into a corral, as toward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the last they became used to their pursuers and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would barely keep out of their way. Horses have a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">well-defined range and would travel in a circle,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which enabled the hunters to relay on them It was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said that a party of Indians, say a war-party, that had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been dismounted, has more than once walked down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a band of wild horses and obtained fresh mounts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">'T'HE third method of capture was to watch a des-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ert waier-hole, and when a band came and filled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up, run down and rope as many as possible, as the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wild stock was so full of water that they couldn't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">run. Horses will graze fifty miles from water if</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grass is scarce, coming in about noon every other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">day, and fill up all that their skins will hold. That's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what makes desert-raised horses such long-winded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brutes. From the day that they are born they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spend their time running for water before they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">die of thirst, and running for grass before they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">starve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As far as I know there have been no real wild</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">horses on the plains since about 1885.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I overlooked, in giving methods of capture,</seg><seg type="columnLine">creasing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That is, shooting the animal through the top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the neck just forward of the shoulder, with a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">caliber, hardened bullet, so as to make a small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean hole. The shock would knock the animal in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensible, and it would remain that way for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, long enough to run up and hog-tie it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">(~)F course this was usually done at short range,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not much over a hundred yards, although I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen it done at much greater distance. But^at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long ranges the horse was generally either missed or</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These wounds would heal quickly and the horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be all right in a few hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little more wild horse dope inclosed.

In the December</seg><seg type="columnLine">30th issue we published a picture of a cowboy</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding a steer and asked you whether or not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">artist was a man or a woman--familiar or unfamiliar</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his subject. Also we sort of half promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">a year's subscription for the best answer. As I</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle the pictures the job fell to me. That's where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rub comes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some of us in the office have a bowing acquain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance, only, with cattle, and after having read the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred-odd letters received, filled with details of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their vicious habits, especially when ridden, we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">content to let it go at that. We have never mea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sured a steer's tail, nor have we circumnavigated its</seg><seg type="columnLine">belly; we don't even know whether its horns twist in</seg><seg type="columnLine">or out. And yet we have received dozens of letters</seg><seg type="columnLine">calling attention to just those points.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Expert cowmen among you have written in saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the picture is correct in every detail; other</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowmen, just as well qualified, tell us that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture looks as much like a llama or a love-sick</seg><seg type="columnLine">gnu as it does a steer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If this particular steer could read, the only thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would be sure about himself is that he has four</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs! You all agreed on that!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thirty-six per cent, of the letters said the artist</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a woman, thirty-one per cent, thought he was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man; thirty-three per cent, did not care to express</seg><seg type="columnLine">an opinion. Sixty per cent, thought the picture was</seg><seg type="columnLine">true to life and forty per cent, did not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We received photographs proving that the picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">was correct and that it wasn't. Some of you said</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the picture was a photograph retouched. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">least six of you recognized the artist's work and</seg><seg type="columnLine">named him--Ross Santee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And with that facing us we have to choose the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best letter!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I think we may safely say that Mr. Santee knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">his subject; he is a practical cowman himself. As to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the merits of drawing--after all, a picture is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a photograph, nor should it reproduce every detail</seg><seg type="columnLine">with photographic accuracy; rather its purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be to stir the imagination. And so I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">the following letter wins the year's subscription.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If we ever run another contest we'll choose, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own peace of mind, some nice simple subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a triangle or a perfect square--nothing so com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicated as a bucking steer.--L.

Barretto.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Hot Springs, Arkansas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In spite of page 130 of Dec. 30th Adventure being</seg><seg type="columnLine">addressed to Cowboys, I think a statement from out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side that great fraternity is not out of place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The drawing is that of Ross Santee. His work by</seg><seg type="columnLine">its very dash and possible exaggeration, gives the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same feeling one has on seeing the frantic perform-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance of a cowboy and accomplice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In art this impression of life is the great tiling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The technical detail and minutiae are not what</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thoroughly thrilled audience is thinking about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And when an artist succeeds in interpreting so</seg><seg type="columnLine">vividly the cowboy and his spirit, I think the matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of detail, correct or incorrect, is unimportant, as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is in reality, compared to the anxiety as to whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cowboy stays on or not.--Frances Hordin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">VARIOUS PRACTICAL SERVICES</seg><seg type="columnLine">FREE TO ANY READER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">These services of Adventure are free to any one.

Take one</seg><seg type="columnLine">day a week for greasing, oiling, tightening up, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleaning car; this saves a lot of money. Starting</seg><seg type="columnLine">with car in perfect condition, new tires and outfit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all expenses of a car are no more than around home,</seg><seg type="columnLine">per mile.

The best time of year to visit Japan is any</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, in my opinion; but the tourist seasons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spring and Autumn offer the best traveling facili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties. From March to May and from September</seg><seg type="columnLine">to November, both inclusive, the climate is delight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful and the country everywhere is at its best.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 2.	The route and line to go are matters of indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vidual taste. If you want to make a quick voyage</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are the northern routes from Vancouver,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seattle or Tacoma---by boats of the Canadian</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pacific Ocean Services, Ltd., Nippon Yusen Kaisha</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Osaka Chosen Kaisha. If you want a longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea experience, to keep in the sunshine belt and get</seg><seg type="columnLine">all you can for your money, then sail from San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Francisco on either a Pacific Mail S. S. Cc. boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a Toyo Kisen Kaisha steamer, and see Honolulu</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the way. There's small choice in lines unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">you prefer to patronize an American-managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, or want to go on the largest boat, or want</seg><seg type="columnLine">second-class accommodations--which, by the way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are often quite desirable. Get the folders of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">companies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 3.	It is fairly easy to travel about Japan. Rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways connect all the larger towns and cities.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through trains have sleeping and dining car accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">modations, and guards and train-boys who speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough English for one to make his ordinary wants</seg><seg type="columnLine">known. The ticket-sellers in the stations gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erally speak some English. There are many inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">island steamers. Autos, street-cars and jinrikishas</seg><seg type="columnLine">are available for large-city travel, and 'rikishas are</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be procured almost everywhere in the smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">towns and country. Public roads are under process</seg><seg type="columnLine">of great improvement at present.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 4.	Yokohama, Tokyo, Nikko, Kobe, Nara, Osaka,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nagoya, Kyoto and Nagasaki are the cities you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will want to see most of. The Thomas Cook and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Raymond Whitcomb tourist agencies, also the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamship companies above referred to, publish</seg><seg type="columnLine">free booklets that will give you more extended</seg><seg type="columnLine">information on this point. There's a regular route</seg><seg type="columnLine">tourists are apt to follow, given in such booklets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all places are interesting and each city has its</seg><seg type="columnLine">own places of note. Visit some railroad general</seg><seg type="columnLine">office and get all the pamphlets you can on Japan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 5.	There are a goodly number of Americans</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing business in Japan--just how many I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know; the number has increased during the past</seg><seg type="columnLine">two years with an increase of business interests</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the two countries. Most of these manage</seg><seg type="columnLine">some branch of some United States house, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">represent in some way a large firm in America.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There are a few Americans, however, who have</seg><seg type="columnLine">established an independent business in the empire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 6.	Anything is possible. But a free-lance sales-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in Japan with no knowledge of customs or</seg><seg type="columnLine">language would be working against tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 7 and 8. The only thing I can suggest is that you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">take some periodical reviewing Oriental trade and</seg><seg type="columnLine">markets and watch for suggestions and study the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advertising to learn what houses are doing business</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Japan. There are several papers of the sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">published right where you are on the Pacific Coast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Go into some Oriental trading company and ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">about such periodicals--they'll know what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">want. Another is the Trans-Pacific magazine with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an office in San Francisco.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Most American houses trading in the Orient</seg><seg type="columnLine">prefer to send some one to buy who is trained in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own policies and who has had experience in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oriental buying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Your best way would be to connect with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">house which could use your individual abilities and</seg><seg type="columnLine">training, or gather about your buying services a</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of. say, small art-shops who want Japanese</seg><seg type="columnLine">goods directly imported and can not afford to send</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own buyer over. I met one very bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">young woman several years ago who sold American</seg><seg type="columnLine">candy in Japan, and while there bought goods at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her own risk. These she brought back and sold to</seg><seg type="columnLine">art-shops here at home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There are many ways of making a success in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buying and selling game, even with great difficul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties against one; but you wart to be very sure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself before going into a field of strange lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guage and customs. An American beach-comber</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Orient is net a pleasant thing to contemplate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, the will to do makes the way open to</seg><seg type="columnLine">success, if you will hard enough and know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are willing about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every good wish for your success if you do go over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Prospecting in Alaska</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BIG chance for the right man--after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boob has located the ore:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Question:--"A friend and myself have been think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of going to Alaska to prospect and make our</seg><seg type="columnLine">stake if possible.

I will try to give you an</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea of what the surface area of this country is like.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the west is a range of mountains running north</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and forming the boundary with part of Chile and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peru. About sixty to eighty miles east is another</seg><seg type="columnLine">range. The plateau lying in between averages about</seg><seg type="columnLine">12,000 feet above sea-level, and the tops of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains on each side run around 17,000 feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of them up to 22,000.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The eastern range-end nears the Brazilian border</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the highest peaks of the Andean chain and slopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">off into the lowlands of the upper Amazon basin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The western chain continues on north through Peru</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ecuador. These mountains and high plateaus</seg><seg type="columnLine">comprise two-fifths of the total area of the republic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> East of the eastern range and north of the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this range the country slopes off down to tropical</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, and in the extreme southeastern part it</seg><seg type="columnLine">slopes off into prairie country (chaco). Thus it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a case of finding the right altitude. The temperate</seg><seg type="columnLine">zone is from (5,500 feet above sea-level up to 12,000;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cold zone, or puna region, is from this on up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the tropical zone is from 6,500 on down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There is a portion of country lying in a triangle</seg><seg type="columnLine">roughly bounded on three sides by the Cochabamba,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Misiones, and Oriental Mountains, that is called</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "Bolivian Switzerland," a country much broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and containing some of the most fertile valleysin</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole world. Some of the towns in this region</seg><seg type="columnLine">are Cochabamba, Tarata, Potosi, San Pedro and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sucre. Roughly speaking, this country is some</seg><seg type="columnLine">100 to 200 miles southeast of La Paz, the capital.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There are other similar regions after crossing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains and proceeding down on the eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">slopes in other parts, but this is a fairly well settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">country and its resources are known.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bolivia has an estimated population of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">2,500,000, over half of whom are pure Indians of</seg><seg type="columnLine">various tribes, most of whom are tame and hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">working Quechuas. Thirteen per cent, are white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-six per cent, are mixed white-Indian; a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">Germans and other Europeans in the mining regions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with three out of a thousand black--descended from</seg><seg type="columnLine">African slaves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sheep are raised in the temperate zone with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few raised in the lower part of the puna country at</seg><seg type="columnLine">some 12,500 elevation. Goats are raised in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torrid country. Horse-raising was once a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">industry in the north, and many are now raised in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country near La Paz. Mules are imported from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Argentine by the mining companies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cost of living depends on how you live. If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">live off of native food and buy same in the public</seg><seg type="columnLine">markets you will be able to live cheaper than here;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but if you buy imported food it will cost more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The markets afford plenty of beef, both fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">and salt; mutton, fruits, potatoes, yams, etc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Write National City Bank, New York City, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">present exchange rate. I had a list but have mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Cost of clothing also varies. The native people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially the rural people, make a sort of cloth</seg><seg type="columnLine">from llama wool which is heavy and coarse and very</seg><seg type="columnLine">suitable for the highlands. For the temperate zones</seg><seg type="columnLine">they wear linen and cotton suits which cost little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bolivia was once a free-trade country, and I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">not up on the present duties either outgoing or</seg><seg type="columnLine">incoming. I know they do tax some of the products,</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially outgoing rubber and sugar. The Bureau</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, Washington,</seg><seg type="columnLine">D. C., should be able to quote such duties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The fare used to be something like $38 from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast up to La Paz. There has been a new line built</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lost Trails</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">191</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which strikes the coast at Arica, Peru, and makes a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shorter trip of it. I do not know what the fare is</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this road at present as all fares have increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly since the European war.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fare on the steamers has also increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly. It used to be $180 to Mollendo, but it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">around $360 now first-class.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You have quite a family, and this undertaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a pioneer job. The first few in there have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">benefit if the country ever does come to the front,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it will no doubt do sometime. I had a letter</seg><seg type="columnLine">three years ago from a man who had gone down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and carved out a home far in the interior and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was well satisfied. I wish I had not mislaid his</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, brother, it is as near being out of the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">world as a man can get. Don't you think you could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do your pioneering in a country that wouldn't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">so hard to get to?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is some mighty fine country in the high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lands of Central America. I know you have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand and grit to do the job with in Bolivia, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">when you talk boys and girls to me it sort of takes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heart out of me. I sure don't want to see you</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a mistake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the money you have, by going down there</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looking around, even working for some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin-mines or railroads until you are sure you see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country you are looking for, keeping your</seg><seg type="columnLine">money a secret to yourself, and then grabbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">off a boundary of land from the Government, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">could turn the trick. But make sure all the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">along. She's a country that is primitive, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">are thousands of miles that are virgin country and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that will produce anything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The native Indians are humble and tame, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few wild tribes in the yery eastern part, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be no danger to your family, and by locating</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one of the smaller towns they would not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">lonely; but carving out a home in the wilderness is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pioneer job, as I have said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> See the Encyclopedia Britannica in some library</seg><seg type="columnLine">and take a look at Bolivia for a general geographical</seg><seg type="columnLine">sketch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LOST TRAILS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Note--We offer this department of the "Camp-Fire" free of charge to those</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our readers who wish to get in touch again with old friends or acquaintances</seg><seg type="columnLine">from whom the years have separated them.
