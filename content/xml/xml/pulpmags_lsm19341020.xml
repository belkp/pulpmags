                    <ab>You have 9 million tiny tubes or filters in your Kidneys, which are at work night and day cleaning out Acids and poisonous
                        wastes and purifying your blood, which circulates thorugh your kidneys 200 times an hour. So it's no wonder that poorly
                        functioning Kidneys may be the real cause of feeling tired, run-down, nervous, Get- ting Up Nights, Rheumatic Pains and other
                        troubles.</ab>
                    <ab>Nearly everyone is likely to suffer from poorly functioning Kidneys at times because modern foods and drinks, weather changes,
                        exposure, colds, nervous strain, worry and over-work often place an extra heavy load on the Kidneys.</ab>
                    <ab>But when your Kidneys need help, don't take chances with drastic or irritating drugs. Be careful. If poorly functioning
                        Kidneys or Bladder make you suffer from Getting Up Nights, Leg Pains, Nervousness, Stiffness, Burning, Smarting, Itching
                        Acidity, Rheu- matic Pains, Lumbago, Loss of Vitality, Dark Circles under the eyes, or Dizziness, don't waste a minute. Try
                        the Doctor's pre- scription Cystex (pronounced Siss-tex). See for yourself the amaz- ing quickness with which it soothes,

                    <ab>City Health Doctor Praises Cystex</ab>
                    <ab>Doctors and druggists everywhere approve of the prescription Cystex because of its splendid ingredients and quick action. For
                        instance. Dr. W. R. George, graduate Med- ical Dept., University of Indiana, former Health Commissioner or Indianapolis, and
                        Med- ical Director for insur- ance company 10 years, recently wrote the fol- lowing letter: "There is little ques- tion but
                        what properly functioning Kidney and Bladder organs are vital to the health. Insuf- ficient Kidney excre- tions are the cause
                        of much needless suffering with aching back, weak- ness, painful joints and rheumatic pains, headaches and a general run-down,
                        ex- hausted body. This condition also in- terferes with normal rest at night by caus- ing the sufferer to rise frequently for
                        relief, and results in painful excretion, itching, smarting and burning. I am of the opinion that Cystex definitely corrects
                        frequent causes (poor kidney functions) of such con- ditions and I have actually prescribed in my own practice for many years
                        past the same ingredients contained in your formula. Cys-tex not only exerts a splendid influence in flushing poisons from the
                        urinary tract, but also has an antiseptic action and assists in freeing the blood or retained toxins. Be- lieving as I do that
                        so meritorious a prod-uct deserves the endorsement of the Medical Profession, I am happy indeed to lend my name and photograph
                        for your use in adver-tising Cystex." Signed W. R. George, M. D.</ab>

                    <ab>DULL, blotchy skin, headaches, no pep--how often these are due to constipation! In many cases the real cause of consti- pation
                        is insufficient vitamin B. If your case fails to respond to ordinary treatment, a shortage of this element is probably to
                        blame. Therefore, with adequate vitamin B, elimination will be-come easy and regular. </ab>
                    <ab>Yeast Foam Tablets furnish this factor in abundance. They are pure yeast--the richest known food source of the vitamins B and
                        G. These elements stimulate the digestive system, give tone to intestinal nerves and muscles. Then, as elimination improves,
                        energy revives, headaches go, the skin clears! Get a bottle of Yeast Foam Tablets at your druggist's today. For a free

                    <ab>Here's good news for "Naturally Skinny" folks who can't seem to add an ounce no matter what they eat. A new way has been found
                        to add flattering pounds of good, solid flesh and fill out those ugly, scrawny hollows even on men and women who have been
                        underweight for years; 5 pounds in 1 week guaran- teed--15 to 20 pounds in few weeks not uncommon.</ab>
                    <ab>This new discovery, called Kelp-a- Malt, now available in handy tab- lets offers practically all the vitally essenlial food
                        minerals in highly concentrated form. These minerals so necessary to the digestion of fats and starches--the weight-mak- ing
                        elements in your daily diet-- include a rich supply of pre- cious FOOD iodine: Kelp-a -Malt's FOOD IO-DINE nour- ishes the
                        in-ternal glands which control assimilation, the process of converting di- gested food into firm, solid flesh. 6 Kelp-a-Malt
                        tablets con-tain more FOOD IO-DINE than 480 lbs. of spinach, 1600 lbs. of beef, 1389 lbs. of lettuce.</ab>
                    <ab>Helps Correct Gas, Acidity, Constipation</ab>
                    <ab>Large numbers of people are using Kelp-a-Malt for stomach troubles, gas, acidity, intestinal disorders and constipation.
                        Kelp-a-Malt is rich in sodium which quickly converts an acid stomach to normal alkalinity. Also phosphorus and sulphur, the
                        vital elements necessary for prompt elimination of body wastes.</ab>
                    <ab>Try Kelp-a-Malt for a single week and notice the difference--how much better you sleep, how your appetite improves, how
                        ordinary stomach distress vanishes. Watch flat chest and skinny limbs fill out, and flattering extra pounds appear.
                        Kelp-a-Malt is prescribed and used by physicians. Fine for children, too. Remember the name, Kelp-a- Malt, the original kelp
                        and malt tablets. Nothing like them so do not accept imitations. Try Kelp-a- Malt. Contains no yeast, doesn't cause bloating.

                        to a higher level. And I can smoke all the Camels I want, for they don't interfere with my nerves."</ab>
