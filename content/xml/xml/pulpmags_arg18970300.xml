            <seg type="columnLine">the next train. But 011 the street he accidentally encountered an acquaintance</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he had not seen for three or four years, a shrewd looking, ferret faced little</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fellow--Ernest Mettre- The intimacy between the two men had never</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">amounted to more than mere acquaintanceship and Roberts had, at one time,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a suspicion that the Frenchman--as Mettre professed himself--was something</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of a scamp. Nevertheless, some scamps are amusing, interesting, and enjoy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the fortune therefore of being leniently tolerated by easy going men of the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mettre was one of that kind, and Roberts would have needed to be more</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">churlish than was his nature, not to have reciprocated, in some degree, the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">effusive warmth of welcome with which he was greeted. And, indeed, he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">really knew nothing against the little-man. Bven his vague suspicion was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">only second hand and not a feeling likely to find permanent lodgment in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his kindly heart.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">In the course of their conversation, Mettre soon learned that Mr, Roberts</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had closed out all his large lumber interests in the West and was on his way</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to the metropolis, presumably to find some better investment for his capital,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">I have always been disposed to keep my home life and my affairs among men</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">even know that I have relatives nearer than forty second cousins whom I</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">will." His voice took a softer tone, and there was a dreamy expression in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his eyes as he uttered that expectation of the future.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">' ' Come ! ' ' said Mettre urgently. '1 Say that you will wait over and dine</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with me. I have set my heart upon our dining together. It shall be as you</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">like. Either we will go and have a formal feast in grand style at the club,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">or we will take our chances of what Madame Mettre" will be able to give us at</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">' ' My preference certainly would be for the latter. ' '</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Is it so ? Then you are a man of heart, like me. And perhaps we shall</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not be the worse off. Madame Mettre knows well how to keep the house</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and though we live plainly it is not badly."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Roberts ended by resigning himself to the program arranged by his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">chance companion, whom lie accompanied to his home, a small but well</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">furnished cottage a little way out from the busy portion of the city. Madame</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mettre met with his approval, Without being really pretty, her features</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were pleasing and brightened up agreeably in the animation of conversation.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">In the dining room, where the light was stronger, he fancied that her eyes had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rather a hard, steely glitter and that her lips seemed thinner and straighter</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">than would be expected as indicative of perfect amiability, but that, Roberts</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">reflected philosophically, was a matter that need concern nobody but her hus-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">band.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The dinner was plain, but good and passed off quite pleasantly. When</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Roberts took his leave, it was arranged that the Mettres should call for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him the next morning at the hotel where he had elected to spend the night,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and they would go to the station together.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At the appointed hour, their carriage--with a big new trunk strapped be-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hind--stopped at the hotel door, where he waited, valise in hand, and taking</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him up went on. Roberts was unaware that the new trunk bore, upon the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">black letter " R," not an " M," as would naturally have been expected.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">When they reached the station, M. Mettre said : " Will you be so good</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as to see madame to the waiting room, while I look after the baggage? " Of</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">course Mr. Roberts did so and the husband disappeared. In a few moments</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he returned to them in haste, saying : " The train is due and I have to see</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to the weighing of that trunk. I fear it is over weight, my dear. Here is</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">madame's ticket, Mr. Roberts, and here, the ticket for a section of the parlor</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">car that I have taken that we may sit together in comfort. You will kindly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">see madame aboard if I am delayed ? Thanks ! Now I go again to that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blessed trunk." And once more he ran away.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">So it was that when the train rolled in, Mr. Roberts went aboard with the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lady, who clung very closely to him because as she said, the noise and bustle</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">all about made her nervous, and the porter who conducted him to the en-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gaged section naturally supposed them a married couple. That was also the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">impression in the mind of the parlor car conductor, who took up the section</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ticket; and in that of the train conductor, who punched together the two</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tickets tendered to him by Mr. Roberts, one a "lay over" and the other a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">" through to New York." Not until after that did M. Mettre put in his ap-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pearance. His ticket had been punched in the smoking car where he had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gone to soothe his nerves with a cigarette after his annoyance with the over</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">weight trunk.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">During the day the trio remained together, chatting, reading newspapers,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dining and supping, yet in all that time 110 one in the car would have sus-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pected from Madame Mettre's manner that she belonged to the little man, or</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from his demeanor that he was anything more than a friend. Night had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fallen when the two men went to the smoking compartment and the lady,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">comfortably nestled, in a big arm chair, seemed to fall asleep while looking</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">out upon the Hudson. The train was nearing Spuyten Duyvil, when Roberts</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and Mettre found themselves the sole occupants of the smoking room and the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">latter remarked : «</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" We will soon arrive and, as it may be chilly passing from this hot car</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to the night air, would it not be a good idea for us to take a little prudential</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dose of brandy--now?"</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Not a half bad idea," replied Roberts, reaching toward the electric</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">button to summon the porter.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"No; do not do that," interposed the Frenchman, " I will get Rosa's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">flask. She always carries a little brandy for medicinal purposes, and I am</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sure it is very much better than any we would be likely to get from the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">buffet." He went out and in a few moments returned, bringing a small</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">silver flask and a glass of water he had drawn from the cooler. As his hand</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">covered the flask, it could not have been seen by any one that the oval silver</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cup covering its lower half did not fit closely, but was held full half an inch</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">below its proper place.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mettre gave the glass of water to his companion, thus depriving him of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the use of one hand for manipulation of the flask. Then, as he himself had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">both hands free, it was quite natural that he should unscrew the cap, take</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the cup from the bottom and pour into it the brandy for his friend, uttering</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as he did so the time honored Western query: "Say when."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"When!" ejaculated Roberts, and Mettre handed him the cup. The</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">returned to its place in the rack beside the cooler. Mr. Roberts sank into a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">comfortable angle of the well padded sofa and Mettre, pocketing the flask,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">seated himself in a chair.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">talking, or trying to talk, but drowsiness seemed mastering him. His words</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">came slowly, were disconnected, presently ceased altogether and he sank back</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in torpor. The Frenchman glanced at the door to see that they were still</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">alone, then reached forward and shook his companion's shoulder, called his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">name and lifted one of his eyelids to see the dull unconscious stare that was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">like a dead man's, the conclusive evidence of perfect insensibility. Satisfied</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of his condition, Mettre with deft, skilful fingers drew from the pockets of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the corpse like sleeper his baggage checks, keys, a big well filled wallet and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">even a roll of bills. Then, with a triumphant smile, he settled himself in his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">chair and also seemed to sleep. Hardly had he so disposed himself when the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">conductor entered, passed him and shook Mr. Roberts lightly, saying " Your</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mettre, affecting to be awakened by the intrusion, sat up, asking dazedly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Hello! What's the matter? Where are we?" He spoke like one still</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Three years prior to the incidents just narrated, John Roberts, a prosper-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ous lumber dealer in Chicago, found himself compelled to go into the lime and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cement trade. He had taken for a bad debt a couple of lime kilns, fancying</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that he would be able to dispose of them readily at the low valuation he put</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">upon them, but no purchaser appeared and, as he was too good a business</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">man to let a productive plant lie idle, he kept it going and made it pay.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">But the occupation was distasteful to him. He knew nothing- about lime and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cement, and didn't want to. The semi retail character of the trade annoyed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him. Waiting for petty orders, and filling them, took too much of his time</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for all the profit there was in them, and he rued the unlucky day in which he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">first became a lime kiln man.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">That was only in the beginning, however. Eater, he learned to look back</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">while his views were undergoing that transformation, been any change in the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">business to make it any more enjoyable.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Deck Brown said to him one morning when urging him to leave his office</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and go duck shooting down on the Grand Calumet: " You're a fool to stay</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">here and do the work of a ten dollar a week clerk, just for all there is in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">your blamed lime and cement business. But for that you could go as you</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Well; I don't know that I'd hire a young man. How does the idea of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">"Ah! That's because you haven't considered it. Let's do so now.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">There isn't occupation here enough for a man. Lonesome idleness would</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">out in modern style and would not be likely to pick up pointers about your</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">business and give them away. Her presence would temper the gaiety of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">speech among the boys who might drop in to see you and improve the moral</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">atmosphere. And viewed as an office decoration, you know no young man</seg>

        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">So he did and received a peck of applications for the place. Half a dozen</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the letters he selected as more promising than the others, but among them</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he could make no choice and the thought of a personal selection, involving</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">telling several young women they "would not do," was too appalling to be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">entertained. A happy idea occurred to him. Numbering the letters consec-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">utively, he put corresponding numbers in his hat, drew out one, and in sub-</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At his first sight of " No. 3 " Roberts felicitated himself that he had not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">drawn some other number. She was a tall, slender girl, with delicate features.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Her complexion was of singular purity and her large, liquid eyes, of hazel</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tint, had the strange look of serious innocence seldom seen except in the eyes</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of young children.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Ethel Holly was the name she gave. She was an orphan, had learned</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">phonography and typewriting as a means of self support and had 110 practical</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">experience, this being the first position for which she had ventured to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">make application. Would she be satisfied with a salary of ten dollars a week ?</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was more, she feared, than her services would be worth. John Roberts</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thought to himself, it would be worth that just to see her around, but merely</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">said he would not think of paying less. And the poor girl's expressive face</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">showed such happiness in her good fortune that Roberts secretly wished he</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The next morning Ethel entered upon her simple duties which she com-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">prehended at once and discharged with conscientious fidelity. "She is a</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">One thing in her manner puzzled him a little at first. Whenever she was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">suddenly addressed, or when a stranger entered the office abruptly, a look of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">alarm would spring into her eyes, as if instinct prompted her to flight, like a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">doe in the forest at the sound of a hunter's tread ; but, in a second, the ex-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pression would vanish and she would stand firmly, collected, with heightened</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">color, her mental faculties fully alert and showing a little frown upon her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">brow, a physical expression of the reproof her courageous soul was admin-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">istering to her timid nerves. Gradually that timidity wore off, but she</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">always manifested an exquisite sensitiveness to impressions from those who</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">came near her, a psychic consciousness that sometimes astonished her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">employer when he had so far won her confidence as to be made aware of it.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">One of her earliest manifestations of that capacity, was when one Ernest</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mettre appeared with a rather tempting business project in which he desired</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to enlist a considerable capital. Mr. Roberts thought well of the scheme,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sufficiently well, at least, to take it into serious consideration and would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">probably have engaged in it but for what seemed to him afterward, when he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thought it over, a rather singular incident. M. Mettre had gone and the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lumber merchant sat cogitating, when suddenly he felt impelled to ask of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">silent girl, at her desk on the other side of the room, " What do you think</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of him?"</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Miss Holly started, turned, recovered herself and flushed, all in au in-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stant, as usual, but replied promptly : " He is not to be trusted."</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" I saw nothing. Beyond a glance, as he entered, I did not look at him.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I did not need to. His presence made me feel that he is designing and un-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Roberts thoughtfully scratched his head. He had met Mettre a year</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">or two before, among men who spoke of him as a sharp, jolly little fellow,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but their acquaintance had never been intimate. Beyond a rather shifty eye,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the Frenchman had, so far as he had seen, no visible points on which to base</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">such emphatic condemnation. Yet, something told him, Ethel's judgment</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was to be trusted and he resolved to decline the proposed enterprise, which,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">why they should not do so. In his presence, while a policeman went out to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">summon a hack, the lady took some baggage checks from her satchel and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">handed them to the friend, saying: "Will you kindly see to having our</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">hand?" she asked, turning to the sergeant, who readily procured it. She</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">folded it in the sick man's big silk handkerchief, which she took from his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">out of a window and told the driver to stop. The lady, he said, had thought</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of a drug store where they would be likely, at this hour, to find the family</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">physician and she wished to seek him there before going home. He gave an</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">horses and vehicles of various sorts, with or without drivers, for hire to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">persons who were willing to pay large prices instead of answering questions</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about their affairs. Nearly all this person's queer business was carried on at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">night. Sometimes his patrons, hard pressed by the police, had to abandon</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">valuable goods in his vehicles. The police took the goods and found out of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">what burglary they were the proceeds, but the horses and wagons went back</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">ertions, lugged Roberts and the trunks into that repellent looking shelter, he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">started off again to return the hack to its owner, at a point agreed upon, near</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the ferry on the New York side. In a little while he recrossed the river to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">As he stood on the after deck of the boat, leaning on the rail and smoking</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a cigar, he smiled in self approbation over the neatness with which he had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">" done the job." It was something of a feat, he reflected, to take possession</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of a big, strong man, in a parlor car of a wTell filled train ; pluck him from</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">As a prospective client, he managed to get past several clerks with not</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">His story was ready. He wished to get a divorce. The managing clerk</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">seemed almost to freeze with surprise and horror. Divorce business, he said,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was not at all in the liti£ of Darley, Fordyce &amp; Jadbury. They would not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">touch a divorce suit, even for a bishop, or a President. And with icy cour-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tesy he bowed his visitor to the door. Going away, M. Mettre said to him-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">self that, all things considered, he did not really want to see Mr. Darley; the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">desire had only been a whim.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">M. Mettre had several hours free to devote to interviews with real estate</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">she neared the door, all assured him he had found " Ethel." If any linger-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing doubt had remained in his mind, it would have been dispelled by the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">disappointment and dejection in her face when, an hour later, she left the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">building. When the promised woman failed to appear, the lawyer's quick</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">intelligence realized that the telephone message had been a trick perpetrated</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by the enemy, but what its object was he could not divine. The problem</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of its purpose occupied Ethel's mind as she went down to the street and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">boarded a Broadway car ; and continued to engross her thoughts while riding</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">up town, so that she saw hardly anything about her and was not even aware</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">key, the door of her boarding house. He had achieved all he dared attempt,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">was to call upon a certain lawyer, who--as he had reason to know--would be</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">dential agents to search the records in counties where the real estate lay, to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">also to see if there were any other recorded possessions than those for which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">deeds had been found. M. Mettre chafed over the delay this would involve,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">if really done, but shrewdly suspected the requirement was only a device to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">draw a large sum from him for "expenses," and made little objection.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Terms being amicably settled, the lawyer promised to expedite the search he</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The increase of the reward from one thousand to twenty five hundred</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">headed Russian Jew, who kept a small but very profitable ivery stable. His</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">acquaintance among the plunderers of society was large, and though he was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">too cautious to be tempted into participating in their enterprises, he took a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">morbid interest in their achievements and, as far as he could, shared their</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">profits--strictly in the way of business. So well informed was he that, with</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the reward was only a thousand dollars, his interest was limited to mild</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">curiosity. He tried to think who had probably been the operators, but in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">vain. None recurred to his remembrance who even remotely fitted into such</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">no more about it, until the reward leaped to a figure well worth considering,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when he was suddenly seized with a wild desire to possess it. And he had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sufficient astuteness to recognize in that speedy large increase the eloquent</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">advance more gradually. Something told him that he must have been at</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">that it had eluded him. The missing man had been "put away," and his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">extent by the many little checks a team necessarily meets with in the crowded</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">doors, found them shut in his face. Tlie.lad was chagrined. Never before</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had he failed in such an undertaking and it made him all the more angry to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">of one of his acquaintances, the local agent of the Indemnity Mutual Company,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">who had placed an insurance of fifteen thousand dollars on his life. As a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">business precaution the agent immediately notified the home office and the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">actuary, or manager, at once took active measures to protect his company</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">against what might turn out to be a swindle. From his po nt of view, it is</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not a matter involving any personal sympathy, you understand, or admitting</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of sentimental considerations. For all he knows to the contrary, John</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the company would resist payment of the claim and for that possible contest</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">did not think it worth while to explain that Mr. Burnham was an officer,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whose especial value lay in his strength and courage. The doctor rightly</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">regretted to say, could not be present, as he had a prior engagement. What</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that engagement was, may be inferred from the fact that among the ' 'per-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">a long cherished dream of Prince Heinrich of Rothenburg Schwerin; a vague</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">powerful one, and one of the emperor's most cherished provinces. The grand</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">duke himself, a courteous gray haired man of fifty, was slight and of frail</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">build, but gracious and charming and well beloved by all who knew him.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Widely traveled and a great student he had devoted most of his life to his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">aroused to look for a suitable bride. It seemed as if he could do no better</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">than to seek nearest his home, and pluck the fair flower of the house of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">contrived to have Princess Olga go as a child to the good nuns, who had</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">reddish brown hair, parted over her brows, was twisted in a loose knot on her</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">suspicion of faint accent. She had learned her English at the convent and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was a trifle proud of it. The sound of his own tongue spoken by her, was a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">revelation, and he forgot that she was a princess, and he in Rotlienburg</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Schwerin, and answered her, in English, quickly: "You were annoyed</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">During his rapid ride he noted many evident signs of panic and disturb-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">a great reputation for sanctity, and people came from all parts to consult him,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Some minutes later Norbert rode through the eastern gate, and was struck</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with the indolent, downtrodden, dirty aspect of the Egyptian sentinels. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">state of the town itself did not seem any more promising, and it was difficult</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to believe that the miserable suburbs and sordid streets could be part of so</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Jim was shortly afterward summoned from the squad room to head-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">days--011 general principles, as the captain succinctly remarked.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">These three days were the exact period of the reign of peace restored ;</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Taking advantage of the fine sunshiny afternoons of the early autumn,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Robinson used to send forth the baby in the resplendent perambulator</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for some of the tonic air. The nurse at first confined her strolls to the short</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">street within the stockade that ran before the quarters, but she soon ventured</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">out upon the trail that led down the creek to the canyon. Now' it so hap-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pened that when Jim was released, instead of going to the squad room to run</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the fire of distrustful yet exulting glances, which were his due from his com-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rades, as he should, have done, he, too, made straight for this road--and, it is</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">reasonable to suppose, in the view of a crushed spirit wanting solitude,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">purely by accident.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He came upon the woman from behind. When she heard the soft fall of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his moccasined feet, she turned ; and when she saw' who it was she paled.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Her mistress had warned her. Devil Jim, not knowing what else to do,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">possibly, ventured to smile propitiatingly. And when he performed that, for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him, very unusual thing, the girl let out a sky piercing shriek, and made for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">home with all possible haste--taking a wide course around him--abandoning</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">baby and perambulator to his mercy.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The rescuing party that set out upon her alarm was composed of young</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Robinson himself, two brother lieutenants, a scout, and an orderly or two.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The young mother would also have been with them, doubtless, but she was</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">When, after a hot run, they came within sight of the perambulator, they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">saw something which, at the very least, they did not expect to see. Robinson</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had been telling Parker and Bangs all along, in a breathless, despairing sort</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">His wife would never get over it, he knew; she would go insane, or into a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">decline, or home to her mother--oh, it was awful ! The only coherency in</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">plain, from the vvay he had been going on, that Jim was likely to have a very</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">unpleasant experience. But instead of seeing all that bad been anticipated,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">there was nothing now but a view of Devil Jim kneeling beside the perambu-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lator, ducking his ungainly head and laughing, and acting altogether as if he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were harmlessly demented. It was incredible, yet they could make nothing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">else of it.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">This development, however, if it allayed young Robinson's fears, did not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">appease his wrath. Thte abduction of the child would have been but a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">degree worse than this intimate pleasantry. That an outcast Indian should</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">be playing with his child ! It was too much. And when the fact became</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">evident that the baby was crowing in appreciative glee the last straw was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">added.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Devil Jim had his back turned when they approached. At the distance of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fifty yards or so, young Robinson stopped his companions, and went on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">noiselessly alone. As he got close he heard the Indian chanting a queer little</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">native song, accompanying it with grimaces. The baby's eyes were big;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and when his entertainer's head ducked--a part of the play which took place</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">every few seconds--his gurgles of pleasure burst forth. The father saw noth-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing to laugh at. He was upon them in a moment; and he seized the Crow</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by the shoulders and sent him sprawling.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Jim looked up from where he had been thrown. He did not seem to be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">angry, but surprised and hurt. When young Robinson, with a forbearance</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for which he congratulated himself afterward, turned him over to the orderlies</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">without chastisement, Jim seemed to take it as a matter of course that he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">should be tied at the wrists, and held out his hands. Robinson gathered the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">infant to his breast. It caused him a pang to discover that the child was not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ecstatic at its deliverance; it began to whimper, with arms outstretched</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">toward the miserable object now standing complaisant between the two</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">orderlies.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Jim got another little term for this escapade; but it was only for a fort-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">night, and when it was over and he wras out again, Mrs. Robinson was beside</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">herself to learn that he could not be detained permanently in the guardhouse</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">without some specific charge. It was a pretty note, she declared. She</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wished they had stayed in Texas.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The nurse was instructed to remain within the stockade thenceforth;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">never, upon any account, to venture outside. But even with this restriction</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">there seemed to be no way of avoiding Devil Jim. From afar he would gaze</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at the baby in the perambulator, and, successful in attracting its attention,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would perform some rediculous antics for its amusement. Indubitably the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">first white baby he had ever seen, it had for him some subtle fascination ; he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had found something more worthy his worship than the black bottle at the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">With a view to enhancing his attractiveness in infantile eyes he got to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">picking up stray articles of vivid coloring for his adornment : a bandanna</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">neckerchief came first, then a peaked baseball cap of red and white stripes,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">next a belt which was only half .a belt, the front being a sash. But the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">crowning acquisition was a small, round pocket looking glass, with a place in</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">As all these things cost money, and as Jim got very little of that, there</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was nothing left for liquor ; so he came to be out of the guardhouse nearly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">all the time. And he grew--through inward grace as well as outward care--</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to be less forbidding in aspect. With these changes Mrs. Robinson was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">beginning to think his presence in camp more endurable. But at the very</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">moment when he bid fair to become a respectable member of society he was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">guilty of his most flagrant misdeed.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The nurse, who was a more or less comely young woman, with a certainty</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the more in her own mind, was impressed with the manly bearing of a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">corporal who looked after her with very close attention when she was out</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">upon parade. Not unnaturally these two, meeting so often, in the course of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">time struck up a little flirtation ; and soon the corporal made it his business</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to await the maid at a point out of sight of quarters, where he would join her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">upon her stroll wi th the baby. Jim noticed how things were going--possibly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">surmised that the infant was not getting much attention now--and before</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">long he too, would follow, at a respectful distance.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">And thus one day, when the two lovers were so busily engrossed with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">each other that they had eyes for nothing else, Jim stole up from behind,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">doubtless with the intention of having some play with the baby. While in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the act of passing his big paw over the infant's flaxen curls he was surprised</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by its custodian, v/lio promptly delivered herself of a scream which awoke the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">echoes and caused the robust swain at her side to jump in alarm, soldier as he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">What Jim was doing with the baby's hair never transpired ; the girl,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when questioned afterward, declared that she had seen a knife gleam in the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Indian's hand, and that she was positive he intended to scalp it. But as the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">corporal could not corroborate her, much as he desired to, and as no knife was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">found upon Jim when he was searched, Captain McGuire credited the story</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to imagination. All he could do with Jim was to put him into the guard-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">house again.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Robinson believed the girl's story implicitly ; more, she believed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that Devil Jim had had designs upon the baby's life ever since it had come to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">tainly strengthened when, a few days after the latest outrage, the baby</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">became ill.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Those were troublous days. From the commandant down to the lowliest</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">--every man except Devil Jim, who was in the guardhouse. Mrs. Robinson,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her husband, Mrs. McGuire, and the surgeon, rarely left the bedside. So</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">engrossing was tlie one misfortune that discipline was relaxed, and no one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was required to do more than think of and for the baby. There was a week</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was a good thing for young Robinson that, late the same evening, there</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">came from department headquarters a telegram ordering the troop into the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">northeastern corner of the Territory ; they had stampeded ponies and cattle,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and were carrying things with a high hand ; the department commander de-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sired to suppress the band while yet there was fine weather. The orders</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were for immediate action. Therefore the troop was got into marching order</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">As it was essential that every available man be in line, Devil Jim was let</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">out at once. He was morose and dejected ; and the mood was more noticeable</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in the prevalent high spirits that had been quickly called forth by the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">promise of an exciting campaign. He was ordered to take his place in the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">detachment getting ready the pack train.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It w7as not long, however, before he succeeded in stealing away in the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">darkness. After stopping a moment in the uproarious squad room, he slunk</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">along in the deepest shadows until he was clear of quarters ; then he made</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">off at a quick run in the direction the little funeral had taken that afternoon.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was but fifty rods or so to the spot he sought ; and even in the darkness he</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He sat down beside it, puffing ; and when he had regained breath, he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">crooned the little native song young Robinson had heard beside the peram-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bulator. It was not long ; and having finished, he gravely went to the foot</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the mound and began to pluck at the long grass. Then, with great care,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he drew something from the pocket of his blouse. It was the peaked cap</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with the red and white stripes. From the same pocket came the bandanna,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and the belt that was half a sash. These he tied into a small, compact</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bundle, and, scooping out some earth with his bony fingers, placed in the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hole, covering them with the grass. For the head of the grave the resplend-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ent pocket mirror was reserved. Then he chanted another verse of the song,</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Oh, }res," answered Ned-, ' ' you can do that easily enough, I should</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">think ; and I should like you to make the attempt, if only to find out</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whether you could accomplish the ascent at some future time, if necessary.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I will go before and clear the way for you, using the axe if we meet with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">any very serious obstacles ; but I think you will be able to manage without</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">much difficulty. Ah, here, you see, is the landing at the bottom of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">flight," and Ned indicated to his companion a flat ledge about a yard square,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">close to the surface of the water.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The dingey was carefully secured, and then, stepping on to the ledge,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Ned assisted the young girl ashore.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">There could be 110 doubt as to the fact that from this ledge or landing, a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">flight of step like projections led diagonally up the face of the cliff ; and,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thickly overgrown as they were,, there could be as little doubt that, if not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">entirely artificial, nature had been largely assisted by the hand of man in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">their formation.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The flight averaged pretty evenly about a yard in width, each step being</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about six inches high; so that but for the dense growth of shrubs upon</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">them, the ascent would have been exceedingly easy. Even as things were,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Sibyl experienced far less difficulty than she had anticipated, Ned going</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">before and then pressing the shrubs aside to facilitate her passage, using his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">axe here and there to remove such growth as stood fairly in the middle of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">way.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Nor was the ascent nearly so dangerous as might have been expected, the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dense growth all along the outer edge of the stairway forming a sort of bul-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wark which rendered a fall almost impossible. So safe, indeed, and compar-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">atively easy was the ascent that it was accomplished in about twenty minutes;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when, after poiutiug out the holes in the upper platform, and fully explaining</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the structure and uses of' the sheers which he believed to have once stood</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">For a few minutes after entering everything was so dark compared with</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">ever, their ejres became accustomed to the soft twilight gloom of the place,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when Ned at once began to direct Sibyl's attention to the various articles that</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The first objects examined were the weapons, all of which were stacked in</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">about two feet in diameter, and made of a metal which, when cleaned of its</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thick coating of grime and a small portion of its surface scraped with a knife,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">turned out to be brass. On the inside two leather straps were riveted, one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for the arm to pass through and the other for the hand to grasp; but so old</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and decayed were these straps that the}7 crumbled into black dust at a touch.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">This was also the case with the wooden shafts of the spears, which pow-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dered away like touchwood. And, as for the spear heads and the blades of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the axes, they were so rust eaten that little more than a rough jagged indica-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The earthen jars, of which there were twenty four, next claimed Ned's</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">in diameter, of peculiar though not ungraceful shape, and they were singu-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">larly heavy, as Ned discovered when he seized one with the intention of</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The mouth was covered with four thicknesses of a kind of cloth, such as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Ned had never seen before; the cloth being bound round the neck of the jar</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with several turns of fine cord, which like the cloth, seemed to have been</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">treated with a waxy coating.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">If preservation was the purpose of the treatment, it had succeeded fairly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">well ; but the outer or top layer of the cloth covering the mouth of the jar</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had rotted and split here and there. The second layer, however, w7as in a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">very fair state of preservation, and the other two layers were perfect.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Ned's knife quickly severed the cord, which, however, was so rotten that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it came to pieces during the process of unwinding, and he then uncovered the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mouth of the jar and peered down into it.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The vessel was full of a coarse, dull, yellow glistening sand, a handful of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which the young fellow quickly removed and carried out into the daylight.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Ned was back in a moment, exclaiming to Sibyl in a tone of astonishment :</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">- "I am very glad to hear it," answered Sibyl. " But are you quite sure</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I know by the look and weight of it," answered Ned. "I have seen</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">too much gold dust in Australia to be deceived in such a matter. Look at it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and feel it for yourself--note the weight of a handful of it, and you will be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">satisfied that I am right. I expect the contents of all these jars are the same,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but I will open one or twTo more j ust to satisfy myself. ' '</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He did so, and found his conjecture to be correct--the three which he</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Quite a large pile of small brick like parcels next came in for a share of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">singularly heavy.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Ned opened one, and on removing the cloth wrapper disclosed to view a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">block of dull yellow virgin gold. The block was about the same shape as,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but a little larger than an ordinary brick, and stamped or molded on each</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Ned did not consider it necessary to open any more of the brick like</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">opened, each parcel would be found to contain a gold brick similar to the one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">already disclosed. He w^as therefore about to suggest a descent to the boat,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">under the impression that his inspection of the cave and its contents had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been completed, when his attention was attracted by an extra large brick like</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">it from the floor to carry it further forward into the light when, though</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tolerably heavy, the comparative ease with which he lifted it at once assured</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him that, whatever else it might be, it certainly was not gold.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">contain a number of neat parcels. The first which came to hand was at once</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">opened, and there before the eyes of the admiring pair, fresh as if just removed</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Sibyl's admiration of the pearls plunged her into a perfect trance of de-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">diamonds and other precious stones, all in their rough state just as they had</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At first the fortunate finders were not greatty impressed at the sight of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">these stones, for neither of them quite knew what they were--though they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">judged them to be valuable from the circumstance that they had been deemed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">worthy of a place in the same receptacle with the pearls--and it was only the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gleam of the diamonds which at last awakened in their minds a suspicion that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the stones were really precious.</seg>
        </ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">When at length, however, this suspicion dawned upon them, Ned posi-</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Why," he exclaimed, " we are rich ! rich beyond the power of compu-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tation. There must be at least a hundred magnificent fortunes in this cave;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and now all that we have to do is to give those ruffians the slip, when I will find</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">means to return here and recover all this treasure. Now," he went on, " I'll</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tell you what we will do. We will divide the contents of this box into two</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about equal portions, one of which we will convey from time to time 011 board</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the ship, whilst the other shall remain here ; and in this way I think we may</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">make reasonably sure of securing one half of the gems whatever happens.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The gold we must leave, I think, as too cumbersome to be dealt with under</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">our present circumstances. Now, slip those pearls into your pocket, and I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">will take as many of the diamonds and what not as I can s|ow away, after</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I have not the slightest idea who was the former rightful owner of all</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">this property," replied Ned, laughing ; "but, whoever he was, he has been</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lust and ashes long ago, and so, too, have the rovers who, I expect, brought</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">them to this out of the way place and hid them in this cave. Of one thing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">you may rest assured, and that is that we, as the finders, have a better right</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">A suitable position for the tent, which Grant proposed to put up, was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">soon found among the trees, which grew thickly in clumps on the gentle</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">slopes just beyond the sandy beach. Two cocoanut trees, growing at a con-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">venient distance apart, were selected as uprights ; and a young sapling was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">then cut dowm and lashed horizontally from trunk to trunk, at a height of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about nine feet from the ground, to serve as a ridge pole.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">articles as it was important to protect from the weather, were at once placed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">under shelter, and the interior of the tent made as comfortable as circum-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">as perhaps you may know, sir--is a rare good 'un to talk, and he managed to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">talk me, as well as the rest of the hands, quite into the idee that pirating was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">just the best thing a poor down trodden seaman could turn his hand to. But</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">after I agreed to jine them I began to think matters over a bit, and the more</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I thought about it the less I liked it; and at last I made up my mind that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I'd slip my mooring aboard the Cloud the first chance I got, So I managed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to get told off for service j'esterday in one of the boats, and watching my</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">"Well, Nicholls," said Mr. Grant, " I am heartily glad to see you, my</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">to be a wreck on the reef 011 the western side of the island. The position of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the island, as given by Ned, places us at no very great distance from land ;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but that land is inhabited by people who would not scruple for an instant to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cut our throats if they thought it would suit their purpose to do so ; it is</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">useless, therefore, for us to think of making for a nearer port than either</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Hong-Koug, or Singapore, or one of the ports of Western Australia. Our</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">island is, unfortunately for us, situated in a sea which is swept at times by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the most destructive hurricanes ; and it would be madness for us to think of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">leaving this place in anything but a craft capable of living through the very</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">worst of weather. I have not the slightest doubt of my ability to design</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">such a vessel ; but, let her be as small as we dare to make her, her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">construction will be a work of great difficulty and wrill take a long time.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">for our operations ; and, that discovered, I think we should next go to work</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to construct for ourselves such a dwelling as shall bid defiance to an assault</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by anything but civilized troops ; stock it abundantly with provisions, so that,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">if besieged, we may not have famine to contend with ; and, that done, I think</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The doctor, if left to himself, would scarcely have known what to set</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about first, and he was therefore only too glad to find that Grant was not only</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">so willing, but also so thoroughly able to grapple with the difficulty. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">said as much ; and when Nicholls was asked his opinion it turned out that he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was quite unable to advance one, but was perfectly willing to follow the lead</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">This wreck Mr. Grant was exceedingly anxious to visit, as he felt it might--</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The sight of the sharks effectually put an end to Grant's project of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">swimming off to the wreck, aud he at once began to look about him for the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">means of forming such a raft as would enable him to make the trip in safety.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">There was plenty of timber lying strewed about the beach, but he had no</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nails or tools of any description, except his axe, with which to construct the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">raft. Under these circumstances, the matter required a little thinking out ;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and whilst deliberating upon the best mode of proceeding, he sauntered along</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">divined to be human corpses, and, making his way to them, lie found he was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not mistaken. There they lay--seven of them--just as they had been washed</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">It was difficult to judge accurately how long a period had elapsed since</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">upon, especially for a man in his situation ; and he hastened to remove it by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">roughly sharpening a fragment of plank with his axe and scooping shallow</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">This shocking discovery diverted his thoughts for a short time from his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">w7as to the quick devising of expedients it was not difficult to scheme out the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">plan of such a structure as would serve his purpose.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Looking about him and collecting a quantity of such small pieces of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wreckage as had nails in them, he formed them into a heap, to which, with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the aid of some dry grass and withered leaves and a lens from his telescope,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he set fire and left it to consume. Then picking out three six inch planks of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about equal length, he sharpened their ends with his axe and laid them on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the beach, at a distance of about three feet apart, with their sharpened ends</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He next procured three pieces of plank long enough to just cross the first</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">three planks at right angles; and as soon as his bonfire had burned itself out</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he cleared the nails from among the ashes, and with them fastened his struc-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ture together. Two short pieces of plank nailed vertically in midships, with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">another piece secured on top of that, formed a rough and ready seat ; and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">two other pieces secured crosswise on each side of the outer edges of his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">viceable substitute for rowlocks. He had already been fortunate enough to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">find a couple of small oars, and he now thought he might venture to essay a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">in the center, adjusted his oars and began to try its paces. He was greatly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">surprised to find that he could propel it through the water at a very fair</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">speed, and without much effort; and, this fact ascertained, he at once headed</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">measures for swimming across to the islet in the center. Collecting a large</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bundle of rushes, he stripped, and placing his clothes and his other belongings</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">upon the flimsy raft thus formed, and stepping into the cool, refreshing</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">No adventures of any description had been met with by any of the part}-;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a circumstance which was no doubt largely due to the especial care which Dr.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Grant's story of his journey to the wreck, with the vivid description he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gave of the fertility and general productiveness of their island home, greatly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">raised the spirits of the listeners; and the sanguine way in which he spoke of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">their ability to build the little vessel, caused them already to feel as if their</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">days 011 the island were numbered.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The chief point calling for consideration was how they should dispose of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">themselves in the immediate future. Their position was this: They were then</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">located on the eastern end of the island; the lake and the islet were situated</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">almost iu the center of their domain, or say at a point about six miles distant,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as the crow flies, from the point where they then were; whilst the spot where</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the wreck lay, if measured in the same way, would be about live miles</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">further on.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Grant made it so clear to them that the islet was the most fit and proper</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spot at which to establish their headquarters that that matter might be con-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sidered as already definitely settled. But the}' would have to draw all, or</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nearly all, the materials for the proposed craft from the wreck ; and that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wreck would not only have to be broken up, but the timber, etc., would have</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to be conveyed to the islet before a permanent settlement could be established</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">there.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Had the party consisted of men only, there was 110 doubt their best plan</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would have been to remove in a body to the western end of the island, and to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">have established themselves temporarily 011 or near the beach close to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wreck whilst it was being broken up ; but it seemed to be rather a hardship</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that the women and children should have to be removed there--involving a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">somewhat lengthy and arduous journey--and to go into temporary quarters</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">only to have to return again over a great deal of the same ground after-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wards.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Grant's idea was that the ladies and children might be safely placed on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the islet, and comfortably housed there in the first place ; after which the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">three men of the party could go over to the wreck and remain there until</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">everything of value was got out of her, he undertaking to visit the islet at</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">interested ; and so it was ultimately resolved that, notwithstanding the incon-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">western side of the island.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">On the following morning this resolution was put into effect, the little</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">band taking with them nothing but just such arms as were deemed absolutely</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">essential to their safety, and the tinware, knives and forks and other small</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">table conveniences with which Ned's forethought had supplied them.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">On this occasion Grant, who of course acted as guide, struck off in a new</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">direction ; as, having made a sketch plan of the island when he was 011 the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">summit of the mountain, he believed it possible to reach the wreck by a much</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shorter route than the one he had followed. Keeping somewhat more to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">right, or in a more northerly direction than on the first occasion, he brought</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his companions out upon the banks of the stream at a distance of about two</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">miles below the lake, where the channel was somewhat wider than in any</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">other portion of its course, and where the current was particularly gentle.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Here it became necessary to construct a raft of some description for the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">transport of the party across the stream ; but, as the water was perfectly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">smooth, anything which would bear their weight and hold together during</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the passage was considered sufficient, and wdth the aid of their axes such an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">affair was knocked together in about three hours. The transit was then</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">safely accomplished ; and climbing the steep slope of the ravine through</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which the stream flowed, they found upon reaching its summit that they had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">arrived at a spot overlooking the lake, and from which they were enabled to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">obtain an excellent view both of it and the islet which occupied its center.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The ladies were especially delighted at the prospect of finding a home ill so</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lovely a spot ; whilst Henderson cordially agreed with Grant that it would be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">difficult to find a safer place and one more suitable in every respect for head-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">quarters.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Pushing 011, they arrived about three o'clock in the afternoon at the base</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the mountain ; and here, in a pretty little meadow which lay between</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">two of its projecting spurs, they determined to encamp for the night, the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">children, although they had been carried for the greater part of the day,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">being extremely tired, and the ladies scarcely less so.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A little hut of branches and palm leaves was constructed as a shelter for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the weaker members of the party during the night, the men contenting them-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">selves with the soft, luxuriant grass for their sleeping place ; and then,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whilst Nicholls set to work to build a fire, Grant and Henderson went off in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">different directions to forage for a supper.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The night passed without adventure or alarm of any description, although,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as a measure of precaution, the men had deemed it advisable that each should</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">watch for an equal portion of the time ; and 011 the following morning, after</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">an early breakfast, the march was resumed. The gap in the cliffs was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">reached about two o'clock that afternoon ; and by three the travelers found</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">themselves on the beach at its nearest point to the wreck.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The first matter to be attended to now was the erection of shelters of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">some description. Henderson undertook to cut down a couple of saplings</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which Grant pointed out as suitable for the purpose ; and whilst he was</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">engaged upon this task, the engineer, accompanied by Nicholls, went off to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the wreck, their object being to procure not only a small quantity of ship's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stores, but also one of the sails, which they intended to utilize in the con-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">On arriving alongside and making a minute inspection of the wreckage, it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was found that the raffle was so complicated that to cut away the sail from its</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">great difficulty ; so after a short consultation together, Grant and Nicholls</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">decided to cut the whole adrift from the wreck and then warp it ashore just</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as it was.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Nicholls accordingly set to work upon this task with his axe ; and whilst</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he was thus engaged Grant searched for and found the boatswain's locker,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rummaging in which he discovered a small grapnel just suited to his purpose.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">This he conve5red on deck, and, unreaving as much of the running gear as he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could get at, a good long warp was made by bending the whole together end</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to eild.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">By the time that his preparations were completed, Nicholls had got the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wreckage cut completely adrift from the hull, and the tw o men now pro-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ceeded to carefully coil down upon Grant's raft the whole of the warp ; the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the wfeckage, retained possession of the other.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Grant then pulled shoreward ; and as soon as the full length of the warp</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was paid out he dropped the grapnel overboard and then made the best of his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">way back to the wreckage, which Nicholls had already begun to drag shore-</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The progress of the wreckage shoreward was very slow, but it improved</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">in about an hour aud a half to get the spars with all attached so close to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">beach that they grounded.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was now a comparatively easy matter to cut it apart and so obtain the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sail, which was the first thing they required. The forecourse was selected,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as being of considerable dimensions ; and this, when detached from its yard,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was dragged up on the beach and spread out to dry.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">With this sail and rope procured from among the rigging which had come</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ashore attached to the spars, they were able to construct two capital tents ;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and by nightfall the party found themselves snugly housed.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The two succeeding days were devoted to the construction of a shed of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">valuable to them among the stores and the cargo of the ship. The structure</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was twenty four feet long by eighteen feet wide, and eight feet high to the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">to transfer these articles from the hulk to the shore, a raft would be neces-</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The latter transfer would involve the expenditure of an immense amount</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of labor and time., unless the wind or some other motive power could be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pressed into their service; and Grant had already learned during the course of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his professional experience that when any important work had to be performed</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">simple and easy enough matter to a shipwright, with all the usual appliances</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at his disposal, but was really an important and formidable task to a people</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">situated as these were; and therefore, when talking the matter over together,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they had, influenced by Grant's arguments, resolved to devote the time and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">labor required to construct such aids as he seemed to think would be necessary</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">To convey from where they then were round to the islet all that they</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">raft propelled by oars alone, involve a vast amount of labor and time, and it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was ultimately dee ded that it W'ould be more expeditious in the long run if a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">raft could be constructed of such a character that she could be moved in any</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">After a little thinking, Grant came to the conclusion that it would be pos-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sible to construct such a raft, and he set to work to plan it. The structure, as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">decided upon by him, consisted of two flat bottomed, straight sided pontoons,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">each twenty four feet long by six feet wide, and six feet deep, their ends</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">being curved up from the bottom until they met the deck in a sharp, chisel</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">like form.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">These pontoons were built with their fore and aft centerlines parallel, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were constructed on separate pairs of ways, the whole of the materials being</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">obtained from the wreckage already strewn along the beach, and such por-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tions of the deck planking of the wreck as could be removed without exposing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the cargo to the risk of damage by sea or rain.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The bottom planking was laid athwartships, and four of the planks at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">equal distances from each other were carried right through from pontoon to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pontoon--the pontoons being built with a space of six feet clear between</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">them--thus securely connecting the two together. They were decked all</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">over, the deck planking for a length of twelve feet in the middle portion</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">being also carried right across from one to the other.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The two pontoens were thus securely fastened together above and below,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the result being that the entire structure formed a good, substantially built</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">raft, having in its center portion a platform or deck measuring twelve feet</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fore and aft, and eighteen feet athwartships.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The craft--if one may dignify the structure with such a name--was rigged</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with one mast, situated exactly in the center, and well supported by shrouds</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on each side, and she was provided with a lateen or three cornered sail bent</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">This raft, though of such liberal dimensions, was very easy and simple to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the rafters threatened to leave their supports. He picked up a chair and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">flung it across the room. He did the same with an empty wine bottle he had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">brought with him and smiled when he heard the crash it made against the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He was trying to say something more now7, but he had not strength</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Dick Penrose lives with his grandfather on the squire's extensive farm in Lewisberry, a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">country town near Harrisburg. Dick's mother is dead, and his father went abroad some fifteen</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">years before, and has not been heard of since till one day he comes back, like one risen from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the dead, in the shape of Major Horace Penrose, who accounts for his prolonged absence and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">silence by telling a fearful story of captivity among the Moors.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The night of his return a fire breaks out in a store in the village and Dick rescues an English-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">man who had obtained lodging there for the night. This fellow, whose name is Henry Ford,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">strangely enough is recognized by the major as a valet whom he had brought from London with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him, and from whom he became separated in New York. He is taken to the farm, where he and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his master have many secret interviews.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">In course of time the squire's health fails mysteriously, and Dr. Galen, the family physician, at</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">night sets Dick to watch what goes on in the sick room. Dick conceals himself in a large</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">clothes press and is horrified to see his father enter the room, take a phial from his pocket and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pour some fluid into the squire's medicine before handing it to him. Hoping that there has</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been some mistake, the boy determines to hurry off to Dr. Galen at once for an explanation.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">But in his excitement, he leaves the doors of the wardrobe open, the major learns that he has</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been watched, and Dick is captured and dosed with chloroform before he can get off the</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The major proposes sinking Dick in the pond at once, but Ford--who has been roused--in-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sists that the boy shall not be harmed. He suggests that he be allowed to take him to the house</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of a certain Dr. Clinch, near New York, and to this the major finally consents. Ford gets his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">charge to Harrisburg and into the sleeping car of the midnight train, but just as they are about</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to start he sees something out of the window that fills him with horrified dismay. This is</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nothing more nor less than Dock Dawson, a trampish character -whom Ford has encountered</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in Harrisburg aud who knows more about the major than the latter cares to have spread abroad.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">But it is only a passing glimpse, and Ford hopes that he has been mistaken.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Still under the influence of chloroform, Dick is taken on his long journey, and when he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">comes to, finds himself in a private insane asylum. The second night he manages to escape by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the roof, and goes down the fire escape to the second floor. Then, hearing some one passing on</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">had been slightly closed--no doubt by Jason. It required but a short time to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">open it, and creeping out on the little iron platform, Dick drew the door</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tightly shut again. His situation was now somewhat improved since the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">door was closed. No-light shone on the fire escape from the corridor, and he</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He had about made up his mind to go down and take the chances when a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shadowy form rounded the angle of the house and tramped along the gravel</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Crunch ! crunch ! went the footsteps on the pebbles, and then the man</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Dick's opportunity had arrived. Quickly and noiselessly he went down</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the ladder. With a thrill of exultation he found the solid earth under his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">feet again. The last rung of the ladder rattled in his grasp. Almost uncon-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sciously he gave it a strong jerk and it tore loose from its fastenings. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was going to throw it away, but on second thought he concluded to keep it.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He struck hastily across the lawn, and the patches of shrubbery that</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">elude the watchman in such a place. Presently he reached the iron fence--</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the only barrier between himself and freedom. It was very high and very</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">strong, with sharp, jagged points, and no apparent method of scaling.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" This won't do," thought Dick. " I must find a gate."</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He moved cautiously forward and soon turned the southwest corner of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the yard. He remembered that the watchman must be somewhere in the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">vicinity, and redoubled his caution. He had now reached the main front of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the house, to judge from the numerous lighted windows. L,uckily the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shrubbery was so thick that the ray^of light were intercepted before they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could reach the place.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He crept a few yards farther and then paused. A break in the bushes</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">revealed a broad gravel walk bathed in a flood of yellow light. This ter-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">minated at a gate with two huge iron pillars and half a dozen cross bars.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The fence could readily be scaled at this point, Dick felt sure, but it would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">be a terribly risky undertaking in the vivid light.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was his only chance for freedom, however, and he concluded, before</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">making the attempt, to discover the wThereabouts of the watchman. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lingered a moment behind a clump of bushes, hoping to see the man he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wanted pass the spot on his regular round of inspection.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">All remained quiet, and he was about starting away in the direction of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">house when the angry bark of a dog was heard a short distance off. Dick</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had barely time to grasp his iron club firmly when a huge yellow hound</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sprang from the bushes. He struck the animal a heavy tap on the head, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">then sprang aside, just missing the open jaws. The brute howled with pain,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but renewed the attack valiantly. Dick managed to keep him off with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">repeated blows of his weapon. He had lost all hope of escape now, and was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">intent only on saving himself from personal injury. He heard a strange</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sound behind him, but dared not look around. Then something fell heavily</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on the gravel walk, the bushes shook violently, and a man sprang to Dick's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">side brandishing a heavy club.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Get out on the road," cried the stranger, and as the dog leaped forward</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with a fierce snarl he stretched him lifeless on the ground with a blow of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">heavy club. Dick witnessed this strange scene with the utmost amazement.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Scarcely had the hound been disabled when footsteps were heard tearing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">over the gravel. The .stranger pushed Dick into the bushes and crouched</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">low by his side. That moment the watchman reached the spot, a lantern in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">one hand, a revolver in the other. He bent partly over the dog, astonish-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ment and fear written in every line of his face.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Like a flash Dick's strange rescuer sprang up, and reaching the watchman</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at a single leap he bore him heavily to earth. The lantern rolled over on the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ground and went out. The w7atchman attempted to cry out, but his own</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">revolver was pressed against his forehead, and he speedily altered his mind.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Not a sound," whispered his assailant, " not a sound for your life."</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">A few seconds passed in silence, during which Dick could feel his heart</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Delighted at the prospect of escape Dick plunged through the shrubbery</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">moving at the lower windows. He could hear distant shouts, too. The mas-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sive gate was just before him. With a trembling hand he inserted the key in</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" They are coming," he exclaimed, and looking back along the road Dick</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Dawson watched him until he vanished in the crowd, and then he walked</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Here Dawson's reveries were interrupted by arriving at the Ninth Street</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Dawson led Dick to a remote corner, and they seated themselves at a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">"This is only a lodging house," Dawson explained, "the guests take</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">This was a welcome proposition to Dick. Dawson took him to an eating</seg>

        </ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">He invested in a three cent cigar, and then they walked slowly back to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Dick was disappointed for a little while, but he soon found pleasurable</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">occupation in watching the busy life of the Bowery from the front window.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" I wonder who that other fellow can be that Major Penrose spoke</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I've got just a nickel left," muttered Dawson ruefully, as he paid the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">A few moments later Dawson rose, stretched himself wearily, and making</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Dick was entranced by the surroundings as he trudged down the Bowery</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The street grew darker, .shabbier, and more lonely. The lad made several</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">turns, and then plunged fearlessly into the worst, the most squalid locality</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that even New York can boast of--Mulberry Street.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">On and 011 they went, until the flickering gas lamps revealed a curve</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ahead, for the street was built in the shape of a crescent. They were now in</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Dick, of course, through ignorance, did not realize the dangerous ground</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he was treading. The scene around him, with the debased phases of human</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">life, was full of absorbing interest. The sidewalks were irregular and full of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">broken ruts, the streets were narrow, aud the dingy, frowning houses that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">towered aloft on each side seemed to shut off every breath of fresh air. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">atmosphere was foul and stagnant. At this hour of the evening many</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">people were on the street, all Italians, with swarthy, villainous faces, dressed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in hideous rags.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The basements of the houses seemed given over to trade, and through the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dirty window panes could be seen foul smelling butcher stalls, stacks of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">decayed vegetables and fruit--for the Mulberry Street purveyors deal in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">second hand stock, procured probably from refuse barrels or from those who</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">make a business of begging at the area doors of up town houses. Some of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the dishes on Mulberry Street supper tables that night might have graced the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">boards of an Astor or a Vanderbilt that morning. The whole scene was one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of intense misery and squalor.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Dick's curiosity was succeeded by revulsion, and he was glad when Paddy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stopped before a gloomy four story house near the very center of the Bend.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Not a ray of light was visible, either in the basement or from the upper</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Dawson stood still for a moment, apparently uncertain what to do. A</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Suddenly from the house came a single, sharp cry--loud and piercing. It</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" That means murder," exclaimed Dawson.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He dashed up the steps and tried the handle of the door. To his surprise</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At the foot of the stairway Dawson and Dick paused. A scuffling noise</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could be plainly heard, as though somebody was bumping violently against</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">furniture.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At the far end of the hall a dim light was seen, as if coming from the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">crack of a door. The staircase was old and rotten. Dawson tore loose one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the banister posts, and with this in one hand and the revolver in the other</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he crept down the uncarpeted hallway toward the faint glimmer.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Help! Help!"</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The piteous appeal echoed through the house, and on the instant the door</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was flung open in Dawson's very face, and a man rushed into the hall.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">His back was turned toward the lighted room, and his face was invisible ;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but he saw Dawson plainly enough, and the discovery brought a cry of alarm</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to his lips that was smothered instantly when Dawson's heavy club descended</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on his head and felled him to the floor.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Lie there, you scoundrel," shouted Dawson, and then he dashed into</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the lighted room, with Dick at his heels.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Here a strange scene met their eyes. The apartment was small, with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">greasy walls and uucarpeted floor. Half a dozen chairs and two small tables</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were scattered about in various stages of dilapidation, and in the midst of this</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wreckage two men were struggling fiercely, rolling over and over aud clutch-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing each other's throats. Near by lay a huge knife, with a long, gleaming</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Dawson sprang forward, and, as the men rolled within reach, he seized</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the uppermost--a dirty Italian with horribly repulsive face, and dragged him</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by main force from his victim. Then, as the fellow rushed furiously at him,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he stunned him with a blowr from the butt of his revolver. The other man</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rose slowly to his feet, and staggered toward Dawson with outstretched</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">"You came just in time," he whispered hoarsely. " The scoundrel en-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Before Dawson could reply, a commotion was heard in the hall, and Paddy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">burst into the room, followed by two officers, who led between them the man</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whom Dawson had struck down with the club.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Dick, who had been standing near the door, started back with amazement</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as his eyes fell on the prisoner.</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Ford made no reply. His face was haggard with terror, and he was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">trembling violently, for here before him was the man whom he had believed</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then Dick, for the first time, saw plainly the features of the stranger</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" What does this mean? " he demanded of Dawson. " Who is this boy ?</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">I don't think there is any doubt. When Mr. Grimwood arrives, come up</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">This event occurred almost immediately. Wheels rattled into the yard,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He threw his wet coat and hat 011 the rack, shook hands with the doctor</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and then followed him up stairs, bearing a small Russia leather valise in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his hand. The major had returned to the sick room, looking somewhat</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">brighter from his short nap. At sight of Mr. Grimwood, the squire's eyes</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">brightened, aud he stretched out a trembling hand to greet him.</seg>
        </ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">The attorney sat down close to the bedside and carried 011 a whispered</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then he walked across to the table, opened the valise and took out paper,</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Your father is desirous of making a new will," he said curtly, addressing</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Then it only remains for me to obey his dictation," said Mr. Grimwood.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He drew the table to the bedside, arranged the writing materials, and took</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his seat, ready to begin.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At this point Dr. Galen turned suddenly pale. Catching the major's eye,</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Pompey was standing by Dick's room, the door to which was wide</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The doctor quickly entered, beckoning both to follow him. He closed the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Major Penrose," he said calmly, "I hope you will pardon the strange</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">about to be transacted in the next apartment. I have reason to believe that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Squire Penrose is going to make an important change in his will in your</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">If the doctor actually had any doubts, they were instantly banished.</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">With a sneering smile on his lips Major Penrose drew off his coat, laid it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">calmly on a cliair, and then quickly bared his right arm.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" There," he said, stretching it out, and the doctor saw plainly an oval</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Dat settles it," said Pompey. " It am de same mark."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Dr. Galen attempted to utter a feeble apology.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Don't, I beg of you," said the major pleasantly. " I don't bear any</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">malice at all. It was quite a proper proceeding on your part, and I honor you</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">all the more for your loyalty to the family. ' '</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He drew on his coat and led the way back to the sick room. This little</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">episode had occupied but a few moments. Mr. Grimwood had not yet touched</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pen or paper.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He motioned Dr. Galen and the major to seat themselves, and they took</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">chairs near the bed.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" The squire wishes that you should both be present," he said. " All is</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">readj' now," he added, bending toward the sick man.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" First of all," began the squire, in quite a firm and audible voice, " I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">want it understood that I revoke all former wills and codicils." Then, as Mr.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Grimwood began to write rapidly, he dictated, one after another, a number</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of small legacies to distant relatives and friends, and to the household servants.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">At this point Mr. Grimwood read aloud what he had written.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Yes," said the squire approvingly, " that is all right. Now, Mr. Grim-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Richard, or rather the yearly interest of that sum. Bad as he has behaved,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I feel that I should make some little provision for him. At his death let the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Grimwood wrote briskly for a few moments, and the scratching of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his pen was the only sound heard in the room. Then he stopped and turned,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">inquiringly to the sick man.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" The balance of my property, real and personal," said the squire feebly,</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Grimwood's pen began to move rapidly over the paper. Dr. Galen</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">watched every movement of the hand that was scribbling Dick Penrose's for-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tune away from him, and the major turned his gaze steadily on the floor.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I think I have everything right," said Mr. Grimwood, as he laid his pen</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">aside and applied a blotting sheet to his writing.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He held the document up where the light could fall upon it, and read it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">aloud, from beginning to end, in a hard, business like voice.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Not a word was lost on his hearers, and the squire nodded a full assent.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But the dictation had been a trying ordeal, and now he sank down among</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the bedclothes, breathing heavily.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Dr. Galen was quickly at his side, feeling his pulse and then his heart.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The major rose to his feet, ghastly pale ; the will that made him a</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"He is in no immediate danger," said the doctor reassuringly; "the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">effort has exhausted him."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He administered a few drops of a stimulating medicine, and the squire</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">soon opened his eyes, and looked around at the occupants of the room, while</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a faint flush appeared on his cheek.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" The pen," he whispered hoarsely; " hand me the pen."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He made a visible attempt to rise in bed, and the doctor, with Mr.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Grimwood's assistance, lifted him to a sitting posture and placed two pillows</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">behind^ him.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At that moment wheels rattled over the gravel road outside, and paused</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">before the house. It is doubtful if those in the room heard the sound, so</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">deeply interested were they in what was going on before them.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A small drawer was taken from the table and placed bottom up on the bed</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">On this Mr. Grimwood placed the open will.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Dr. Galen, you and I will witness the signature," he said; and then he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">handed the pen to the squire, who seized it firmly between his thumb and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">forefingers.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">For half a dozen seconds the room was so quiet that a pin could have been</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">heard to drop. Every eye was turned on the squire, as his trembling hand</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sought the blank space at the bottom of the will, and already the pen had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">marred the whiteness of the paper with the beginning of his signature when</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a confused trampling of feet was heard from the corridor, and mingled with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it the low hum of voices.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">As the sound came closer and closer, the three men standing by the bed-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">side glanced inquiringly at each other and then at the door, while the squire</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">allowed the pen to drop from his nerveless fingers.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Something strangely like a sob was heard in the hall, and for a brief</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The dull leaden sky hung close over us, and a hazy mist in the atmos-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">was completely invisible. It was a great desert of ice, and strangely enough,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when we had tramped over the monotonous surface for several hours, we</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">seemed to be floating in space, for on all sides the line of the horizon was lost,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">But Captain Fane went steadily on, and we followed him blindly through</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was a break in the ice, and without hesitation the boat was shoved into</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">beneath us and the black waters surged madly up, boiling and hissing about</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Clifton (commonly called " Clipper ") Graves, has lived with his mother in a cabin in the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Adirondack wilderness as long as he can remember. One day, while out hunting with Stilt</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Buckram, an old guide, he finds a pocketbook containing $262. The name, Almon Gaybroon, is in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it, whom Buckram declares to be one of the meanest men that ever came into the North Woods.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">But his whereabouts is unknown, and Clipper gives the pocketbook to his mother to keep until</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the owner can be found. Something in the name suggests the past to Mrs. Graves, and she is</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about to tell Clipper why his father buried himself in the wilderness where he finally</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">died, when a flood sweeps away their cabin, and the mother is drowned. In digging about the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ruins the next summer, Clipper unearths an old chest. He breaks it open and finds a package</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">containing $20,000, together with a note signed by his own father, to the effect that the money is</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a portion of $70,000 stolen from the vault in the treasury of the city of Pinkingham. The docu-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">„ment further sets forth that David Graves is not the real name of its signer, which is to be found</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in a statement in the hands of his wife. This has been swept away in the flood.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Meantime the summer season opens and one day, while out rowing 011 the lake, Clipper falls</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in with Perry Bunse, a New York boy, whose boat has been stolen from him by Fordy Gay-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">broon, who, with two of his friends, is camping out in the neighborhood. Clipper undertakes</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to get it back for him, and after a lively battle succeeds in doing this, but is eventually captured</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">himself. Fordy announces his intention of "gridironing the young thief," and treats him so</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">roughly that his own followers interfere. The matter ends by Tom Little and Life Murkison</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">going off to stay in Stilt Buckram's cabin, where Buck Ward afterwards joins them. Meantime</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Perry Bunse's father comes to the woods and Clipper learns that he was janitor of the bank at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Pinkingham at the time of the robbery. He also learns that Mr. Gaybroon was treasurer of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Pinkingham at the same period.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A little later the Gaybroons find in the woods a green box in which Clipper's mother had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">kept her combs, and from Buck's report, Clipper (who now knows that his last name is Benedict)</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">is convinced that the missing statement is in that box. During the Gaybroons' absence he goes to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">their camp, accompanied by Mr. Bunse, to whom he has told his story, and possesses himself of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the precious document. Soon afterwards they encounter the father and Son, both in a highly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">excited frame of mind, and Mr. Bunse declares that they may as well face the music there and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">to do such a thing as his father had done. If he took the money once or a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">not know the hour when he left the hotel. By this time he did not believe</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Gaybroon was very anxious to find a situation for him in Mendoro, or in</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He concluded that Fordy must feel very homesick, since all his friends, upon</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">While he was waiting for this topic to be touched upon, he saw Fordy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">driving the two horses attached to the carriage furiously down toward the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lake. He was sitting upon the front seat, but he was leaning forward, as if</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he was reaching for something, and it looked as though something was the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" I can stop the horses easily enough," replied Clifton.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">But whatever Fordy was doing to recover the reins, it was plain that it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">frightened the horses, and they increased their speed as they approached the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">water. Clifton dropped his rifle, for he needed both hands, so that he could</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">grasp the bridle of each horse.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The moment Clifton threw his rifle upon the ground, Mr. Gaybroon</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">picked it up, and tossed it out into the deep waters of the lake.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The horses were not half so furious as they had appeared to be a moment</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">before. In fact they stopped as soon as the hunter went in front of them.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Gaybroon had gone behind Clifton to pick up the rifle. As soon as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he had tossed it into the lake, he sprang upon his victim. The dangerous</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">weapon was out of the way, and there was no longer any especial danger</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in attacking the hunter, which was, plainty enough now, the program for the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The ex-treasurer threw his arms around the shoulders of Clifton, and then</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dropped upon the ground so that his foe should fall under him. Fordy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">leaped down from the carriage, and produced some small ropes, with which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he and his father secured the wrists of the prisoner. Then his ankles were</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">His captors afforded him no time for consideration, but immediately</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">which he had thrown out, drove up to the shanty. His father asked to see if</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Fordy obeyed, and when the door of the shanty was secured, he took his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">place on the front seat, and drove off. The valises and other baggage had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been stowed away in the vehicle, and it was evident that the shantyites had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">taken final leave of the camp and the wilderness.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Clifton saw that it was useless to have any words with his captors; if they</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">that he could obtain any intimation of their intentions from them.</seg>

        <ab>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" It is just ten," replied Mr. Gaybroon, after he had looked at his watch.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">" We have twenty five miles to go; but the first train we can reach goes at</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" But we must hurry up, or they may catch us," added Fordy, nervously.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Gaybroon chuckled as though he thought the departure had been</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">who sat in the adjoining chair and who was talking with her. Denslow was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">compelled to step aside at this point for an instant. A small child was walk-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing down the aisle toward him, its nurse close behind it. As Denslow waited</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for the two to pass, he overheard a woman's voice just in front of him remark</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The speaker was looking straight at Agnes. The train rounded a curve</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">realized till that moment how much he cared for Agnes Blytheway. And</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">here she was married and he was on the same train in which she was taking</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her bridal trip !</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But when the nurse aud child had passed him he kept straight on. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had started to reach the end of the train. He was not going to turn back</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">simply because he found a girl whom he had known two years before was on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her honeymoon. If she looked up he would stop and speak to her. She</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could not imagine that she had occupied a very deep place in his heart.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">She did not look up, however. Her companion had just called her attention</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to something out of the window. Denslow passed on and reached the little</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gate at the extreme end of the train. He stood here, leaning against the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">doorway, watching the pebbles among the track ballast fly up and skurry</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">along after the speeding train for a few feet, then fall down into a fresh rest-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">There was a slight breeze here. Denslow took off his traveling cap and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">let it lift the hair from his damp forehead, while he tried to dissociate the mad</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rush of the train from the swiftness with which his own thoughts seemed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">inclined to launch themselves into the future--a future, too, in which now</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">there seemed to be 110 destination, as Atlantic City was the destination of the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Of course they're bride and groom." He found himself almost uncon-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sciously echoing the words he had overheard that woman say. What</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">business was it of hers, anyway, whether those two were newly wed or not ?</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Denslow felt that he was growing unreasonably angry with the woman who</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had opened his eyes to a fact he should have been glad to learn. It might</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">have been awkward if he had gone to call at the Blytheways' just as of old.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Very likely Agnes had forgotten him. Time had moved swiftly for her, with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">all the distractions of society, while for him, in a new atmosphere and with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">new friends to make, he had had vast opportunities to think over the past and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to look forward into the future. Till this minute Denslow had not realized</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">what a very important factor in his future Agnes Blytheway had been. What</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">if this were his own wedding journey ? What if he had only stepped to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rear end of the car to see if it was not cooler, and were now going to return</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and get camp chairs so that he and she might sit there together ?</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But he found he dared not think on in this strain. It would be better,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he decided, that he should not remain in the same car. To be sure none of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the passengers could see him; there was only the pantry connected with the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">buffet behind him. Nevertheless he felt like an interloper, and replacing his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cap he turned into the side passage and began to retrace his steps. He could</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">see plainly the face of Agnes' companion now. He appeared to be a man of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about thirty five, and Denslow did not remember ever to have met him. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hurried on into his own car and tried to pass the rest of the trip in sleep--</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">an attempt at which he made a conspicuous failure.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He was among the very first to leave the train when it ran into the station</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">in her wheel chair for an airing on the board walk. Denslow offered to push</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it for her, but she said that she had a regular attendant hired by the week,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The hurly burly of the summer season at the famous coast resort had not</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The stranded whale ship was reached in due course. Mrs. Roslyn left</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">In his present state of mind Denslow did not feel an interest in anything,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">who volunteered to stay with Mrs. Roslyn, he went forward and climbed</seg>

        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">and returns to his guardian in York, who turns him adrift with only a sovereign, after informing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him that the money left for him by his father has been lost through an unfortunate speculation.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">After tramping the streets for some time and receiving several rebuffs, Jeffreys finally finds a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">position as under teacher at Galloway House, a school for little boys, conducted by Mrs. Trimble.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The boys take to him, which is sufficient to arouse the ire of Mrs. Trimble's surly first assistant,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her son Jonah, who tracks Jeffreys on one of his evening rambles and afterwards abstracts from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his pocket a letter speaking of young Forrester, the boy injured at school. Jeffreys is once more</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cast on the cold charities of the world, which throws him only one sop, in the shape of Julius, his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">guardian's dog, who has been left behind when Mr. Halgrove moves away leaving not a trace</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">behind. Jeffreys tramps his way to Grangerham, where he can find out but little about For-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rester, and then, seeking refuge for the night in a tumble down shed, overhears a plot to abduct</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Percy Rimbolt, the fourteen year old son of a wealthy family in the neighborhood. With the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">assistance of the dog, Julius, he frustrates this and restores Percy to his home.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Rimbolt takes a fancy to Jeffreys and appoints him to the post of private librarian at a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">salary of a hundred pounds a year. He gets on famously with Percy, and is treated with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">marked favor by Raby Atherton, Percy's cousin, who is staying at Wildtree during her father's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">absence in Afghanistan with his regiment. But Mrs. Rimbolt dislikes the newcomer and neg-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lects no opportunity to humiliate him. During the holidays Mrs. Scarfe and her son arrive on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a visit, and in the young man Jeffreys recognizes a schoolmate at Bolsover, one fully cognizant</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the Forrester affair. They merely exchange civilities, however, and in one way or another</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">grate harshly on each other throughout the term of Scarfe's stay. Scarfa tries to prejudice Raby</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">against Jeffreys, but she refuses to listen to tales of the librarian behind his back. When he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">goes away, however, Scarfe writes an insulting [letter to Jeffreys, giving him the opportunity to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tell the Wildtree household about the Forrester episode at Bolsover before he (Scarfe) sends</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">A S soon as he read it, Jeffreys pitched Scarfe's letter contemptuously into</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Jeffreys had nothing for it but to take the money back, much as he disliked</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Frampton told him much about Bolsover, and then began to ask him</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">his mind full}' to any one, warmed insensibly to his friend as they talked, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">reproached himself for the pride and shortsightedness which had induced him</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then they talked of the school and of young Forrester. Mr. Frampton</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">made no attempt to gloss over the wickedness of that unhappy act of passion.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">But he showed how fully he made allowance for the poor blundering offender,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and how he, at least, saw more to pity than to upbraid in it all.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He knew nothing of young Forrester's fate. He had seen in the papers</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then Jeffreys unfolded his present uncomfortable dilemma, and his inten-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">"Dear Mrs. Rimbolt:</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I reached here from home this morning, and hasten to send you a line to thank you</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for the very pleasant visit I spent in London last week. I should have written sooner, but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that I was anxious to write you on another and less pleasant subject, which I felt should</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not be done hurriedly. You will, I dare say, blame me for not having told you earlier</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">what I now feel it my duty to tell, and I trust you will understand the feelings which have</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">prevented my doing so. John Jeffreys, who is in Mr. Rimbolt's employment, is, as you</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">know, an old schoolfellow of mine. I was surprised to see him at Wildtree last Christ-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mas, and took the trouble to inquire whether he had come to you with a character or</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whether you had any knowledge of his antecedents. I imagined you had not, and sup-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">posed that as he was only engaged as a librarian inquiries as to his character were not con-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sidered necessary. But when I saw that he was being admitted as a member of your</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">household, and specially allowed to exercise an influence on Percy, I assure you I felt</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">uncomfortable, and it has been on my mind ever since to tell you what I feel you ought to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">know. Jeffreys ran away from school after committing a cruel act which, to all intents</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and purposes, was murder. His victim was a small boy whom we all loved, and who</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">never did him harm. The details of the whole affair are too horrible to dwell upon here,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but I have said enough to show you what sort of person it is who is at present intrusted</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with the care of your own son, and allowed to associate on a footing of equality with your</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">niece, Miss Atherton. I assure you it is very painful to me to write this, for I know how</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it will shock you. But I feel my conscience would not give me peace till I told you all.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">May I now ask one special favor from you ? It is well known, and you probably have</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">noticed it yourself, that Jeffreys and I naturally dislike one another. But I want you to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">believe that I write this not because I dislike Jeffreys, but because I like you all, and feel</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that Percy particularly is in peril. What I ask is that if you think it right to take any</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">action in the matter, my name may not be mentioned. It would be considered an act of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spite on my part, which it is not; and perhaps I may mention to you that I have special</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">reasons for wishing that Miss Atherton at least should not think worse of me than I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">deserve. She would certainly misunderstand it if my name were mentioned. I feel I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">have only done my duty, and I assure you it will be a great relief to me to know that you</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">are rid of one who cannot fail to exercise a fatal influence on the pure and honest mind of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">my friend Percy.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">to take a single step to reinstate himself in a house from which he had been</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">so ignominiously expelled. No, not even when that house held within its</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">On the contrary, he would hide himself from them, even though they</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At first, as I said, he tried to hold up his head. He inquired in one or</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">two quarters for work. But the question always came up:</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">' ' What is your character ? ' '</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">' ' Why did you leave your last place ? ' '</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Once indeed he did get a temporary job at a warehouse--as a porter--and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for a week, a happy week, used his broad back and brawny arms in carrying</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">heavy loads and lifting weights. Hope sprang again within him as he labored.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He might yet, by beginning at the lowest step, rise above his evil name and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">conquer it.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Alas ! One day a shilling was lost from the warehouseman's desk.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Jeffreys had been seen near the place and was suspected. He resented the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">charge scornfully at first, then savagely, and in an outbreak of rage struck</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his accuser. He was impeached before the head of the firm, and it was dis-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">covered that he had come without a character. That was,enough. He was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bundled out of the place at five minutes' notice, with a threat of a policeman</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">if he made it six. And even when a week later the shilling was found in the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">warehouseman's blotting paper, no one doubted that the cashiered rogue was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as cunning as he was nefarious.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">After that he had given up what seemed the farce of holding up his head.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">What was the use, he said, when, as sure as night follows day, that bad name</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of his dogged him wherever he went ?</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">So Jeffreys began to go down. In after years he spoke very little of those</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">six months in London, and when he did, it was about people he had met, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">1140</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">not about himself. What he did, where he lodged, how he lived, these were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">matters that he never mentioned, and never liked to be asked about.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I am quite sure myself that the reason of this silence was not shame. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was not one of those fellows who revenge themselves on fate by deliberately</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">going to the bad. At his worst, he had no taste for vice nor any affinity for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it. He may have sunk low, not because he himself was low, but because in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his miserable feud with all the world he scorned not to share the lot of others</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as miserable as himself.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">His money--he had a few pounds when he left Clarges Street--soon failed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him. He made no great efforts to keep it, and was relieved to see the end</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of it. His companions in misery soon helped him away with it, and he let</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">them.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But when it was gone the old necessity for work came back. By day he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hardly ever ventured out of his court for fear of being seen by some one who</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would attempt to rescue him from his present condition. At night he wan-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dered restlessly about in the narrow streets picking up an early morning job</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at Covent Garden Market or in the omnibus stables.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He moved his lodgings incessantly, one week inhabiting a garret in West-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">minster, another sharing a common room in Whitechapel, another doing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">without lodgings altogether. He spoke little or not at all to his fellow mis-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">erables, not because he despised them, but because they fought shy of him.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">They disliked his superior ways, and his ill concealed disgust of their habits</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and vices. They could have forgiven him for being a criminal in hiding; that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they were used to. But a man who spoke like a gentleman, who took no</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pleasure in their low sports, and sat dumb while they talked loud and broad,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">seemed to them an interloper and an intruder.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Once--it was about the beginning of August--in a lodging house across</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the river, he met a young fellow to whom for a day or two he felt drawn.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">His story was a sad one. His father had beefn a gentleman, and the boy had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been brought up in luxury and virtue. While at school his father had died,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and before he had left school his mother had been married again to a brute,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">who not only broke her heart, but, after setting himself to corrupt his step-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">son, had at last turned him adrift without a penny in the world. The lad,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with no strong principle to uphold him, had sunk deep in vice. Yet there</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lurked about him occasional flashes of something better.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" After all," he would say to Jeffreys, as the two lay at night almost 011</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bare boards, "what's the odds? I maybe miserable one day, but I'm jolly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the next. Now you seem to prefer to be uniformly miserable. ' '</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Hardly a case of preference," said Jeffreys ; " but I'm not sure that it</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He had been listening for some time, crouching in a dark corner of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">As they drew near to the bridge they stopped once more, and Jeffreys, peer-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Across the bridge he turned and followed the high banks of the canal.</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Jeffreys followed with difficulty, and when at last he stood on the towing</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Jeffreys turned to the right, and, anxiously scanning both the bank and the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A few yards down he came upon a heap of stones piled up across the path.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Any one clambering across this must have made noise enough to be heard</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">twenty yards away, and, as far as he could judge in the darkness, no one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had stepped upon it. He then turned back hurriedly and retraced his steps.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The sullen water, hissing still under the heavy rain, gave no sign as he</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The high bank on its left, beyond the palings, became inaccessible from</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">For five minutes he ran on, straining his eyes and ears, when suddenly he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stumbled. It was a hat upon the path.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">In a moment Jeffreys dived into the cold water. As he came to the sur-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">face and looked round there was nothing but the spreading circles of his own</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">plunge to be seen, but a moment afterwards, close to the bank, he had a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">glimpse of something black rising for an instant and then disappearing.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Three strokes brought him to the spot just as the object rose again.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">To seize it and strike out for the bank was the work of a moment. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">man, for it was he, was alive, and as Jeffreys slowly drew him from the water</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he opened his eyes and made a faint resistance.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Let me go ! " he said, with an oatli; " let me go ! "</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">But his head fell heavily on his rescuer's shoulder while he spoke, and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">forth three small boxes which I knew contained bonds, stocks and other</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">securities of great value. He hurriedly examined the contents of the first</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">box and found them correct, but his excitement increased as he turned to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">second. This box contained a greater number of papers and it took several</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">minutes to examine all of them. The detective stood at the banker's side, an</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Bond was quite pale and nervous by this time and seemed to forget the</seg>
