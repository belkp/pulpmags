If so, you'll want to read how my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eyes were opened for me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When broadcasting first bccame the rage,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">several years ago, I first began my dabbling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with the new art of Radio. I was "nuts"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about the subject, like many thousands of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other fellows all over the country. And no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wonder! There's a fascination--something</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that grabs hold of a fellow--about twirling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a little knob and suddenly listening to a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">voice speaking a thousand miles away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Twirling it a little more and listening to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mysterious dots and dashes of steamers far</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at sea. Even today I get a thrill from this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strange force. In those days, many times I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stayed up almost the whole night trying for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">DX. Many times I missed supper because</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I couldn't be dragged away from the latest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">circuit I was trying out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I never seemed to get very far with it,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">though. I used to read the Radio magazines</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and occasionally a Radio book, but I never</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">understood the subject very clearly, and lots</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of things I didn't see through at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So, up to a year ago, I was just a dabbler</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--I thought Radio was a plaything. I never</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">realized what an enormous fast-growing in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dustry Radio had come to be--employing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thousands and thousands, of trained men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	usually stayed home in the evenings after</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, because I didn't make enough money</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go out very much. And generally during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evening I'd tinker a little with Radio--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a set of my own or some friend's. I even</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a little spare change this way, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped a lot, but I didn't know enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go very far with such work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as for the idea chat a splendid Radio,</seg><seg type="columnLine">job might be mine, if I made a little effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prepare for it--such an idea never entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head. When a friend suggested it to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">one year ago, I laughed at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're kidding me," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not," he replied. "Take a look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this ad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pointed to a page ad in a magazine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an advertisement I'd seen many times but</seg><seg type="columnLine">just passed up without thinking, never</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreaming it applied to me. This time I read</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ad carefully. It told of many big oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunities for trained men to succeed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great new Radio field. With the advertise-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment was a coupon offering a big free book</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of information. I sent the coupon in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in a few days received a handsome 64-</seg><seg type="columnLine">page book, printed in two colors, telling all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the opportunities in the Radio field</seg><seg type="columnLine">and how a man can prepare quickly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily at home to take advantage of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunities. Well, it was a revelation to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I read the book carefully, and when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished it I made my decision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What's happened in the twelve months</seg><seg type="columnLine">since that day, as I've already told you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems almost like a dream to me nowr. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten of those twelve months, I've had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Radio business of my own.

Once ill a while a philosopher breaks loose and begins to</seg><seg type="columnLine">P question life in general and to ask ''Why is life?" Of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no satisfactory answer has ever come forth, and probably none</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever will be found.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   But to the thinking student, the thought must occur that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> anything alive, whether it be human being, animal or plant, is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> exceedingly out of keeping with the rest of the universe. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> max be said definitely that life, as we know it, occurs only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> in extremely isolated instances, and such sort of life amounts</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to so little that it is entirely negligible in relation to the rest of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the universe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Take our own planet, for instance. If you investigate the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> subject, you will find that all life, in proportion to the planet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> itself, amounts to practically nothing. The overwhelming ma-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> jority of the planet is inert matter--atmosphere, oceans, contin-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ents and the material that composes them. It is the same</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> throughout nature. Take the parent body, for example, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> sun, which is responsible for all life. We know definitely that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> it is impossible for life, as we know it, to exist on the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neither animals nor plants could live on the sun, even for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> merest fraction of a second.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Practically all of our planets tell the same story. Jupiter, by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> far the largest of all the planets--as large, in fact, as all the rest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of the planets combined--is still in a plastic form. It has not,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> as yet, cooled down. We know for a certainty that life, such as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> we encounter on this planet, cannot exist on Jupiter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   On the other hand, we also know, for a certainty, that life</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> will not. always be existent upon our own planet. Indeed, for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">billions of years, before life appeared on this planet, it was en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely barren of plant and animal life, and if we take a lesson</seg><seg type="columnLine">from our own moon, from Mars, and from other celestial bodies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we may predict, with equal certainty, that a time will come on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, when life will again be non-existent,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Indeed, scientists tell us that this recurring change is no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">a novelty on this planet. This idea of a sort of cycle, is sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported by the famous English scientist, Soddy. Due. to radium</seg><seg type="columnLine">action, the earth 'r.ill C0lttimia% -get- hotter, until finally, jt-wflf</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically burn up. Then will come another period of cooling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a crust will again form upon the earth, It wnich time it</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be possible for life to inhabit the thin crust once more, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same as it does now. How long these cycles last, no one knows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In between, there are the ice ages, 'as well as the other cycles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">well known to geologists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one seems to be certain that life appears 011 this planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">after every general destruction. As a matter of fact, life itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a great puzzle to pure science, and really unaccountable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Human beings, in their arrogance and conceit, are prone to</seg><seg type="columnLine">point out that it is the human mind which controls the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But this is plain foolishness and means nothing. It is simply hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man vain-gloriousness to assume so. Human life, and all other</seg><seg type="columnLine">life as well, is of no necessity to nature in general. Millions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of celestial bodies get along very nicely without life, just the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same as our sun and other heavenly bodies do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It pleases us and pleases our vanity to think how important we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are to this world, yet, when we consider the problem soberly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we must admit that the human being is, and probably always</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be, subservient to all nature's forces, whether they be</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthquakes, tornadoes, tidal waves, stellar cataclysms, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">what not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Sun, 92,000,000 miles away, gives us what we are pleased</seg><seg type="columnLine">to call life. Without it, we should perish, as many other races</seg><seg type="columnLine">have doubtless perished countless times, in the history of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">universe. No matter what we do on earth, and no matter how</seg><seg type="columnLine">grandiose our handiwork, nothing will remain after the usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">geological cataclysm. It is probably certain that civilizations</seg><seg type="columnLine">much higher than ours were present upon this globe, many</seg><seg type="columnLine">times in the history of the earth.

There was a crash, instantan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eously loud, and fading almost instantly to a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant, muffled rumble, and ceasing suddenly. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a heavy thud and a pounding on the floor. Sheila gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little scream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There in front of them was a rapidly moving object;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it bounced up and down off the floor to a height of</seg><seg type="columnLine">three feet about once a second. It did not have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmonic motion of a bouncing body, however; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped abruptly up in the air and shot downward at</seg><seg type="columnLine">high speed, hit the floor, stopped a moment and shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">back upward. Then it stopped suddenly and hung in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air. It was about the size of a large watermelon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked for all the world like human skin; smooth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniform, unbroken all around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two stared at it amazed. Heagey walked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and touched it with the tip of a finger.

When it stopped growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly, it was the size of a big barrel, with rounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">ends. There was a bulging ridge around the middle, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">each side of which was a dark-brown strap of some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing like leather. The rest of it was just naked skin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Sheila and Heagey stood rooted to the spot, staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">at it and at each other. What was the thing? Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">had it come from?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Thing began thumping up and down off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">-flaor again, with great, thudding shocks. After a while</seg><seg type="columnLine">it desisted and lay sfai. It was a most uncouth, hideous</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking thing: a great lump of naked flesh with two</seg><seg type="columnLine">straps around it. It looked for all the world like some</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge tumor in a medical museum, or like some mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strosity of birth. Could it be alive?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both of them approached it cautiously. Heagey</seg><seg type="columnLine">pricked it with a pin. The skin was tough and he jabbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard. A drop of blood appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then there was a terrible commotion. The object</seg><seg type="columnLine">decreased in size to a small sphere like a baseball. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, there were several baseball-sized lumps of flesh</seg><seg type="columnLine">all around; just naked flesh. They moved rapidly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of them were between him and Sheila. Two or</seg><seg type="columnLine">three were on the far side of her. He counted ten of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them altogether. Five of them closed swiftly around</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. Then she was gone!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Her scream, cut suddenly short, still rang in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears. And she was gone! Suddenly vanished from in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of him! He groped about, feeling for her in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty air, but there was nothing anywhere. There lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">the watermelon-like lump of flesh that he had first seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was on the floor and lay quite still. And she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone! He held his head distractedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door opened and Professor Mathers, Sheila's</seg><seg type="columnLine">father, came in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's going on in here?" he demanded, blinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Heagey stared blankly, trying to think.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "This thumping and screaming?" the professor con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think I begin to understand," Heagey began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Think you understand!" the professor shouted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What have you done to my daughter? She doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream for nothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He caught sight of the ovoid lump of flesh. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned pale and stopped as if frozen. Some terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought crossed his mind, connecting it with his daugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter; had some nefarious experiment turned her into</seg><seg type="columnLine">that thing ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's that?" he snapped savagely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Something's got to be done," Heagey said, chiefly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. "We've got to bring her back here. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid to manipulate the thing too many times; the Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">only knows what else it may dip up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor glared,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You sound like a first-rate maniac-depressive crazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">man----"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait till I shut that thing up," Heagey said, getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hold on himself; "and I'll explain all I know about</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, I was getting ready to try to rotate a dog out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, and so I have a new, strong dog-cage here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He set the dog-cage down beside the lump of flesh;</seg><seg type="columnLine">very gently, very slowly, he pushed it in. His touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">recoiled at the warm, soft feel of it; but he got it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cage and locked the door. Then he set out a chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the professor, but his hand shook, for his mind was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Sheila.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat down facing the professor, his back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cage. Suddenly the professor's face fell, and his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared ahead with a look of utter blankness. Heagey</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled around and looked at his "specimen." It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the cage!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There hadn't been a sound. His eyes had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">off it for ten seconds. The cage was still locked. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">it lay, three feet away from the cage, only it wasij'Hhe</seg><seg type="columnLine">same. There were two pieces of it now, longTcylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drical, rounded at the ends. Like a couple of legs with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out knees or feet, Heagey got up and unlocked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cage, noting that it required fifteen seconds. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">around inside the cage with his hands, but found noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After all," he sighed, "it is very simple."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE professor stared at him, now thoroughly con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced that he was crazy. Heagey explained about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sixteen equations and how readily they interlocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the electromagnetic integrals, and of how the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple application of any I orm of electromagnetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy would rotate four coordinates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wanted her to see the preliminary experiment. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">used but little power on a small field. Just opened a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little trap-door into space, so to speak. There is only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one explanation for what has happened here, I rotated</seg><seg type="columnLine">a portion of a fourth dimension, and left a hole in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hyperspace for an instant. Just as if you rotate up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">portion of this floor, there will be a hole left. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance would have it, just at that moment some inhabi -</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant of hyperspace came along and stumbled into it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I swung back on him and caught him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here he is, stuck.

If they draw a circle around my finger and try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to imprison it, I can withdraw it and stick it through</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere else, and they cannot understand how it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">done-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what about Sheila? Where is she?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heagey's face dropped. He had been full of interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and exultation in his problem. The reminder of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an icy shock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is only one possible conclusion," he went on in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dead voice. "The struggles of the fourth-dimensional</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature swept her out into hyperspace."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor sprang up and walked rapidly out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room. There was something determined in his stride.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He slammed the door. Heagey sat down and thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Somehow he must rescue Sheila.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How could it be done? Should he try the rotation</seg><seg type="columnLine">again? He had all the figures and could repeat it ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curately. But, that would not be at, all certain to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">her back. The captured fourth-dimensional creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">might get away. Heagey didn't want to lose him. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only that he wanted to study him, but somehow he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he must hang on to the only link with that world</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Sheila was now lost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thought of its getting away worried him. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">could he make sure that it would not escape? He</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasoned back to the plane section of a three-dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional object. Enclosing it in a circle would do no</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, if tied tightly with a circle of rope, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be kept from moving up and down. Analogically,'</seg><seg type="columnLine">jif he could get this thing into some sort of a tight bag,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might feel free to flip his trap-door once more. Ah!</seg><seg type="columnLine">then came the brilliant idea!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could sally out into hyperspace and look for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sheila!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He got the lump of flesh fastened up tight in a canvas</seg><seg type="columnLine">sack and lashed the other end of the stout rope with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he tied it, around a concrete pillar. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door opened and two policemen walked in, followed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the professor. He was urging them on. "There he</seg><seg type="columnLine">is! Grab him !" he seemed to say in attitude and gesture,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though not in words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A pang of alarm shot through Heagey. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed right here to rescue Sheila. What would become</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her if they locked him up? His mind as usual worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly and logically, in contradistinction to the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor's. who seemed to have been thrown into an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasoning rage by his daughter's disappearance. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang to his switchboard and shouted:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something in his determined attitude alarmed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">policemen; his hand on the ominous-looking apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">might mean something. They stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's this? What do you want?" Heagey de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor's torrents broke loose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He murdered my daughter. Made away with her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I've got a warrant for his arrest.' Nonsensical twaddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the fourth dimension. Prosecute him to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">limit; that's what I'll do. Been hanging around her</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much. He's crazy. Throw him in jail. Make him</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring her back!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heagey laughed a desperate laugh, which made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other three more certain that he was a dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">maniac.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Like throwing debtors into jail," Heagey derided</seg><seg type="columnLine">acidly. "Fat chance of paying the debt then! Move</seg><seg type="columnLine">another step and I'll throw the three of you into un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known hyperspace."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were all afraid, of they knew not what. Heagey</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlined to them that he wanted to go out into hyper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">space and search for Sheila. But he would tie himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a rope fastened at this end. And he wanted some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one here at this end, who was friendly to him, to man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age things. He telephoned out for a rope and for two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his students. The policemen watched, too puzzled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what to do. The professor acquiesced, more from</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear, like a man at the point of a gun, than because be</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the reason of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rope was delivered and the two students, Adkins</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Beemer, arrived. They helped him fix a firm sling</seg><seg type="columnLine">around his shoulders, waist, and thighs. The loose rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">was coiled up on the floor, several hundred feet of it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the other end tied to a concrete pillar. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was some amazed staring by the students at the writhing</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in the canvas sack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll tell you about that later," Heagey said. "All the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointers and dials are set. All you need to do is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw this switch and jerk It back at -AtfkmsTyoiT"</seg><seg type="columnLine">do that; and Beemer, you watch the rope. When I</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal by jerking it six times, Adkins, you throw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch again the same way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was all. Without another word Adkins threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the switch. There was the same crash, instantaneously</seg><seg type="columnLine">muffled and almost suddenly fading away as at a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance. There was a momentary sensation of agitation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though nothing really moved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HEAGEV was gone. The loose end of the rope that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had tied him lay on the floor. It was certainly a</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathless thing. The professor stared with a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacant expression on his face, as though the solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground had suddenly dropped from beneath his feet. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawned upon him that perhaps Sheila had really dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared that way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beemer picked up the end of the rope. It was not an</seg><seg type="columnLine">end; it merely looked that way. There was a strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">tension on it; in fact it soon began to slip through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, and coil after coil was drawn off the pile on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, and simply vanished. For a while it stopped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then went on unwinding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The policemen gazed blankly. They were unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand what had happened. The man they were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrest had suddenly melted from sight. They mumblgd</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonished monosyllables to each other. But, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not as astonished as was Professor Mathers. ' They</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not grasp the enormity of what was going on. as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did. It upset his whole mental universe. He sat a while</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then paced nervously up and down the vast room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">972</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He came and looked at the rope. Then he looked at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the canvas sack. The sack lay loose as though the con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tents had escaped. He felt of it and found that it con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tained three soft, baseball-sized objects. He jumped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">back and shrank away from it. The time seemed in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">terminable. He waited and waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Besides an occasional mumble between the policemen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or a short exclamation from Adkins or Beemer, there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was no conversation. Beemer watched the rope closely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was a tense nervous strain created largely by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">professor's distracted movements. Then, after what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seemed hours, though in reality less than one hour, there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were six short tugs on the rope. Adkins threw his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">switch, and out of the crash and tremor Heagey tumbled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out on the floor, all tangled up in coils of rope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He was breathless, haggard, wild-eyed. He lay for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a moment on the floor, panting. Then he sprang up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and gazed fiercely, wildly about. He seemed sud-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">denly to perceive where he was. An expression of re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lief came over his face; he sighed deeply and sank</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down to a sitting position. He looked exhausted; his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clothes were disarranged and ripped in some places,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and were covered with dust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The five people looked at him in silent amazement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He looked from one to the other of .them; it was a long</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">time before he spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Good to be back here. I can hardly believe I'm</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">really back. Never again for me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What about Sheila? Where is she?" the professor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Heagey recoiled as though from some shock. He sank</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">^gailM«±a-4&gt;rofound depression. At first he"had seemed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a little happy tcget Tjack. Apparently Sheila had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">forcibly driven out of his mind for the time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Let me tell you about it," he began slowly. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seemed not to know just how to proceed. "That is, if</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I can. I don't even know how to tell it. I know what it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">must feel like to go insane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "1 heard the switch go down as I gave Adkins the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">signal.

Until I looked around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I was sitting on something that looked like rock or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cement. Not far from me was that barrel-like lump of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flesh with the two straps around it, just exactly as I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had seen it in the laboratory. And- then a row of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shapes reaching into the dim, blue distance. The nearer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ones seemed to be of concrete or cement. You've heard</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me jeer at the crazy, cubistic and futuristic designs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on book wrappers and wall-paper. Well, those are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pleasant and harmonious compared with the dizzy,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">jagged angles, the irregular, zig-zag shapes with peaks</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and slants, and everything out of sense and reason ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cept perspective. Perspective was still correct. Just</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a long, straight row fading into the distance. What in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the world it could be, I hadn't the faintest idea. How-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ever, I gradually reasoned it out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Naturally, since I am a three-dimensional organism,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I can only perceive three dimensions. Even out in hvper-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">space I can only see three dimensions. What I saw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">must therefore be the spatial cross-section of some sort</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of buildings. I couldn't see the entire buildings, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">merely the cross-section cut by the particular set of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">coordinates in which I was. Now it occurs to me, that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">since that barrel-like thing looked exactly the same to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me out there as it did in the room here, I must have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been in a 'space' or set of coordinates parallel to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ones we are in now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"TMAGINE a two-dimensional being, whose life bad</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A been confined to a sheet of paper and who could</seg><seg type="columnLine">only perceive in two dimensions, suddenly turned loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a room. He could only see one plane at a time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everything he saw would be cross-sections of things</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we know them. Wouldn't he go crazy? I nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I first started out to walk along beside the row of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock-like shapes. Suddenly near me there appeared two</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres of flesh, just like this one we have here. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly increased in size, coalesced into a barrel-shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing with a metal-web belt around the middle, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then dwindled quickly; there were three or four smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">gobs of stuff and then ten or a dozen little ones ; finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">an irregular, blotchy, melon-like thing which quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared. In fifteen seconds it had all materialized</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was beginning to understand the stuff now. Merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">some inhabitant or creature of hyperspace going by.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he passed through my particular spatial plane, I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">successive cross-sections of him. Just as though my</seg><seg type="columnLine">body were passing through a plane, say feet first: first</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would be two irregular circles; then a larger oval,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trunk, with two circles, the arms, at the sides and</seg><seg type="columnLine">separate from it; and so on until the top of the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished as a small spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I followed down the line of buildings, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">around.

Some seemed to be metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">or concrete, some human flesh, naked or clothed. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes my mind became accustomed to interpret-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing this passage of fourth-dimensional things through</seg><seg type="columnLine">my 'plane' and I studied them with interest. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped and fell, down. Down I whizzed for a while,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and everything about me disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I found myself rolling; and sitting up, I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">around again. There was nothing. I still seemed.to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be on cement or stone; and in all directions it stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">away endlessly into the distance. It was the most dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerting thing I had ever seen in my life. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a speck in a universe of cement pavement. I began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get panicky, but controlled myself and started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk, feeling the reassuring pull of the rope behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I walked nervously and saw nothing anywhere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evidently I had slipped off my former 'plane' and got'</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten into a new one. The rope tightened suddenly; per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps I had reached the end of it. It jerked me back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards and I swung dizzily, my feet hanging loose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I swung among millions of small spherical bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">disposed irregularly in all directions about me, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">below.

For a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I climbed over some huge metal framework; I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran into moving things that grew larger and disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared; I struggled through a jungle of some soft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">green, vegetable stuff.

I yelled her name until I was hoarse and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head throbbed, but nothing happened. I grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">panicky and decided I wanted to go back. I pulled on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rope and dragged myself toward the direction from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it came; sometimes I slid rapidly toward it; at</seg><seg type="columnLine">others I could feel myself dragging my entire weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my arms. Then I could go no further, pull as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might. It seemed like trying to reach an inch higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">than you really can; I couldn't quite stretch that far.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So I gave it six short tugs. Very quietly I tumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">out here. I haven't seen Sheila."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor was calm. His face was set hard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Either you're telling the truth or you're insane as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">loon," he said, and his voice was puzzled and sincere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Perhaps I'm crazy, too.

See!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE professor was a better man than his blustering</seg><seg type="columnLine">actions might lead one to think.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I'm worried," he said shortly. "Can I help</seg><seg type="columnLine">you any?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heagey never changed expression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps you can.

He jumped up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ran his hands through his hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God! Think of it!" he gasped. "Sheila out there</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone! In that mad placc! Not even a rope!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paced rapidly around the room. Then he seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper and pencil and began to draw. He drew circles</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ellipsoids of different sizes and laid the drawings in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a row. The professor came in an hour later and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">him at it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you ever expect to find her that way?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">growled peevishly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shut up!" Heagey snapped, his nerves tautened into</seg><seg type="columnLine">disrespect. He swept up the papers with his hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crumpled them into the waste-basket. "No use. Can't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">study four-dimensional stuff on a two-dimensional</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane. Say!" he shouted roughly at the professor; "get</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a hundred pounds of modeling clay up here. Quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you can!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor trotted out after it without a word,</seg><seg type="columnLine">much less with any understanding of what it was about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you think you'll do it? was his eager attitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">one moment, and "if you don't you go on trial for</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder," he raved a moment later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Far into the night Heagey worked with modcling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clay, moulding the forms that had appeared in the labor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atory and some of those he had seen in hyperspace. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to recollect the order in which the various shapes</seg><seg type="columnLine">had appeared to him, and laid them in rows in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">order. Late into the night he modeled and arranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stared and studied. Near midnight the professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">poked his head in the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's really gone," he moaned. "She hasn't come</seg><seg type="columnLine">home. She's nowhere!" He turned on the haggard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heagey. "The policemen arc on the job, so don't try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get away. But I'm offering five thousand dollars to</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone who brings Sheila back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heagey snatched a few hours' sleep on the floor. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning when the professor opened the door, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was arranging clay balls and clubs into rows and staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">at them. As soon as the professor's head appeared, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted :</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got it! The biggest photographs you can get</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Sheila. Head and full-length both. And fast!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hurry!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He now turned his attention to the object in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas sack. He untied the rope from the fourteen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ounce duck, tied the corners of the canvas together, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted a stout stick (obtained by breaking the leg off a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair).and twisted it, squeezing the small ball of flesh</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmercifully. At first sight it was a cruel looking pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cedure, but there was method in it. The thing began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to jump back and forth excitedly. He loosened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulk of his pressure, but kept up a steady, firm tension.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His strength was sufficient to hold it fairly steady. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly he loosened all pressure. The mass of flesh sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly grew larger and the satisfied expression in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heagey's face showed that was what he was working</seg><seg type="columnLine">for. Just as when you push hard against someone and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then suddenly let go: he falls toward you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He persisted steadily along this line. When the cross-</seg><seg type="columnLine">section increased in size he held it loosely, patted it</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently, and even talked soothingly. As soon as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to decrease, he screwed up his stick and bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on it remorselessly. For an hour he wrestled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the professor entered with two 16 by 20 photo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graphs taken out of frames.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait!' shouted Heagey peremptorily. "Stand there</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hold 'em." He twisted up his stick again, held it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and loosened it; and was rewarded by seeing the bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rel-shaped mass appear; then two long, cylindrical bod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ies beside it, covered -with metal-mesh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's your idea?" the professor asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't bother me!" Heagey panted irritatedly. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't move. I might need you any minute."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally the thing decreased in size again; but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">tim$ Heagey seemed satisfied with it. He removed tli£</seg><seg type="columnLine">974</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas sack. There was an irregular sphere the size</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a bucket. Over its surface were queer patches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glassy places, and iridescent, rainbow-like spots that</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed color and looked deep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick now, the pictures!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heagey set up the pictures in front of the thing, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show them to it. The professor stared at him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would at a silly child. Heagey suddenly hit himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the side of the head with his fist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What a prize fool! I keep on being a fool!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted. He turned savagely on the professor:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get me the two best fellows out of the fine-arts</seg><seg type="columnLine">department. Quick! Sculptors!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the professor thought Heagey was crazy, never-</seg><seg type="columnLine">theless some glimmer of hope of rescuing Sheila lent</seg><seg type="columnLine">him willingness and speed of thinking. He scolded</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly into the telephone for a few minutes, repeating</seg><seg type="columnLine">the word emergency several times. Then he started</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the driveway, taking a policeman with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HEAGEY was feverishly busy. He seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing every object in the room that could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">conveniently carried, to set before the unearthly speci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men he had there. He seemed to be showing it things.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He acted for all the world like some ignorant, super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stitious savage, bringing things to his god. Books,</seg><seg type="columnLine">chairs, hats and coats, mathematical medals, hammers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wrenches, one thing after another; he held them up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of it for a while and tossed them aside on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing heap. When the two sculptors arrived, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">barked his directions at them, and continued what</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed his silly efforts to entertain the object in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him by showing it everything he could find. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">least it remained quiet and unchanged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sculptors, infected with his determination,</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked rapidly. First there was a model of a heavy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulging man, with his foot caught in a hole like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">eoal-chute, and held fast by a square lid. Then from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pictures a model of Sheila; considering the speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which it was made, it was a wonderful thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her pointed chin and curly hair all true to life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then a rough model of Heagey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heagey set the models down in front of the irides-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent, patchy Thing and played puppets with the models;</seg><seg type="columnLine">went through a regular dramatic performance with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. The models of Sheila and himself stood near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man caught in the trap-door. The imprisoned man</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled and knocked Sheila over and she rolled away;</seg><seg type="columnLine">she fell down off the surface of the block to a lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">level. The imprisoned man continued to struggle, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the model of Heagey searched around, but could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">get past the edge of the block.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, very impressively motioning toward the Thing,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as though he really believed it was looking, Heagey</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the model of the imprisoned man lean over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick up Sheila, and hand her over to the model of him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. The model of himself held on to Sheila, and raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trap-door that imprisoned the bulging man, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopped out of the hole and hastened away. That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little show that Heagey put on with the yard-high</seg><seg type="columnLine">clay models.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The patchy sphere changed suddenly. First it shrank</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then it swelled: then there were three or four</seg><seg type="columnLine">things moving back and forth. And suddenly, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood Sheila!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pale and distracted and wan she looked: and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed as she looked blankly around. Then her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">widened and she gave a little scream; but a look of</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace and content spread over her features.

"I'm all right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heagey stepped quickly to his switches and threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big one in and out again.

"It was a promise--for</seg><seg type="columnLine">finding Sheila."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor was sitting on the floor, writing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">check.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you think you deserve this?" he said testily.

Holroyd tried to elucidate his religious</seg><seg type="columnLine">beliefs, and--especially after whisky--lectured to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">against superstition and missionaries. Azuma-zi, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, shirked the discussion of his gods, even though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was kicked for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Azuma-zi had come, clad in white but insufficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">raiment, out of the stoke-hole of the Lord Clive, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Straits Settlements and beyond, into London. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had heard, even in his youth, of the greatness and riches</seg><seg type="columnLine">of London, where all the women are white and fair, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the beggars in the streets are white, and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived, with newly-earned gold coins in his pocket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to worship at the shrine of civilization. The day of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing was a dismal one; the sky was dun, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind-worried drizzle filtered down to the greasy streets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he plunged boldly into the delights of Shadwell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was presently cast up, shattered in health, civilized</seg><seg type="columnLine">in costume, penniless, and, except in matters of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direst necessity, practically a dumb animal, to toil for</seg><seg type="columnLine">James Holroyd, and to be bullied by him in the dynamo</seg><seg type="columnLine">shed at Camberwell. And to James Holroyd bullying</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a labor of love.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were three dynamos with their engines at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Camberwell. The two that have been there since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning are small machines; the larger one was new.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The smaller machines made a reasonable noise; their</seg><seg type="columnLine">straps hummed over the drums, every now and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brushes buzzed and fizzled, and the air churned</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily, whoo! whoo! whoo! between their poles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One was loose in its foundations and kept the shed</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrating. But the big dynamo drowned these little</seg><seg type="columnLine">noises altogether with the sustained drone of its iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">core, which somehow set part of the ironwork humming.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The place made the visitor's head reel with the throb,</seg><seg type="columnLine">throb, throb of the engines, the rotation of the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels, the spinning ball-valves, the occasional spittings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the steam, and over all the deep, unceasing, surging</seg><seg type="columnLine">note of the big dynamo. This last noise was, from an</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineering point of view, a defect, but Azuma-zi</seg><seg type="columnLine">accounted it unto the monster for mightiness and pride.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If it were possible, we would have the noises of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">shed always about the reader as he reads, we would tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">all our story to such an accompaniment. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady stream of din. from which the ear picked out</seg><seg type="columnLine">first one* thread and then another; there was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intermittent snorting, panting, and seething of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam engines, the suck and thud ol their pistons, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dull beat on the air as the spokes of the great driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels came round, a note the leather straps made as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they ran tighter and looser, and a fretful tumult from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dynamos; and, over all. sometimes inaudible, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ear tired of it, and then creeping back upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses again, was this trombone note of the big machine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The floor never felt steady and quiet beneath one's feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but quivered and jarred. It was a confusing, unsteady</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, and enough to send anyone's thoughts jerking</seg><seg type="columnLine">into odd zigzags. And for three months, while the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike of the engineers was in progress, Holroyd. who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a blackleg, and Azuma-zi, who was a mere black,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were never out of the stir and eddy of it, but slept and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fed in the little wooden shanty between the shed and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the gates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Holroyd delivered a theological lecture on the text</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his big machine soon after Azuma-zi came. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shout to be heard in the din. "Look at that," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holroyd; "where's your 'caihen idol to match 'im?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Azuma-zi looked. For a moment Holroyd was</seg><seg type="columnLine">inaudible, and then Azuma-zi heard: "Kill a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. Twelve per cent, on the ordinary shares," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holroyd, "and that's something like a Gord."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Holroyd was proud of his big dynamo, and expatiated</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon its size and power to Azuma-zi until heaven knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">what odd currents of thought that and the incessant</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling and shindy set up within the curly black</seg><seg type="columnLine">cranium. He would explain in the most graphic manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dozen or so ways in which a man might be killed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and once he gave Azuma-zi a shock as a sample of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its quality. After that, in the breathing-times of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor--it was heavy labotf, being not only his own,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but most of Holroyd's--Azuma-zi would sit and watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big machine. Now and then the brushes would</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparkle and spit blue flashes, at which Holroyd would</seg><seg type="columnLine">swear, but all the rest was as smooth and rythmic as</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing. The band ran shooting over the shaft, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever behind one, as one watched, was the complacent</seg><seg type="columnLine">thud of the piston. So it lived all day in this big airy</seg><seg type="columnLine">shed, with him and Holroyd to wait upon it; not pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oned up and slaving to drive a ship as the other engines</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew--mere captive devils of the British Solomon--</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been, but a machine enthroned. Those two smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamos Azuma-zi by force of contrast despised; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">large one he privately christened the Lord of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dynamos. They were fretful and irregular, but the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamo was steady. How great it was! How serene and</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy in its working! Greater and calmer even than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buddhas he had seen at Rangoon, and yet not motion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, but living! The great black coils spun, spun, spun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rings ran round under the brushes, and the deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">note of its coil steadied the whole. It affected Azuma-zi</seg><seg type="columnLine">queerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AZUMA-ZI was not fond of labor. He would sit</seg><seg type="columnLine">about and watch the Lord of the Dynamos while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holroyd went away to persuade the yard porter to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisky, although his proper place was not in the dynamo</seg><seg type="columnLine">shed but behind the engines, and, moreover, if Holroyd</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught him skulking he got hit for it with a rod of stout</seg><seg type="columnLine">copper wire. He would go and stand close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">colossus, and look up at the great leather band running</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead. There was a black patch on the band that</seg><seg type="columnLine">came round, and it pleased him somehow among all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clatter to watch this return again and again. Odd</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts spun with the whirl of it. Scientific people</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell us that savages give souls to rocks and trees--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a machine is a thousand times more alive than a rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a tree. And Azuma-zi was practically a savage still;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the veneer of civilization lay no deeper than his slop</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit, his bruises, and the coal grime on his face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. His father before him had worshipped a me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teoric stone, kindred blood, it may be, had splashed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad wheels of Juggernaut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took every opportunity Holroyd gave him of</seg><seg type="columnLine">touching and handling the great dynamo that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LORD OF DYNAMOS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">977</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fascinating him. He polished and cleaned it until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal parts were blinding in the sun. He felt a mysteri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous sense of service in doing this. He would go up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and touch its spinning coils gently. The gods he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had worshipped were all far away. The people in</seg><seg type="columnLine">London hid their gods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last his dim feelings grew more distinct, and took</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape in thoughts, and at last in acts. When he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the roaring shed one morning he salaamed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord of the Dynamos, and then, when Holroyd was</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, he went and whispered to the thundering machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was its servant, and prayed it to have pity on</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and save him from Holroyd. As he did so a rare</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam of light came in through the open archway of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throbbing machine-shed, and the Lord of the Dynamos,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he whirled and roared, was radiant with pale gold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Azuma-zi knew that his service was acceptable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his Lord. After that he did not feel so lonely as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done. And even when his work time was over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was rare, he loitered about the shed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, the next time Holroyd maltreated him, Azuma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zi went presently to the Lord of the Dynamos and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered, "Thou seest, O my Lord!" and the angry</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirr of the machinery seemed to answer him. There-</seg><seg type="columnLine">after it appeared to him that whenever Holroyd came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the shed a different note came into the sounds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dynamo. "My Lord bides his time," said Azuma-zi</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself. "The iniquity of the fool is not yet ripe."</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he waited and watched for the day of reckoning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">One day there was evidence of short circuiting, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holroyd, making an unwary examination--it was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the afternoon--got a rather severe shock. Azuma-zi</seg><seg type="columnLine">from behind the engine saw him jump off and curse at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peccant coil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is warned," said Azuma-zi to himself. "Surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">my Lord is very patient."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Holroyd had at first initiated his "nigger" into such</seg><seg type="columnLine">elementary conceptions of the dynamo's working as</seg><seg type="columnLine">would enable him to take temporary charge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shed in his absence. But when he noticed the manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which Azuma-zi hung about the monster, he became</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicious. He dimly perceived his assistant was "up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to something," and connecting him with the anointing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the coils with oil that had rotted the varnish in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, he issued an edict, shouted above the confusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the machinery, "Don't 'ee go nigh that big dynamo</seg><seg type="columnLine">any more, Pooh-bah, or a'll take thy skin off!" Besides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it pleased Azuma-zi to be near the big machine, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was plain sense and decency to keep him away from it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Azuma-zi obeyed at the time, but later he was caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowing before the Lord of the Dynamos. At which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holroyd twisted his arm and kicked him as he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go away. As Azuma-zi presently stood behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine and glared at the back of the hated Holroyd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the noises of the machinery took a new rhythm, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded like four words in his native tongue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is hard to say exactly what madness is. I fancy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Azuma-zi was mad. The incessant din and whirl of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dynamo shed may have churned up his little store</seg><seg type="columnLine">of knowledge and big store of superstitious fancy at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last, into something akin to frenzy. At any rate, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the idea of making Holroyd a sacrifice to the Dynamo</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fetich was thus suggested to him, it filled him with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange tumult of exultant emotion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night the two men and their black- shadows</seg><seg type="columnLine">were alone in the shed together. The shed was lit with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one big arc light that winked and flickered purple. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows lay black behind the dynamos, the ball gover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nors of the engines whirled from light to darkness, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their pistons beat loud and steady. The world outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen through the open end of the shed seemed incredibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim and remote. It seemed absolutely silent, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since the riot of the machinery drowned every external</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound. Far away was the black fence of the yard with</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray shadowy houses behind, and above was the deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue sky and the pale little stars. Azuma-zi suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked across the center of the shed above which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leather bands were running, and went into the shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the big dynamo. Holroyd heard a click, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spin of the armature changed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you dewin' with that switch ?" he bawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in surprise. "Hain't I told you-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he saw the set expression of Azuma-zi's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Asiatic came out of the shadow towards him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In another moment the two men were grappling</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiercely in front of the great dynamo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You coffee-headed fool!" gasped Holroyd, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brown hand at his throat. "Keep off those contact</seg><seg type="columnLine">rings." In another moment he was tripped and reeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">back upon the Lord of the Dynamos. He instinctively</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosened his grip upon His antagonist to save himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE messenger, sent in furious haste from t'n'e</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to find out what had happened in the dynamo</seg><seg type="columnLine">shed, met Azuma-zi at the porter's lodge by the gate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Azuma-zi tried to explain something, but the messenger</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make nothing of the black's incoherent English,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hurried on to the shed. The machines were §11</seg><seg type="columnLine">noisily at work, and nothing seemed to be disarranged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was, however, a queer smell of singed hair. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw an odd-looking crumpled mass clinging to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of the big dynamo, and, approaching, recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distorted remains of Holroyd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man stared and hesitated a moment. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw the face, and shut his eyes convulsively. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned on his heel before he opened them, so that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should not see Holroyd again, and went out of the shed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get advice and help.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Azuma-zi saw Holroyd die in the grip of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great dynamo he had been a little scared about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">consequences of his act. Yet he felt strangely elated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knew that the favor of the Lord Dynamo was</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him. His plan was already settled when he met</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man coming from the station, and the scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">manager who speedily arrived on the scene jumped at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the obvious conclusion of suicide. This expert scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed Azuma-zi, except to ask a few questions. Did</seg><seg type="columnLine">he see Holroyd kill himself ? Azuma-zi explained he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been out of sight at the engine furnace until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a difference in the noise from the dynamo. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not a difficult examination, being untinctured by</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The distorted remains of Holroyd, which the electri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">978</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cian removed from the machine, were hastily covered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the porter with a coffee-stained table-cloth. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, by a happy inspiration, fetched a medical man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The expert was chiefly anxious to get the machine at</seg><seg type="columnLine">work again, for seven or eight trains had stopped mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way in the stuffy tunnels of the electric railway. Azuma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zi, answering or misunderstanding the questions of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people who had by authority or impudence come into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shed, was presently sent back to the stoke-hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the scientific manager. Of course a crowd collected</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the gates of the yard--a crowd, for no known</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason, always hovers for a day or two near the scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a sudden death in London--two or three reporters</seg><seg type="columnLine">percolated somehow into the engine-shed, and one even</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to Azuma-zi; but the scientific expert cleared them</seg><seg type="columnLine">out again, being himself an amateur journalist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently the body was carried away, and public</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest departed with it. Azuma-zi remained very</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly at his furnace, seeing over and over again in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coals a figure that wriggled violently and became</seg><seg type="columnLine">still. An hour after the murder, to any one coming into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shed, it would have looked exactly as if nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable had ever happened there.

After all, from the mechanical point of view,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been a most insignificant incident--the mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">temporary deflection of a current. But now the slender</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">form and slender shadow of the scientific manager</seg><seg type="columnLine">replaced the sturdy outline of Holroyd traveling' up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and down the lane of light upon the vibrating ' floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the straps between the engines and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamos.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have I not served my Lord?" said Azuma-zi</seg><seg type="columnLine">inaudibly, from his shadow, and the note of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamo rang out full and clear. As he looked at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big whirly mechanism, the strange fascination of ft</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had been a little in abeyance since Holroyd's death</seg><seg type="columnLine">resumed its sway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Never had Azuma-zi seen a man killed so swiftly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitilessly.

What</seg><seg type="columnLine">I propose, gentlemen, is that we erect a number of huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea walls anywhere along the African and South Amer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ican coasts, where the warm equatorial ocean currents</seg><seg type="columnLine">gather their torrid waters on their journey to the north.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was this same current returning from the frigid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice-infected seas around the pole, laden with the chill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing waters of the Arctic Ocean, that gave our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantic seaboard, a land 011 one level with India, snows</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the winter and frosts in the fall, and during the late</seg><seg type="columnLine">springtimes, when the northlands thawed, it brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">along 011 its crest, as it returned to the south again, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge bergs of ice which proved a Nemesis to many a</seg><seg type="columnLine">noble ship. And this gulf stream still flows, gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men; it still flows trader the ice. It still continues to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring down the colder waters frotn beyond the Arctic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Circle and return to the pole with what little warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">water the tropics can yield now. That is the reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">why London, far above the latitude of New York City,</seg><seg type="columnLine">received the blast of cold only a little while before the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">huge American metropolis did; that was also the rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son why the aerial observers, with whom I am even</seg><seg type="columnLine">now in touch, are able to report a concave dent in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge sea of ice--hills that only a few months ago were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the North Atlantic Ocean.

My proposition then would be to build</seg><seg type="columnLine">a series of jetties of huge sea-walls and with each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these walls a very powerful electric heating appliance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some kind to heat the current as it goes north, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so on in relays more and more as the ice gives way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then watch out for the icebergs heading south and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flooded lowlands.

The major was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">robust man, tall and straight, hitting on the decline side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life. Long years in the uniform had given him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ramrod back that was as straight as any pine that grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the woods, and though a heavy man with the phy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sique of a heavyweight prize-fighter, he carried his two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred some odd pounds as a slender Indian carries</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hundred and fifty. An energetic egoist of a man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of the vitality of animal magnetism, brown-eyed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager, prematurely bald, forever grinning a grin that</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposed an even row of very large buck teeth, he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded me of portraits I had seen of ex-President</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roosevelt. Not exactly the man that one would choose</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lead, neither was he a man to put at the tail end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ranks. The clique of nations that made up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American Confederacy had seen fit to send him as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">representative to the forefront of the fight. I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, partly in the capacity of newspaperman, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">partly as viceroy of the father of the scheme.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">while later came a wall, a huge edifice of concrete, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an Aladdin's lamp had- been rubbed and a world was</seg><seg type="columnLine">working overtime.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nine months earlier the first diving bell descended</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its crew and sent word back that they had touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom of the sea, and the concrete foundation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first pillar of steel was laid then, four hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighty feet below the lowest valley of the waves. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">current was turning»and the warmer waters were flow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing north to meet the ice and end the glacier's maraud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing career.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was one-half a year since the wall had been com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted, the first of the lot, and already the big ice-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bergs were tearing themselves away from the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">-body and drifting southwards with the cold current</seg><seg type="columnLine">that came from the Arctic Circle under the surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ocean. In reality the Gulf Stream is a trio of</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm water streams, about one hundred and seventy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five miles wide with about fifty miles of cold water</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribbons between the three warm streams. But now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanks to the electric superheaters that received their</seg><seg type="columnLine">power via wireless from the huge dynamos at Victoria</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falls and the manufactured hot carbon-dioxide that</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmed the air above them, they became one wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream of heated water, and flowed with a daily speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of five miles along the American Atlantic coast and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then off toward the northeast. And as the glacier</seg><seg type="columnLine">melted and receded, smaller jetties, some of them mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">anchored sea walls, were swiftly erected at various ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantageous points and each jetty comprised a series</seg><seg type="columnLine">of huge heating coils that kept warm the southern</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters and here and there artificially generated winds</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept them going on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About forty miles of cold, water separated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gulf Stream from the American coast and this "Cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wall" was pushed rudely aside by a number of smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea walls anchored to the ocean's floor. This brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warmer waters so much nearer to the shore. Later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the ice gradually melted and as it lessened along</seg><seg type="columnLine">our coast, more and more of these "push-over" jetties</seg><seg type="columnLine">were put up, until just off Sandy ITook coast where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great warm water stream-current turns northeast and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the coast of the European nations, a huger</seg><seg type="columnLine">jetty was built to prevent the cold, under water flow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Arctic Current from undoing the work of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm Gulf Stream. Then, after the glacier had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">conquered, and the resulting floods allowed it, man</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanquished the ice still left on the high hinterlands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then man could start to rebuild his lost civilization on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a land bereft of everything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, day by day the huge ice wall retreated and, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it did so, it sent down from its torn breast huge moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains of ice, multipeaked, brilliant cathedrals, resplen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent in the sun, tall, silent sentinels upholding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">azure of the sky, the relics and fading monuments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our former destroyer and conqueror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One morning I arose early and peeked out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window, where Aurora, on the rippling horizon of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">east, had already made pink the skyline that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">as ebony all through the night, and merging sea and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky into one, had built a shimmering pathway of silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the crest of the waves.

A one-time fortunate erup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of Vesuvius threw up large quantities of hot gases</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cut a large patch out of the ice-field that covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Naples.

And then one day, when the warm air and</seg><seg type="columnLine">water spread and cut grooves into the ice-range, entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles fell into the sea as if by the stroke of a magician's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wand. Newer cities were daily planned and newer</seg><seg type="columnLine">lands were divided among those who had lost every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing when the ice came from the poles. Even now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">braving the terrors of the coastal floods, families were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping into the relinquished lands, slowly to be sure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but pioneers would never be pioneers if they came in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hordes or in vast multitudes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Famished nomads roamed the bleak interiors of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice-fields where cities and towns once had stood, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">where millions once upon a time had lived, toiled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">played, loved and died. There these desperate creatures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from whom hunger and cold had taken the final vestiges</seg><seg type="columnLine">of civilization, eked out a cruel existence by hunting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trapping, fishing, and robbing one another, and when-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever these methods failed, a ghastly cannibalism took</seg><seg type="columnLine">their place. Of course, many of these people eventually</seg><seg type="columnLine">found themselves in some outlying igloo village set on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fringe of the halted glacier where the first of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pioneers were awaiting the bugle-call to advance. Others</seg><seg type="columnLine">however merely wandered to and fro on the crest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glacier or finding a temporary nook safe from wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hunger, erected homes of snow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The broad prairies of the Argentine, the Chilean,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexican, and North African desert sand-wastes, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Veldt of South Africa's spared regions, the mountain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous countries of the Andes, Cordilleras, Sierra Madre,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the fertile vales, and the swampy regions of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tropical lowlands, together with the South Seas and</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts of Asia, were the havens of refuge of ten millions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The peoples of every tongue and clime started life</seg><seg type="columnLine">anew there, on almost nothing, and fought as only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desperate can fight for their existence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then one day the sun came out.

Clara left a letter behind her and even before I</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut the flap of the envelope, I recognized the almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">effeminate hand of the portly amateur of science, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">timely warning had saved so many lives.

Paul, she told me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had only recently arrived, and then she lost herself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the narrow confines of a rather diminutive aero-sedan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even as she locked the door behind her, my quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes caught the sight of a glittering diamond on her left</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, which, I knew well, had not been there for very</seg><seg type="columnLine">long.

"That these so</seg><seg type="columnLine">very interesting creatures were fairly on their way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">f»'d toward a kind of humanity is more or less ascer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained by the noticeable absence of any silk-sacs on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictures of themselves which they had left behind them</seg><seg type="columnLine">before relentless time claimed them, their last pictures</seg><seg type="columnLine">that are growing in number with each stroke of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick," the letter went on to say in part.

In the vicinity of the Teton</seg><seg type="columnLine">Basin, this government train was overtaken and looted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a gypsy band of famished snow-dwellers, men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">women, whom four years of hardship and deprivations</seg><seg type="columnLine">had returned to the cave ages. Upon report of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">newest outrage, one of the many of its kind, the gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernment immediately dispatched a small fleet of fast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily armed motor-sleds, accompanied by an esca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drille of flying machinery, to break up the boreal band-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itry that, like the attacks of the redskins of old, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in silence and stealth on the northernmost outpost</seg><seg type="columnLine">settlements. Even at his best, man is but a short three-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred generations removed from the caves and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hirsute, large-tusked forbear's ghost is with us yet, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">an empty stomach understands no rules and regulations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a battle during a snow-storm, the strang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est battle in history. Huge balls of snow, that became</seg><seg type="columnLine">huger with each turn, came down from the hill-tops</seg><seg type="columnLine">and buried part of our train in an a\ralanche. Machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns, tear-bombs, rifles, grenades, and aerial missiles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, soon routed the looters from their snowy fast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nesses. Like covered beasts, they fought the fur-clad</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers in ravines, on slippery mountain-tops, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners that the soldiers could take were few. As a</seg><seg type="columnLine">representative of a journal which was the first to decry</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coming terror, I was allowed to interview them--</seg><seg type="columnLine">emaciated men and women of another eon--and in scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered phrases learned the story of four years of terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">life on the glacier's back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were landed a day later in a temporary camp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still a bit scared and wild. Busy with my camera, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to notice the arrival of half a dozen Red Cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleds and they left before I was able to see Clara, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was among the Red Cross workers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A day passed, a day spent in motor-sledding back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the site of the proposed new national capital, Washing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonia. I directed my footsteps to the gigantic wood and</seg><seg type="columnLine">corrugated-tin edifice which housed the multitude of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards of the emergency hospital. A pompous, middle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged chief orderly with the imperturbable air of a floor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walker, let me know in a brief sentence, that neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clara nor the contingent of Red Cross sleds to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">she belonged, had as yet arrived. Then leaving me</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooted to the bare wooden floor of the building, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned and strode majestically down the long cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridor. his heavy footsteps echoing throughout the spa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious place. Later one of the night nurses let me know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that although they were expecting the arrival of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other Red Cross sleds at any moment, not a few fears</seg><seg type="columnLine">were felt for the safety of the few men and women who</seg><seg type="columnLine">made up the personnel of the train of sleds. A wireless</seg><seg type="columnLine">message from the military sled outfit with which I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been and which even now was scouring the snow cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered hills and valleys for any sign of the predatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">rovers on the glacier's back, had given warning to all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the outlying newly formed settlements to be on their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">guard, as hostile bands of crazed, hunger-stricken men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and women, those whom four long years of deprivation</seg><seg type="columnLine">after deprivation had hurled back into the antediluvian</seg><seg type="columnLine">eons and the days of the caves, were outraging the coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tryside with looting and murder. That night I slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EARLY the next morning, the rising sun still below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crimson of the eastern skyline, Major Cum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mins, only partly dressed and very unmilitary-like in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">four days' growth of bristling beard, broke wildly into</seg><seg type="columnLine">my tent and between pantings of breath, and accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panied by maniacal gesticulations, each of which threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened my clothing, strung out on a line between the tent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poles, told me in excited words, that Clara had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">kidnapped by a horde of hungry igloo-villagers who</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered themselves neglected by the food distributing</seg><seg type="columnLine">committees. She was now being held for ransom to</seg><seg type="columnLine">appease gnawing stomachs. Their terms were arbitrary</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the alternative too gruesome to relate. Fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes later we were speeding northward as fast as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">propeller-driven motor-sled could take us. At noon we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were searching the remains of what once had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Red Cross train of sleds. Night found us in the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">regions of the mountainous Teton Basin, south of Yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowstone National Park, still well within the chilly</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp of the Sixth Glacier. Only the snow-laden tops</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the many tall peaks protruded above the world of ice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which seemed to encompass all, as far as the eye was</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to see. The next morning we were prisoners in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hands of the starved villagers, who had seen us</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrive and had awaited only darkness and the night to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounce upon us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That an unappeased hunger had brought cannibalism</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon these unfortunate people, the many human bones</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered about their snow dwellings told only too well.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I pointed this out to the army man, who immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned pale beneath his stubby growth of beard. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">must make terms with them--any terms they like," was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that he could find to say. And then a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes later, "My God. My God 1" I turned my head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked at him. His huge head was lost in his pair</seg><seg type="columnLine">of huge fur-gloved hands. "Cannibals," he was say-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to himself, as if there were no one close enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear, "and we've only been married eleven days." A</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment later he turned to me, anxiety in both of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide-opened eyes. "But they're after good food just</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and not human flesh. Isn't it so, Bender ? They'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">never eat her. No, never. She's only a hostage to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that we bring the grub. We'll treat them right by</seg><seg type="columnLine">all means and promise to send up the chow-wagons right</seg><seg type="columnLine">away and they'll surely let her go. Don't you think so?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sure." My answer was almost an inarticulate "Uh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">huh," nearly a grunt, for my chin had fallen and I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a beaten dog. Relegated to the lowest liinboes was</seg><seg type="columnLine">my final shred of hope, and just like any other beaten,</seg><seg type="columnLine">love-sick swain, I was a silent, morose man. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">army had won again," was the sole half-audible remark</seg><seg type="columnLine">I made after a half-hour of wicked thoughts, before I</seg><seg type="columnLine">coiled up 011 my wolf-skin bed on the snow. A moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">later I was in a dreamless slumber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next day at noon, inside of his igloo, we stood face</seg><seg type="columnLine">992</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to face with the chieftain of the hungry tribe, a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">big and hirsute man, wrapped in furs. It was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult to surmise that sheer strength and brutality had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given him a footing on the clan's loftiest pedestal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had kept him there and even now allowed him to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">unqualified sway. Four young, thin faced women hov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered sycophantly about him, a quartette of fur-clad but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terflies. Three be-whiskered men, armed with rifles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood menacingly behind us. The hungry clan leader</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed me as the famished wolf would eye the well-fed</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog. Then for a brief instant his eyes rested on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Major's fur coat. "An army man, eh," he commented</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a leer that exposed a very irregular row of teeth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, old boy, we'll army you here, all right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For our words of succor and food from the govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, the burly men had complete contempt. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact of the general helplessness in the face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glacier and the vast magnitude of the ice-fields, never</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have entered his mind. He talked as a peevish</seg><seg type="columnLine">child might talk, who had thought himself unjustly</seg><seg type="columnLine">wronged. He never appeared to grasp the world-wide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the situation and answered only in an egocentric</seg><seg type="columnLine">way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If the government is so bent upon feeding us, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">why didn't it feed us all along. We were here for four</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, hungry all the time. One by one we starved and</seg><seg type="columnLine">died, and then, because there was absolutely nothing else</seg><seg type="columnLine">to eat, we ate the dead. Mere skin and bones they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, but we ate them. My wife and my four kiddies</seg><seg type="columnLine">died the first year, one after the other, but what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that to the big ones safe in the White House down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Washington? They had plenty to eat, I'm sure. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk about the Red Cross. Well, no Red Cross came</seg><seg type="columnLine">here in four long years. They just allowed us to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungry. And then you wonder why we steal. Anybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">will steal when he's hungry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My arguments and explanations, or rather my hasty</seg><seg type="columnLine">and puny efforts at such, were futile, for the man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to grasp the vastness of the catastrophe and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world's helplessness before it. It never entered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind that the very government which he thought had</seg><seg type="columnLine">neglected him so direfully, had been non-existent during</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of the four years during which he went hungry. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">endeavored to show him the wrong impressions that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">labored under, but as every word of mine tended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">enrage him, I realized the value of the ancient adage</seg><seg type="columnLine">that silence is golden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN we returned to our fur-floored prison of</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow, the major became voluble again. He feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">the teeth of these cannibal snow-dwellers for his young</seg><seg type="columnLine">bride; he feared the harem of the burly leader more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I allowed him to talk on for about an hour or so when</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the steady outpour of his Niagara of words he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">his one rational, although unconscious, remark:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I really do believe, Bender," he said, "that--that big</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow believes us to be on the square. He really thinks</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'll be fed and that we mean rescue, but then there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">really something else in the wind back there. Once upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time, you know, he had nothing, probably he was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a day laborer or a farmer. He's big enough, now, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever. He's king. A real honest-to-goodness King and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his word is law. He doesn't appear to be so starved to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Did you notice how they all jumped whenever he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke to them ? I did. A return to civilized ways once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more would mean to him, the return of a King to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">farm and the plow, or to the forge. You know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caesar answered the Roman Senate when they wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to come back to Rome and be second in command:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's better to play first fiddle in Iberia than second fid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle in bigger Rome." This man seems to think so, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A life of comparative ease now. Anything obtainable</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his command. I'm sure that he never went' hungry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And did you see his wives? I wonder if he intends to</seg><seg type="columnLine">include Clara in his harem?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In answer, I smiled an almost demoniacal smile. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">blighted lover, even at his best, is but a poor companion;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he is of very much less value when the victor is at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We received no food. I recalled the human bones</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I had seen scattered about the camp and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunger was appeased. The major, however felt other-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise. He cursed them volubly and in no uncertain</seg><seg type="columnLine">terms and told me many stories of savages who fed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their captives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe they wanted to fatten them," I answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly, but he merely contemplated me with a peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance and made no remark in return.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Late that evening, we heard a scattered series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots coming from the direction of the village, shots</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the mountains roared back at the sky. Five</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes passed riotously, then the tumult and shouting</seg><seg type="columnLine">died away. A minute later our three armed guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired twice apiece and then were lost beneath a pile of</seg><seg type="columnLine">waving arms and legs. A couple of fur-clad bodies hug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging closely, the snow that was even then swiftly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming dyed a gruesome scarlet, showed where two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guardsmen's bullets had hit their mark. Shouts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">"home again" and of "let's go back" reached our ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the main part of the igloo settlement. A sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolt, pent up by many cruel days, had burst forth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the big, fur-clad King was dead, his Kingdom gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his adhering sycophants scattered to the winds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Too many lean days had driven these men and women,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had known better times, to desperation and a de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sire to return to the civilized life that was awaiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. There was no King to stand in their way now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Little use it was to give them any assurance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety. These people had known terrible times. Most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them even doubted that the fight was finally won,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the glacier was even now retreating. "It's still</seg><seg type="columnLine">snowing, is it not?" they would say and regard us with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disdain with which one regards a prevaricator.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Even if the glacier has stopped due to your jetties,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it stopped only in the tropics and on the shore-lands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here we are too. far from the coast and too high up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air for warm sea currents to do us any good.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then too, these winters are so long, so very long</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and so very cold. Panama is too far a distance for</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, half-starved as we are, to travel over a world of ice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Locked in by these few salvaged mountain peaks, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are to some extent safe, even if we are hungry and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not care to risk the furies of the Arctic gales on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lower plain lands below. If the heads of this new</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SIXTH GLACIER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">993</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">government that you talk about really do want to help</seg><seg type="columnLine">us and are our friends, then why do they not send</seg><seg type="columnLine">us food and fuel instead of armored sleds and soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">with guns? Isn't Nature cruel enough with her ice</seg><seg type="columnLine">and storms?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "However, if you two are sincere and are really</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking the truth, then go home, let them know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">we stand here and return with pardons and with food.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'll find some way out after that. But no soldiers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for remember this" (and here a score of hard, sunken</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes gleamed upon the major) "we've got the girl. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">is our hostage and the ransom is food."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A newcomer entered the group, a cadaverous youth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollow-eyed and prematurely aged. In his hands he</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried some bits of broiled meat, almost black from</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much open fire. He handed it to me, reluctantly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if giving up part of himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For your trip," he said. "They'll give you some</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns too. Don't be afraid to eat it, buddy. It ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">human flesh. It's coyotes' paws. Kind o' burned, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">still betler'n nothin' at all. An' say, hurry back with</seg><seg type="columnLine">some real grub, will you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, here's one at least that has a bit of faith in</seg><seg type="columnLine">us," I told the silent major. My judgment, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was short-lived, for scarcely had we gone a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps when the thin youth shouted after us. "Hey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you guys," came his high pitched nasal tone, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not a little malice coupled with it. "Better bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grub, else we'll eat that girl." The major's legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">became springs that instant. "Let's hurry," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and bring them something to eat. The poor devils</seg><seg type="columnLine">are starving."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We found our motor-sled almost intact where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungry igloo-dwellers had left it on the night of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">stealthy attack. Only the wooden parts of it were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, for the nights were very cold here and fuel was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a premium. I started the motor and it purred</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopefully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then followed a quarter hour or so of silence. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">military man was drumming on the glass of the useless</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shaky door, which rattled with each vibration of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speeding sled. Once we passed a sample of heavily</seg><seg type="columnLine">fur-clad men on long and awkward snow-shoes with</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifles in their mittened hands. They walked laboriously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if the journey had been long and tedious and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow had been deep. One had a dead fox slung over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were now entering a slope made hazardous to</seg><seg type="columnLine">such travel by a series of very sharp curves. Huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">pillars of ice jutting out of the snow made speed im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible. I had just put all of my weight on the foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brake rafechanism which released a heavy spiked beam</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the soft snow under the running sled and at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same instant stopped the huge propeller which pulled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sled forward and had shouted to my companion to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take hold of the emergency brake lever at his side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I felt the icy floor beneath us giving way. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time I was aware of a crash that sounded like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">million ice-picks at work at once. Down we slid on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tumultuous crest of an avalanche, men, machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice, snow, rocks, for about a quarter of a mile away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the mountain-top home of the igloo-people that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">loomed like an island out of the shining flat back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glacier. A moment passed and we were pushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">our way fiercely and ponderously through a huge snow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank. Then everything came to a sudden standstill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We emerged scared, shaken, hut uninjured. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrecked auto-sled lay, a mass of twisted iron of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill. A long, straight trail, cut in the snow above us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed the route we had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's all over now, I guess," I remarked as I con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">templated the hopeless wreck. "And it looks like snow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Much snow." The sky was like lead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Night will be upon us soon too." Thus from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">major.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh well, it always is--sooner or later."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's four now by my wrist-watch. Is there no way</seg><seg type="columnLine">out? No way to fix 'er?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shook my head slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About how far are we from the nearest settlement?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Four hundred miles at a very conservative estimate."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Four hundred miles--gee! We might try going</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. Why not?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For answer I pointed to the almost perpendicular</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall above us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Uh. Oh, yes. Guess we can't, at that. No chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">for climbing. Isn't there some way to repair the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine, though. We have tools."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have them scattered over about a quarter mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">of snow. Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gosh, but you seem to take it easy. There's lives</seg><seg type="columnLine">depending on us, man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, what do you suggest?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Uh. Can't fix 'er, that's certain.

"The motor fell out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I got the guns, though. We very likely will need them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huh--what was that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sounded like wolves to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wolves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, 11 guess so. Wolves or coyotes. Better let</seg><seg type="columnLine">me have one of those rifles."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A LITTLE while later we were inspecting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreckage together. Repair was absolutely beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibility. In the rapid flight to the base of the hill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire fore part of the sled had broken loose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now buried in deep snow somewhere between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">base and the summit. The top and one of the sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">were crushed in. The radiator was gone, as was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">battery. One of the light aluminum-steel runners was</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted into a spiral as if done by a Cyclopean hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the light rapid-firer was torn from its tripod. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were lucky men to have escaped alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, it's no use ; absolutely no use," I told the major.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We'll have to stay until something turns up.

"They have sighted us. Keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to your gun, Cummins. Let's try to fix that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid-firer. It may come in handy.

Have you ar flashlight ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Night came upon us suddenly and brought with it</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind and snow. Ft fell in streaks, about as fast as</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow could fall. It never fluttered, it fell down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">chunks and small masses and covered everything in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few seconds' time with a blanket of smooth whiteness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At intervals of a few minutes, the vandal beasts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ice-fields mad with appetite, continued their weird,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ominous calls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It must have been somewhat past midnight, before .</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wolf-pack howled itself into enough courage to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack. The grim, gnawing pangs of hunger make</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the most cowardly brave, the most discreet reck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, the most lamb-like fierce. The snowfall had</seg><seg type="columnLine">abated to some extent, but the thick flakes were still</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming down and covering our wrecked sled, amidst</seg><seg type="columnLine">the twisted tin and iron, where we had taken refuge</seg><seg type="columnLine">from both beast and element. We had decided upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plan of each taking four hour shifts on guard duty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the other slept. I was allowed the first shift'</seg><seg type="columnLine">at sleep, huddled up among a pair of heavy blankets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the people of the glacier had returned to us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my own huge fur coat. It seemed only a minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">after I had fallen asleep that the major awoke me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the flare of the burning gasoline, I could see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes were weary, 1 ike^those of a man who had only</seg><seg type="columnLine">now left behind him a long, hard illness. He pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a couple of Springfields near at hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They sound nearer every minute," he let me know</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a low, sepulchral tone. "Once I was even able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the gleam of eyes, a score of twinkling, green pin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">points. Dark as all hell outside; and I'm sleepy. Keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">pouring gas into that tin-plate or the fire will go' out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they'll attack. No snow's falling in. I fixed our</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof, and fearing that the weight would crush it in,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I kept the snow brushed off. It's four o'clock now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">not so very far away from dawn, so let's hope for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best, There's some cigarettes on the seat next to you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Better light up. A fag is a good companion on a lonely</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch. I can testify to that. Good night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The night was cold and the wind blew hard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wafted to my ears the long drawn-out, eerie yelp of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the predatory beasts, made mad by hunger's unrelent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing lash. I found the major's cigarettes and took his</seg><seg type="columnLine">advice. Then, with nothing better to do, I fingered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the magazine of one of the rifles and made the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for combat at a moment's notice. The snow</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept falling steadily but as the wind came from an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite direction, it did not bother me. I was safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the shelter of the wrecked auto-sled. At times,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, the strong blast from off the plains threatened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to push sled and all over on its side and I began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have apprehensions, for our little stronghold. Also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the weight of the accumulated snow, the weak</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof was beginning to give way, protesting as it did</seg><seg type="columnLine">so with cracks and groans. So with rifle in one hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flashlight in the other, I crawled through the bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered door of the sled and out into the wind and snow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt as the storm-struck mariner must feel, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">is aroused from his slumbers by the call of the mate</seg><seg type="columnLine">at midnight, or when amidst the wild diapason of wave,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind, and human throat, he hears the most dreaded yell</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those who dare the seven seas, "All hands on deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">to man the life-boats." I lowered'my head like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry bull as I bucked the gale-driven snowflakes. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the near distance the wolves howled and I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reflection of my tiny gasoline fire in a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">green eyes. I fired a wanton shot and for a few min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes there was a silence. Then I heard the major's</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it, Bender? Ho, Bender, where are you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">His words ended in a scream and amid the crack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gun, 1 could hear the scraping of paws and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds of struggle within the sled. I arrived as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light went out, a wolf yelped a cry of pain, and Major</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cummins' gun barked out again, a stentorian, stacatto</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise above the howls of the hungry pack. A long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">furry body fell heavily at my feet. I turned my flash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light on the major. The man was a born soldier. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment I was at his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Light the fire quick, Bender," he snapped out in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a naturally commanding voice, sharp and sudden. "My</seg><seg type="columnLine">God, man, what was your idea in leaving. That's all</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were waiting for. It's a lucky thing for you that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you came back alive. Good, she's lit. Keep 'er like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. Our lives depend on that flare just now. Arc</seg><seg type="columnLine">you sure that we're safe on all four sides ? Better get</seg><seg type="columnLine">your light and see. We can't take any risks, you know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I wish it was daylight. Here they come again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Look at their eyes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three score green spots, flickering with evil intent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared suddenly in the dark about a hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">or so from us. The major had automatically taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">command, for it was battle and war was his trade. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">his advice, I poured more gasoline into our make-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shift burner. He fired three times in rapid succession</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a howl of pain rang out in the night. A series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, hoarse growls contrasted grimly with it as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfortunate victim of the old soldier's aim was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoured by his famished fellow hunters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've got to go easy on our ammunition," remarked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the major smiling and I began to like him a bit. Now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his own game, he was very different from the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN for a long while, it seemed a year, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">howling continued. It seemed to harmonize with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the voice of the wind. At the price of two broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket-knife blades and a cut thumb, I managed to cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">some strips of tin. Folding these into a cup-like shape,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we filled them with a gasoline, of which the tank hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pily was still rather full. Thus we had in instant readi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness a dozen or more of very crude incendiary bombs</seg><seg type="columnLine">in case of a second attack. The major had sallied forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the darkness and had brought back with him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">limp body of the second riddled beast, which fell quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the side. It was an Airedale dog, gaunt, shaggy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fierce, with a red hole behind his right ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wild dogs, not wolves," commented the major in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a more or less surprised tone. "Once upon a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SIXTH GLACIER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">995</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">man's best friend and companion, now gone back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the savage stage again; just as these igloo-people have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone back to the days of the caves. It caused men to</seg><seg type="columnLine">become cannibals; little wonder then that hunger should</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive a dog into a wild animal stage again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," I interjected, "it's only a few thousand years</seg><seg type="columnLine">since this was their regular life. Let's throw him out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the pack; maybe it'll ease their appetites a bit and</seg><seg type="columnLine">make them less eager for us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was at this moment that the first wild dog jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the opened door and threw me bodily to the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sled. I felt a cold snout at my throat and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosening my glove, got hold of a handful of coarse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuzzy hair. An icy paw clawed at my face and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a rumbling growl only a few inches away in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ebony of the darkness. I kicked the beast loose after</seg><seg type="columnLine">an effort and then as I arose, I heard the major's rifle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I picked up my own and fired twice at the open door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way where a dark shadow appeared to merge into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounding shadows. I was rewarded by a yelp of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain and then sharp teeth tore at my fur coat and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell again. I beat at the head of my canine attacker</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the barrel of my rifle and then the heavy body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my companion rolled on top of me, panting, fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently. Someone was tearing viciously at my right</seg><seg type="columnLine">boot and with the other I placed a heavy kick 011 a</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and as the teeth gave way, I heard a yelp of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain. Somewhere during the turmoil I had picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big wrench, the sole survivor of a large set of tools,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with this I beat at the furry assailants on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">major's back. A rifle is such an unweildy weapon when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the combat is hand to hand. The major fired once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, emitted a horrible oath, and then I heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounding of huge fists on cracking ribs. A moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">later I was on my feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the flare of our small gasoline burner, ghostly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the whirling snow drift, I saw an eager, waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">pack outside, red tongues licking icy chops. God help</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, I thought, if some of these hunger-maddened beasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeed in dragging us out from behind the compara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive safety of our little fort. With that I lit one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our improvised gasoline bombs and hurled it into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">midst of the yelping pack of dogs. For a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">they stood their ground nobly--only for a moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Four years of savage life had completely reverted them</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the primitive wolf-pack ages; it made them fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire; and the pack gave way as if struck by a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">furies. The major was still struggling and once or</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice I heard him curse. The next moment found me</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his side. I kicked, I struck, I tore, I fired my rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hurled my grenades. The gasoline burner suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out as a huge body fell against it. A dog yelped</seg><seg type="columnLine">loudly in agony and jumped through the doorway and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared into the night and the snow-drift, his side</seg><seg type="columnLine">smouldering with the burning gasoline. I heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock of the Major's Springfield fall heavily upon some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that cracked sharply beneath it, once, twice and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then three times and the next moment we were alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick, Bender," the major was speaking in an even,</seg><seg type="columnLine">-unperturbed tone. "Light that gas again, or they'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">back upon us. Damn 'em for a thousand furies. I'm</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sore and bruised all over. Help me get 'er out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was badly bitten and his fur coat was in tatters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blood streamed from a gash in his right temple and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was another in his right cheek. I rubbed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounds with snow and bandaged them with a piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">torn off my once white undershirt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next ten minutes were silent. I saw a maze</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sharply flickering green pin-points crawling slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon us. Indeed, these beasts, who had been man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">born companions for more than fifty centuries and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had throughout those centuries learned not to fear his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire and his noise, were coming back again with grim</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunger a sure incentive. Foot by foot they came,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly at first, and then more boldly, and in a minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were battling for life once more. Reaching for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasoline bomb, I was dragged outside, flat on my back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the soft, white snow, newly fallen. I had dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">my rifle in the short melee, but luckily still retained</seg><seg type="columnLine">my long-bladed pocket knife, the best of weapons for</seg><seg type="columnLine">close fighting. I felt the points of strong teeth sing</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep into my thighs and shoulders. One big furry</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow growled as he jerked madly at my coat-collar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One time I tore a hairy face loose from my neck and</seg><seg type="columnLine">received a severe gash on the back of my hand for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble. Three times I felt my knife-blade stick deeply</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the soft flesh and I fought that much more ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribly, as I heard the accompanying yelps of pain. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog tore at the heavily booted calf of my left leg and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the other I struck out at him madly and swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and arose automatically to my knees. A big dog tore</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose my fur cap and his teeth grazed my scalp. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment later I was aware of a warm trickle covering</seg><seg type="columnLine">my face. At the same time my knife sank again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brute's body fell away from me. Then I was hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward into the soft snow, face first, and crouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">together at the instant like a battling leopard who is</seg><seg type="columnLine">cornered by his foes. I heard Major Cummins shouting</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I got to my feet again, took two steps toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marooned sled, tossing a dog bodily into the air and</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from me, felt teeth sink painfully into the fleshy</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of my back. Once more I felt the warm ooze</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blood; then I was tripped and rolled in the snow</seg><seg type="columnLine">again; my head buzzing like a thousand bees. The next</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment a huge and ponderous bulk sprawled over me</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I heard the major's reassuring voice, soft as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother's, yet firm as iron, a blade in a velvet sheath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He fired once,, kicked a couple of canine enemies from</seg><seg type="columnLine">my limp form, and then I became aware of huge arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifting me into the sally port and the safety of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">sled. I heard the heavy slam of the door and the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant everything became dark, the Stygian ebony void</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all consciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ERE, drink this, Bender," were the first words</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard. "It's molten snow and it's as good</seg><seg type="columnLine">as water. I melted it over the gasoline. My God, man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but you are torn up. Lucky for you that you were able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make your way back to the sled as far as you did</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I certainly never would have been able to drag you</seg><seg type="columnLine">in if you were one foot farther away; and that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have meant the last of both of us. I had to fight the</seg><seg type="columnLine">996</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">devil himself, as it is; those brutes were savagely hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gry. There is not a solitary body left outside, nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a few bits of bones and hair and crimson snow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I opened my eyes and it was daylight. For a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt dizzy but after a drink from the major's prof-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered cup, full consciousness began to return. I lay on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the furs, swathed in crude bandages and red with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own blood. I looked at my companion, the man to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom I owed my life. His mien was stern; a military</seg><seg type="columnLine">mask. His shirt and his O. D. breeches were in scarlet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinted rags, his head was bandaged, and across his left</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheek was a still fresh crimson-colored gash, long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep, showing only too well what those deadly fangs</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do. I extended my hand, and I said, "I'll never,</seg><seg type="columnLine">never forget this." His answer was a smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had two long scalp wounds and a number of slighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones. My neck was badly bruised and some skin was</seg><seg type="columnLine">torn from my throat and chest. My left arm was</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat mangled by the sharp teeth of the canine</seg><seg type="columnLine">attackers and both of my legs and my back suffered</seg><seg type="columnLine">bites.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Noon came and with it came fever. I talked of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clara, mournfully dolefully, with ire. I cursed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">major. I shouted and I cried like a peevish child, shrilly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with force. Thrice, so I learned later, the soldier's</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong arms pushed me back upon my crude sick-bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blankets and furs. Once I tore my makeshift band-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages from my wounds and ran, semi-naked, out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snow. The imps of delirium had me in their ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible grip and it was only when complete exhaustion</seg><seg type="columnLine">had overtaken me and brought with it an icy sweat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I became quiet. Cold snow-packs upon my fever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flamed head relieved me a bit and I shut my eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowsed off into a restless sleep, broken by bits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bothersome dreams. I saw the savage, hunger-crazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">dogs again and I cried out to my companion to drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">them away. They were big dogs, giants, and each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them had the huge, bewhiskered visage of the selfish</seg><seg type="columnLine">ex-King of the igloo clan on the hill-top above us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then came Clara, clad in furs and with a big rifle scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered the dogs to the four quarters of heaven. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the major picked her up in his big arms and carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">her away, leaving me behind to the mercies of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad canine foe. I shouted curses after him as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him go. After that I awoke and asked for</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. The major handed a tin to me, and I drank</seg><seg type="columnLine">greedily, for I was trying to quench a fire within me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tottering on the fever-ridden brink of that borderland</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lies between sleep and consciousness, I shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the major to keep off the dogs. Then once again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I opened my eyes. Everything seemed foggy and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mist stood Clara, the major, tall and portly in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tatters, old Stephen Dunraven wrapped in many furs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and two khaki-clad men, one of them very tall and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin, the other short and stout. As if from a distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">and through the dull roar of a pounding surf, I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear words spoken. Involuntarily I shut my eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubbed them, and then opened them again. Clara, tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Junoesque in the olive-drab uniform of a Red</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cross ambulance driver, was offering me a drink. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice sounded pleasant and I accepted the drink. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">white-clad nurse was fixing the bandages on my head</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with swift, deft fingers that told of much experience.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dunraven was in conversation with the short, fat man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was busy with my lacerated legs.

Old Stephen Dunraven was in to see me yes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terday. He has grown fatter, grayer, grouchier.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, however, he is a happy man. Three whole pages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">amply illustrated, had I vouchsafed him for the story</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the days when the spiders ruled the roost. The big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">black cigar that he gave me was delicious, even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had to be a very patient listener to an arachnidean</seg><seg type="columnLine">diatribe that took up the better part of an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also 1 leaned that the Cordillerian ice sheet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">many years ago was nearly five hundred miles wide and</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended as far as Washington. As it came swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and steadily from the pole, it drove this spider race</seg><seg type="columnLine">before its icy fury to seek newer homes in more south-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern climes, where the Fifth Glacier could never go. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the region of the Deewatin Ice Sheet, which, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">an immense finger of destruction, reached down from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Hudson Bay countries deep into the heart of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kansan plains, came another race of spider people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">also fugitives from the boreal foe, and they, too, set-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tled at the site of what today is the Mecca of all scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tists. There the two races of spiders found the savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">ape man, our tree-climbing ancestor, and made of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hauler of stones and builder of cities. Later came</seg><seg type="columnLine">wars, as wars will ever come, where two peoples dwell</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to one another. And as the warring arachnideans</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaughtered each other, the glacier coming from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north turned the summers into winters and the temper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate winters into winters of Arctic climes. Nature, true</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its law of destruction of all that is unfit for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place and time, drove the weak spider race ruthlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the sand-waste regions with her icy lash from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">northern pole. Then the ape man lived wildly, amidst</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ruins of old-time grandeur for countless years, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a glory which he never could understand. Time slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried them as it passed on beneath its waste of cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turies till only the moulded tablets remained intact to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell of the history of these strange four-legged people</seg><seg type="columnLine">who lived, loved, fought, wrought and died there, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then became one with the darkest oblivion, fugitives,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like us, from the northern ice, they who had raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloft a civilization and were contemporaries of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn man, the auroch, and the giant-elk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In sharp, terse sentences, such an antithesis to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollow voice, the amateur scientist spoke to me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">every word of his speech sounded like a command</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a tomb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What strange manners of earthly life," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"even now lie buried beneath the soil, since the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit of animism crawled out of the bathybian ooze at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the birth of life, who can say?

Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">after his visit, somehow or other, I could not help but</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that in reality there had been two Stephen Dun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravens. One who had died during the Sixth Ice Age</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the other who, sphinx-like, rose out of his shroud,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tender, more contrite man, born of the other's ashes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he still dared to doubt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE great gardener had weeded his earthly gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den only too well and left but one-third of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">former one and a half billion to refill and recruit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. Discontent and strife followed fast upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels of the settlement of the reclaimed lands. People</seg><seg type="columnLine">still insisted upon recalling old boundary lines and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">petty hatreds of the past. Men and women wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">power more than they wanted homes. Newer nations</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang up, north, east, south and west, over hill and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dale, as soon as the ice had gone and the floods had</seg><seg type="columnLine">abated. The first comers, naturally enough, settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the choicest of lands and wars soon followed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then plague followed war as it often does, sparing</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither young nor old, and the grim, bony man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scythe easily settled the disputes that guns had</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to do. For ten years after the Sixth Glacier</seg><seg type="columnLine">had joined the hoary past, the heterogeneous popula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of Europe, and for thrice that long, the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">heterogeneous populations of Asia, grappled with itself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while those who had deigned to linger behind in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tropics fought the natives with equal fury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On this side of the Atlantic, however, things were</seg><seg type="columnLine">more quiet. A stricken one-quarter of a once one-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and twenty-five million came back in four</seg><seg type="columnLine">years to a land of many million barren acres. Towns</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang up on prairies and on hills or in vales, and cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">along rivers and bays. Farming commenced on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day that the first settler from the south set a rock down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ground as a stake, and said that these few sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounding acres are to me and mine, home. As I write</seg><seg type="columnLine">today, five years after the ice has left, at least for</seg><seg type="columnLine">another thousand centuries, the New United States of</seg><seg type="columnLine">America that extends from the Ivio Grande and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge Gulf to the icy top of the globe, is starting all</seg><seg type="columnLine">over again, just as it did once, nearly five hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago. Cities are springing up over the glacier-</seg><seg type="columnLine">demolished terrain, where other citics once had been,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the water-girded site of New York City, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad lakefront where once Chicago stood, on San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Francisco Bay, on Denver's mile-high altitude. Los</seg><seg type="columnLine">Angeles is rebuilding with a furore, just as El Paso,</seg><seg type="columnLine">New Orleans and Galveston are doing.

Europe, the five thousand-year-old hot-bed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">war and international hatreds, tired of arms and worn</seg><seg type="columnLine">by disease, decided to bury the hatchet and start a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">world on a better social plan. A protocol was sent out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the rest of the earth's nations. Thus the idealist's</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream of a Utopia may after all not be so far away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A catastrophe is sometimes the gift of the gods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Most of the huge jetties are still standing, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heating machines have long ago been taken down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and put to other uses. Northern Europe and the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">and central parts of our own Atlantic coast are even</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmer today than they were during the pre-glacial</seg><seg type="columnLine">years. The winters are shorter and less harsh and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the summers come early and linger long for the series</seg><seg type="columnLine">of small jetties that raise gray, concrete backs out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue sea are still at their duty along our coast, push-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the warm equatorial waters of the Gulf Stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward our shores and I, for one, say, let them stay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOW, allow me a bit of time for one more brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird's-eye view of the world as it is today. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sixth Glacier has become history already. New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">City is made up of islands no more. The sudden rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ice fields and the consequent passage for almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">five years of a mile thickness of moving ice turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">both the Harlem and the East rivers out of their true</seg><seg type="columnLine">beds, and now only the bigger Hudson flows into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bay where a newer and greater Statue of Liberty greets</seg><seg type="columnLine">it day and night. The once huge metropolis of tall sky-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrapers and Brobdingnagian bridges, of avenues of</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnificent houses and of more than five million souls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is now the hearth and home of but a mere half-million,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long, drawn-out city facing the open and almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">bayless sea. Here and there the faint trace of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">street may still show, strange prank of the glacier, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">every now and then one does come across some half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried scrap of steel or masonry which the morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice field had failed to carry away. The subway alone is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most intact, and although caved-in at scores of</seg><seg type="columnLine">places and full of debris of all kinds, it still is the New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York subway of ten years ago and New Yorkers daily</seg><seg type="columnLine">look forward to the time when they shall be able to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">it again. One mile of ice stood over it for four long</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, but it had borne the burden nobly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both Japan and Britain had been pushed out of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">sites by the glacier while little Iceland had been torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">in halves and shot two hundred miles to the south.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Isle of Man is no more. When the Sixth Glacier</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">retreated, it was no longer there. In the antarctic part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the world, the glacier had been more merciful, prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably because there was not so much to ruin. The ghosts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Capetown, Kimberly, Melbourne and of Sydney arc</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-day looking down from some municipal Paradise in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skies, upon the newer cities that have taken their</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthly places. Sahara is a sea, one with the cerulean</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mediterranean. Gobi is a lake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our own southern states, unfortunate victims of</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazed mobs from the north, are once more breathing</seg><seg type="columnLine">normally, and under the strain of the added millions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are living anew. Many of Cuba's newest population</seg><seg type="columnLine">have refused to return to the states. They seem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that hot little island, whose population to-day is</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty million.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But from Asia came uglier news. The yellow men</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the north have decided to stay south of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Himalayas. China, consequently is barren and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Russ is pouring into its fertile southern parts. Japan</seg><seg type="columnLine">retrogressed in civilization's scale for almost a thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand years, a tiny island kingdom full of hills and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers, that proved so terrible a death-trap to its fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions. Now about one million little swarthy men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and women live quiet bucolic lives in a barren, mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">land that was once opulent with pretty outlandish</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses and blossoming cherry trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Alps in Europe and the Rockies and the Sierra</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nevadas here have caught in their grips and have re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused to let go here and there a piece of the glacier</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it went back.

I finally uncovered it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it lay there shimmering</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the heat. My first</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance at it showed that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was somewhat different</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ordinary meteor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ite in that it was almost a perfect cylinder in shape.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not make out anything much about it on account</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its red hot state.

Easily it came off after it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">started and soon the cap lay in my hands. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling fingers I took the cylinder from the vise</seg><seg type="columnLine">and up-ended it. A glass case fell out on the bench.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But was it glass? It seemed to be, yet it gave like</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubber. It was without a seam; apparently it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been formed around the contents, which were closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled sheets of paper covered with writing. Finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">I took a pair of scissors and slit the container. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">manuscript fell out and eagerly I picked it up.

Ah, you ask, how can you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that and be on another planet? Wait.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I am Professor von Altenberg, once rated one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leading astronomers of Germany. I was a pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor at Heidelberg University when I began to experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment on devices to establish interplanetary communi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation. I believed that a rocket could be constructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that could be fired to Mars. This led to even deeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking and the consideration of the return trip, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be accomplished if explosives were used.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally, after several years of experimenting, I solved</seg><seg type="columnLine">the problem, or thought I had. I then began the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction of the car which was to take me to Mars and</seg><seg type="columnLine">return. I will describe it, but not in detail, as the space</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have to use in these cylinders is limited. Aluminum</seg><seg type="columnLine">was used for the outer and inner shells, toughened by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a process known only to me, which I will later give</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the world, if communication can be established. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think it can. Between the two shells was a filling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">asbestos packed tight. The cylinder was twenty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in length and seven feet across on the outside, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave it an inner diameter of six feet. But two feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this was taken up by compartments that lined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inner wall, so that there were only four feet of clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">space in the cylinder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On each of four sides was a porthole of specially</seg><seg type="columnLine">constructed glass, double, but so arranged that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision was not distorted in any way, The-cap of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket was of casehardened steel and filled with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">complicated mass of springs to break the fall when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car should light. Space forbids me giving the intri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate designs of the springs. That may come later.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just at the junction of the cap and the cylinder were</seg><seg type="columnLine">four small propellers, which I hoped to use to deflect</seg><seg type="columnLine">the course of the car, if necessary. I never tried these</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, so can not say if they would be successful or not.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beneath the cylinder were four legs, about three feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in length, on which the car was to be poised, ready for</seg><seg type="columnLine">its flight through space. Between these legs was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">propeller, which was to give the car its start and carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">it through the earth's atmosphere. Beyond that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">cap, which was highly de-energized in the gravitational</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense, would go for the body to which it was headed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulling the cylinder behind it. The construction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">propeller, which is one of the greatest strides in propul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion, will also be given to the world later on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About three inches from the base of the cylinder was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ring of a specially constructed alloy, which revolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a series of magnets and generated power faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">than it was used to whirl the propellers. You may</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt this, but I have proved it to my own satisfaction</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least. In the base of the cylinder were the dynamos</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other electric appliances for its propulsion. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">left me a space in the car of four feet by eight. Plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of room for one person.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I am going to cease telling of the details of the car,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because my space is limited, as I said before. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">messages are being sent on a Mernosian day, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is about every forty hours of earth time, for it takei</seg><seg type="columnLine">Memos forty hours to revolve on its axis. Twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours of daylight and twenty hours of darkness all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">year around. When the sun sets on Memos there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">MERNOS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1003</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">no twilight, but a swift transition from daylight to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark, and vice versa. The temperature varies but little,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and is about like that of the earth when the days and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nights are equal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cylinder at last was finished and sat on its four</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs, pointing to the sky. I tried to get scientists inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ested enough in the venture to help me finance the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip, for the building of the cylinder had impoverished</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I met nothing but ridicule and finally the University</seg><seg type="columnLine">took cognizance enough of my scheme to ask for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">resignation, as they said I was too hairbrained to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a professor at the greatest institution of learning in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world. My cylinder achieved fame as the vagary of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crazy professor. These blows hurt and I determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I would show these "know-it-alls" whether I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy or not. I sold all of my scientific paraphernalia</seg><seg type="columnLine">and used the money to stock the car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had no ties to bind me to the earth and I was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">outcast in my chosen profession, so I determined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike out for somewhere, caring little where I landed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had a month's wait until Mars was overhead. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a miserable period for me, for I was openly jeered</seg><seg type="columnLine">at and ridiculed. Even the children pointed me out</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the "crazy professor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally the time came when the red planet was above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I made 110 confidant of anyone, but secretly prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the trip. I had water in a specially constructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">tank that would last me for three months and enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">provisions for six months. I was more sure of finding</seg><seg type="columnLine">water at my ultimate destination than food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When everything was ready, I myself began to doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the feasibility of the thing. The jeers egged me on</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one of the strangest trips that man has ever taken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I got in the car by one of the two doors with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was equipped and made them fast. Then I turned on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oxygen restorer, which was a wonderful contrivance</seg><seg type="columnLine">invented by Dr. von Bethwig. A glance around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car showed me that everything was in readiness for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great experiment. Even then I hesitated to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the current that would send the car into space. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">would it? A haunting fear began to possess me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scoffers might be right after all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally I walked over to the switch and threw it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a mental prayer that the cylinder would go. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibration in the car told me that the propellers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">going and I waited for some motion to tell me that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on the way. There was no motion. The car was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a failure! I walked over to the door and threw it</seg><seg type="columnLine">open to get out. Suicide loomed before my eyes. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gasped with astonishment. The car was in the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rising fast!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I CAME near falling out of the car in my astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. But the air was getting very rare and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">made haste to shut the door. It was a success!</seg><seg type="columnLine">But was I headed in the right direction ? That thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobered me up and I went to the periscopic tube that</seg><seg type="columnLine">led to a mirror on the point of the cap. Yes, I was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">headed right. Mars was directly above me. I went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the portholes and watched the earth, now a vast con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave, as it slowly receded. I went to the etherograph,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a delicate instrument I had invented myself, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave the speed through space, and soon found that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was traveling at the rate of about 200 miles an hour.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But would the speed continue to increase as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I left the earth's atmosphere ? That was the important</seg><seg type="columnLine">question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I curled up in the car and slept, for the first time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">two nights. When I awoke it was pitch dark in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car. I went to the porthole and peered out. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still going. The earth was a huge black mass that cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the entire visible heavens, slightly luminous at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edges. Ahead the red planet still glowed, but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a splendor not seen from the earth. Everywhere was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intense blackness of space broken by the brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">points that represented stars. The outside tempera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture had fallen to 459 degrees below zero, and it stayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at practically this point all the time I was traversing</seg><seg type="columnLine">space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I will not go into details about the trip. Suffice to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say that the car attained a speed of 200,000 miles an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour before I started the propellers in reverse and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed began to decrease. So well did I time it that on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the twenty-first day out I landed on the surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars, with hardly a jar. The car fell over on its side</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I got ready to alight. My atmospheric gauge told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that the atmospheric pressure on Mars was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">about half of what it was on the earth. I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascertain the temperature as the thermometer had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet settled after its prolonged run at the absolute zero.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the doors was uppermost and I dragged out</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short ladder that I had for the purpose and opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">it cautiously. A rush of air from the car and then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the air of Mars, warm as a summer day on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. Another theory of the scientists gone! I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and looked around and exulted in the fact that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shown all those to be wrong who had ridiculed me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I stood upon Mars! The first man from the earth!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I started to dance and then I was startled. Instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopping up about ten inches, I went up into the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">a couple of feet! The planet being almost half the</seg><seg type="columnLine">size of the earth, the attraction of gravity was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequently less. I found that I could leap nearly six</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet straight up into the air. But the exertion fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">winded me on account of the thinner atmosphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All around me was a vast sandy plain, stretching</seg><seg type="columnLine">away as far as the eye could see, without a mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">peak to break the monotony, nothing but an enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">gulch that lay on my left. Far into the distance, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide as the grand canyon and as deep, it stretched, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it came to me at once. Here was the solution of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canals of Mars! The canals of Mars were nothing but</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge cracks in the surface of the planet. 'Not hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">made at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vegetation there was, but it consisted as far as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could discern, of only one plant, a short growth, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark yellow leaves and purple veins. Only about four</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches tall, it seemed to grow in .bunches on the desert.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mechanically I broke off a frond and a thick purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">sap ex tided. I tasted it. Then T tasted it again. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">1004</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was delicious. The thought that it might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">poisonous never entered my mind and I ravenously</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoured'the sap of the plant. Soon I felt that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">eaten a square meal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The soil of this desert was of decomposed granite.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evidently the planet was so old that the mountains</seg><seg type="columnLine">had all been eroded into sand--at least as far as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not a bird, not an animal, not the least trace of one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor of human life. All was desolation. But what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that? 1 looked again. Just on the edge of the gulf</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood a ruined wall! There was no mistaking it. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the relic of an ancient wall, built by hands. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">one time there was life on this planet, but how many</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages ago? I walked over and examined it. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">built of a stone, whose like I had never seen on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, of a coarse texture, brown- and yellow-streaked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I picked up a small piece and gave an exclamation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was heavier than iron, which meant that it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been as heavy as lead on the earth. The wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about three feet in height and formed a perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">square. What it had been built for I could not imagine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The walls had never been any higher, for there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a few fragments lying around and they came off</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the top of the wall where ages had loosened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cement that held them together. It might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred years old and it might have been thousands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aha! I had it! The walls were the tops of the walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a building and the shifting sands had covered them</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that the portion that I saw was all that remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the'surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Obviously, this was the solution of the situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stood gazing upon the scenery. The sun shone</seg><seg type="columnLine">as brightly as it did upon the earth, notwithstanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that I was forty million miles further from</seg><seg type="columnLine">it now. Flat, flat, fiat. Nothing to rest the eye in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast expanse of desert. The gulch was only a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet away and I walked over and looked into</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, then drew back with a shudder. It was fully four</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet to the bottom and twenty miles across.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How far it ran, I did not know, but the canals of Mars</seg><seg type="columnLine">so called, covered nearly the entire surface, so the gulch</seg><seg type="columnLine">may have run from pole to pole for all I knew, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">cared. There were indications of water erosion in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gulch, plainly showing that at one time a mighty river</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran through it. But where was the water now? Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drying up of the planet spelled doom to the inhabi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tants, or had they been carried off by sonfe terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">cataclysm before the water supply had failed?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here I was, one of God's creatures, alone, as I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed, upon a tiny speck in the vast universe, and forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">million miles from the planet where I belonged. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">many more of the tiny specks carried their load of</seg><seg type="columnLine">humanity in the vast realms of space? How many had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived out their span as had this one? How many were</seg><seg type="columnLine">just beginning to teem with human life? I stood mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on the inscrutable ways of the Great Architect of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Universe, forgetting my weird and strange sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roundings altogether.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly I was recalled to things Martian by a light</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch on the shoulder. Rapidly I turned around and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then T saw it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IV</seg><seg type="columnLine">Manos</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">USPENDED in the air about three feet off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground was a spherical body about a foot in</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter. Without visible means of support the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing remained there,' as steady as a rock. Surmount-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the spherical body were five tentacles, each about</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighteen inches in length. Four of them had fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the extremities while the fifth had an orifice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The body was so nearly translucent that I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blood pulsating through the veins. Underneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a rudder-like appendage that waved to and fro</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the fin of a fish. There were also two of the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendages at the sides of the globe. It had one eye, set</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the middle of the globe and very much like the eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a human being, except for the fact that it was pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple in color, with a red pupil. The globe itself was</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a reddish yellow shade, approaching orange.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As it steadied itself in the air, I gazed at it in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">apprehension, for I was unarmed, but it showed no</seg><seg type="columnLine">hostility whatever--nothing but curiosity. Then sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly the words were imprinted on my brain as clearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if they had been spoken:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whence came you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I pointed to the sky and answered:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The earth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is the earth?" came the question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No need of language here! The thing could read</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts as readily as I could read a book and could</seg><seg type="columnLine">project its thoughts as well. Project them so well</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I could get them as plainly as if spoken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The bright red star you see at night," I hazarded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Polus," thought the thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I became aware of others and turned. At my</seg><seg type="columnLine">back were six more of the globes, gazing at me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">undisguised curiosity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you called?" I asked, aloud, but the vocal</seg><seg type="columnLine">part was unnecessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Manos," came the thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what do you call this planet?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Manova."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the globes floated together and held a spirited</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought conversation, some of which I was able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get. After they had conversed in this manner for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some ten minutes, the one who had first spoken to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or I should say, thought to me, "telepathed" to me as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I may term it:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come with us to the great Samozar; he would like</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Readily I consented for I saw that there was nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but friendliness in their attitude, and the guide started</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead while the rest followed at my side. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually fishes of the air. and the fins kept them going</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the direction that they wished. I afterwards found</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were very light, being but a little heavier than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the atmosphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We went over the sands of the desert for about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile and then we came to a vast circular hole in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, nearly a hundred feet across. I looked down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw that it was about sixty feet to the bottom and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiralling it was a ramp that lead to the bottom. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">MERNOS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1005</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">went down the ramp while the Manos floated down "the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the pit, timing their motion so as to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">abreast of me. Gently as a feather falls they wafted</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves to the bottom of the pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the bottom was an arched opening and we went</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it into a brightly lighted passage way. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">never figured out the source of the light they had, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it must have been a kind of radium energy that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">last for ages. The lights were in round globes, sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended by a thin wire from the ceiling, and I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that there was no place for a current of electricity</seg><seg type="columnLine">to enter them. At intervals were lights of blue, green</seg><seg type="columnLine">and violet, which gave a beautiful color effect in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The passageway must have been nearly six hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet long and it opened into a circular room that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">about ten doors leading out of it. My guide conducted</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to a doorway on one side and through it into an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other passage that led for a hundred feet on a down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward slant into a small square room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And here was the .great Samozar ! Upon a cushioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">throne at one side of the room lay one of the globes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but almost a third bigger than any of those who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompanied me. He was of the same shade as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, however.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is this?" came the thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He comes from the sky," said my guide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How did he come?" asked the Samozar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I described the way I had come and the Samozar</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded in understanding. At least, he thought he un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstood. Since I have learned more about the mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">processes of a Matio, however, I doubt whether he did.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What are you called ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A man," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How odd! You a man and I"a Mano. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is where the former people of this world went to."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then there were people like me on this planet once ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"So it is handed down, but so many countless ages</seg><seg type="columnLine">back that we dare not think about it. Once the outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this world was covered with huge cities of stone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They are naught but ruins now. Who lived in. them</seg><seg type="columnLine">or where they went, we do not know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How long ago did you build this cavern?" I asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We did not build it," was the reply. "It was here</seg><seg type="columnLine">before any Mano can remember."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I found that the Manos did not have any traditions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what must have been their great past, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain of the Mano dominated the sphere. All they</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to know was that they lived. Truly a decadent</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain. They knew that there were three tribes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Manos still living on the planet, in different caverns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the race was fast dying out through diseases that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were too indolent to combat, and didn't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to if they wanted to. Altogether about five thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand of the Manos survived on the planet. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were of a composite sex and the young Manos, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were few nowadays, came from eggs. The average</seg><seg type="columnLine">life of a healthy Mano was about ISO years. Dfeath</seg><seg type="columnLine">came suddenly, for there was nothing but the brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">to die, and lingering sickness was practically unknown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their burial custom was simple in the extreme.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When a Mano died, his corpse was carried to the edge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great gulch and thrown over. There were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">other forms of life on the planet except in the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">seas that still existed at the poles. There a few fishes</seg><seg type="columnLine">survived. The Lupos, the sap of which I had eaten,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the only vegetation on the planet and it was every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where. It was watered by the numerous fogs that</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept down from the poles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I spent a week on Mars and found that there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very little to learn. The Manos knew next to nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the only relic of their past greatness was the ability</seg><seg type="columnLine">to transfer their thoughts. I visited the ruins of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cities that was near the cavern and found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was indeed the relic of a lost race. What were once</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnificent buildings stood in ruined grandeur. Over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few of the doorways that had not fallen were in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribed strange characters. I jotted down several of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these, which resembled English characters greatly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No traces of pottery or other articles could be found,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I hunted very sedulously through the ruins. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the shattered walls were gone. Then I made ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to return to the earth with my information---informa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that would astonish the world, if the world would</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Lost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HOW was I to get the cylinder in an upright</seg><seg type="columnLine">position ? That question troubled me. I studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">it from every angle. I put it up to the Manos.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But they could give me no aid. Had a thousand of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them been able to get around the car they might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised it. As it was, they were useless to me. Aha!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had it! The solution was plain, providing the sandy</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil was deep enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I would dig down at the base of the cylinder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">work the sand out from under it. Then the cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">would slide into the hole and I could tilt it the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the way. It seemed easy, but I worked for a week</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I got the rocket in a nearly perpendicular posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Finally to my intense gratification it was accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plished. ' I had it pointed directly at the earth. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Manos stood around in curious groups as I toiled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">my task, and if they could have cheered, they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done so when the cylinder slid down into the pit</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had dug at its base.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was all ready to start and I climbed into the car</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night as the earth drew near to the spot that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted it in. When, by the periscope. I saw the cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der pointed directly at it, I threw in the power and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again came the vibration. This time I did not open</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. I looked through the porthole and saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the red planet slowly recede, which it did</seg><seg type="columnLine">more slowly than had the earth on account of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinness of the atmosphere, which more than counter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acted the lesser gravity. I was homeward bound after</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the strangest trips, if not the strangest trip,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that mortal man had ever attempted!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the sixth day I had attained a speed of 100,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles an hour and was congratulating myself that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">two weeks I would be home again to give the scoffers</seg><seg type="columnLine">a taste of their own medicine, when there came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">1006</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">■violent jar and for a moment the car spun like a top.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was thrown here and there and received a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">painful bruises before the car straightened again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hastily I rushed to the portholes and there, skimming</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, was a gigantic black mass. I had just escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">being smashed by a giant meteorite! Had it been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few inches closer, my career would have ended then</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there, for the flying body would have burned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car to a molten mass by the sheer impact. As it was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it just grazed one of the legs, I afterwards found, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tore it loose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But where was I headed for now, and what would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be my fate? I was practically lost in the boundless</seg><seg type="columnLine">realms of space, for the earth was no longer dead ahead;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was almost in my rear and I was going back in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">general direction of Mars. But I saw that I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">miss that planet by a long ways. My only hope was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to land on one of the asteroids and from it head my</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder again towards the earth, so that I could get</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my ultimate destination. Forty million miles to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go before I got into the orbit of the asteroids, at least,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then no surety that I would hit one of them! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">only thing I could do was to go at top speed until I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">within several million miles of the orbit of those bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then slacken the speed and trust to God. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow or other I was not downcast at my ill fortune,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I seemed to have a feeling that all would come</seg><seg type="columnLine">out right. Should I miss any of the asteroids, I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">most likely be condemned to rove the areas of space</seg><seg type="columnLine">until' I died of starvation, and then the shell would</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally be cast on some far-off planet to cause wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the inhabitants thereof. But this did not seem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry me for some reason or other. I would come</seg><seg type="columnLine">through!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For eight days I traveled at the rate of 200,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles an hour and then I reversed the propeller and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to slacken. There seemed to be some body pull-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me along, but a close scrutiny of the ether ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed nothing in sight. Slower and slower grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speed of the car and then, looking out of the peri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope, I saw a black body ahead and approaching fast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was going to make a landing! I wondered how hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would hit. I could not slacken the speed any more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What was the body ahead? A dead world? It must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, for it did not shine with any refracted light, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">denotes an atmosphere. Would it be possible for me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave the car to re-set it, or would the temperature</seg><seg type="columnLine">be that of infinite space and too cold for me to survive?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was something that could only be known after</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had landed. Nearer and nearer drew the huge black</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere, in the orbit of the asteroids, where no such</seg><seg type="columnLine">body should exist. Its deadness had prevented it from</seg><seg type="columnLine">being seen from the earth, and yet that was a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, for the body should show some glow when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun's rays fell on it. I could figure out that it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trifle larger than the e^rth. Ah, this was the missing</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet of the solar system, but it was dead. Dead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I would be, too, ere I could get away from it. Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it was the end, I would meet it like a man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, like coming from darkness into light, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet took on a luminosity! And I was in an atmo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere! But T was traveling at the rate of 200 miles</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour. The periscope was useless; it was covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with vapor, caused by the warmer air of the planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">striking the glass of the periscope and the lenses, thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouding them up. I was going to hit and hit hiard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the end! I sat down on the floor of the car</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mechanically put my arms over my head. Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't know, as the shock would be so violent that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had every chance of being dashed into a pulp at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite end of the car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came the shock! But it was not the shock that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was expecting, for the cylinder shot into the waters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sea! Down, down, went the cylinder until I began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that the dense pressure of the water would crack</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seams, or collapse the cylinder. As I was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give up hope in the creaking car, it stopped its</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward flight and began to rise to the surface. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the damage was done. In one end of the car a thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">trickle of water showed where the seams had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprung, ever so little, but enough to finally fill the car</seg><seg type="columnLine">with water and drown me. I could not swim a stroke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mechanically I shut off the reversed propellers. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">daylight flooded the cylinder and I was floating on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doorway was right on the top, fortunately, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car rolled but little. I got out my ladder and climb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up opened the door and peered about. I was in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great ocean, but all was quiet and peaceful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ashore</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS I said, I was in a mighty ocean, apparently, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead ahead and a mile distant was a shoreline</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">-	and a sandy beach. Back from the beach was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great forest. The water was rising in the cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my only hope was to get it ashore or nearly so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I started the propeller and the cylinder moved ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the water. Nearer and nearer drew the shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when we w^ere about a quarter of a mile away, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a shock and the cylinder was aground! But how</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get to shore was the next problem. The cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">had settled in the water until it was a scant eight inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the surface and the door, and the vagrant</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves were breaking in it every once in a while. Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waves been anything like the waves of one of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthly oceans I would have been sunk long before I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gotten this close to shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If I had been able to swim, I could have made it</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily, but I couldn't swim, and drowning stared me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the face after breasting the terrors of interplanetary</seg><seg type="columnLine">space. But the tide? Was there a tide? At low tide</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could probably wade ashore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I made a mark on the side of the cylinder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiously began to watch it. Fraction by fraction the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water rose. The tide was coming in. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little hope, however, in the fact that it was rising so</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, for that indicated it had nearly reached its</seg><seg type="columnLine">height. The water was even with the door of the car</seg><seg type="columnLine">ere it began to go down again and I was drenched to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my shoulders. Besides, a light wind was coming up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the waves were getting a little higher. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water began to recede--very slowly it is true, but every</seg><seg type="columnLine">MERNOS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1007</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">slight recession helped. I began to take on new hope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun, which was a red globe in the east, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly sinking behind the forest. It would be dark ere</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could get ashore, but I was resolved to do so before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tide rose again, regardless of what unknown ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rors might lie in wait for me in those woods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">• I shouted several times but no answering hail came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the woody shore. Apparently I was on an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabited planet, or at least in the uninhabited part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. Anxiously I watched the water line in the twi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of the strange planet. Not a sound of bird or</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast came from the woods-- the breaking of the surf</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the sandy beach was the only sound that assailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">my ears. Down, down, went the water line, ever going</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster and faster arid my hopes rose correspondingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would be but a short while until I could venture forth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the darkness fell and the stars came out, shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a sort of dim luminosity that was almost uncanny,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the twinkle that they displayed on old mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, but a steady glow. Far off to the west hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">two red planets or stars, almost in a straight line, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 had no doubt that they were the earth and Mars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forty and eighty million miles away they appeared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same size, because of the fact that the earth was twice</seg><seg type="columnLine">as large as the red planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last I judged I could wade ashore and I slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the top of the car into the warm water of the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known sea. The water came to my chin, and I cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiously advanced a step or two. It got no deeper, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">did it seem to get any shallower. A few more steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I slipped down over my head. Frantically I ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead through the water, holding my breath and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head emerged again and I was in shallower water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I "had stepped into a hole in the ocean bed. Shallower</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shallower got the water and soon I was only waist</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep. Then I fairly shouted with joy as I ran the</seg><seg type="columnLine">balance of the way:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Saved! Saved!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But was I? What unknown terrors might lurk in</seg><seg type="columnLine">those forests? Little did I care. I was ashore and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was enough. Tired and hungry I lay down under</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tree and quickly was fast asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I awoke with a start. It was daylight and the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about an hour high. I had the feeling that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a presence near me, but a close scrutiny of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">surroundings failed to disclose anything, though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling that I was being watched kept its hold upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I shook off the feeling, partly, and began to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of something to eat, for I was hungry, as well as wet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Near me was a tall bush with a bright red fruit upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, which looked good to the eye. I reached up to pick</seg><seg type="columnLine">one and as clearly as if they had been spoken, the words</seg><seg type="columnLine">were impressed upon my brain:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't touch it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I jumped and looked around. There was not any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing or anybody in sight. Yet the warning had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">very plain. I started to reach again and then desisted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Over a little farther was a short bush with yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">globes of fruit upon it. I walked over to it and reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">for one, expecting to get the warning message again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I was hungry and determined to eat one anyway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning or no warning. But the warning did not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">come. So 4 took a bite of the fruit and ate it rapidly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was delicious, having somewhat the taste of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">banana with a pineapple flavor. Six of the fruits ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peased my hunger. Then I began to take stock of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my surroundings. The trees and bushes were very like</seg><seg type="columnLine">their kindred on old mother earth, the ground was cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered with a short grass of a deep green color, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were some flowers. One in particular I noticed. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fully ten inches across, of a deep purple, with red</seg><seg type="columnLine">edges and a brilliant scarlet center.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I saw the first life of the strange planet. Out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the woods came a great bird, almost as tall as I was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brilliantly marked. The body was scarlet with</seg><seg type="columnLine">white spots. The tail, shaped like that of a peacock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was many hued. It had a short blue neck surmounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a very large head, which was shaped like the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an earth bird. It was wingless and soundless, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly learned. Upon the head was a tuft of purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">feathers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Calmly and in a dignified manner the bird approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, showing not the least trace of fear. It was either</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to human beings, or else it had never seen one</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. Anyway. I knew that it had nothing to fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the forest, which was encouragement for me, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It walked around me in a circle with its head cocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">on one side, and as I held my hand out, it pecked at it</seg><seg type="columnLine">gingerly with its long bill. Then it turned, and quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dignifiedly walked back into the forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I scanned the woods carefully but could see no fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther trace of life. Then I turned towards the sea. Far</seg><seg type="columnLine">off in the west a speck was growing larger in the sky.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was it a gigantic bird or an airplane or airship? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not destined to know, for a twig cracked behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and rapidly turning, I had my first glimpse of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mernosian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Lorenda</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CALMLY and unafraid he advanced toward me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I will take this opportunity of describing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, for he was a representative type of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mernosians. He was clad in shimmery green tights,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a doublet of yellow, and with blue shoes that re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembled leather, though I have since learned that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were made of the fibers of the bolu tree. Upon his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a conical cap of a greenish metal, like the metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this cylinder containing the message^ I am sending</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the earth was made of. Upon his shoulders was</seg><seg type="columnLine">strapped a tube of the same material as the cap, about</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten inches long and about two inches in diameter, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which two wires led to a medal or small plate depending</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his neck and which contained two push-buttons.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rising from the cap were two small antennae which</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembled in the light wind that was now blowing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As to his personal appearance, he was exactly like</seg><seg type="columnLine">an earth nian, except for the fact that his features were</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicate, more.spiritual, and his complexion rather pale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he had advanced to within a few feet of me</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fixed his eyes upon me, and as plainly as if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken, came the impression on my wondering brain:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you from the earth or from Norros?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">1008</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 was astounded. Here I was on a strange planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the inhabitant of that planet surmised that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from the earth! I couldn't understand it. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental faculties were in a daze and I could not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">think an answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are from the earth," he thought, positively. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, he thought, for he did not speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How did you know it?" I asked aloud. He cringed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little as I spoke and I saw that he was unused to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds, so I tried to remember to think my questions</seg><seg type="columnLine">and answers thereafter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because only Norros and your earth--in this solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">system--have the same kind of people as we.

These people must be far in advance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people of the earth, to be able to travel thus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you call this planet?"

The skyline was not irregu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar. but symmetrical.

I remarked</seg><seg type="columnLine">this to the Mernosian, and he said that experiment ages</seg><seg type="columnLine">before had proven that this color was the easiest for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eye. The streets were uniform in width and fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighty feet. There were no narrow streets or alleys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the city was laid out in an absolute checkerboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">form. There were no small residences; all were tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings.

One was clad in black, the other were dressed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow. Later, I learned the significance of colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes on Memos. The highest person in a Torman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or political division, wore a suit of black. The Council</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore yellow. State officers of a lesser nature and over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seers wore green, as did my guide.

For instance, there are fruits in the forests that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we eat, though some of them are poisonous--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then it was you who warned me in the forest, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I reached for that red fruit?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. One taste of that fruit and you would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffered agonies for an hour.

Then you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">look like a Mernosian, except for your beard. There is</seg><seg type="columnLine">no law against wearing a beard here, so if you want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">retain it as a distinguishing mark, you are free to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">so. But if you want to have it permanently removed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, it can be done in an absolutely painless</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We descended by the freight elevator, which I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">not remember ever using again. Out on the street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Filos pointed to a Mernosian number on the building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Remember you live at 444 Filrom Street.

I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are not shops. They are merely exhibitions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You will find that these shops constitute a regular mu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seum. Of course there are a few shops, such as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuberer's and the clothier's shops and a few others, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the main, they are to show ancient costumes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">relics of the dead past."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I leaned up against a glass window to get a better</seg><seg type="columnLine">view of some of the exhibits and sprang back with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclamation. The glass gave like rubber! Filos laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">noiselessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our glass is flexible," he said. "It is unbreakable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">consequently no one ever gets cut on broken glass. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be cut with a knife. But, as we have no such thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">as thieves here, the articles would lie perfectly safe if</seg><seg type="columnLine">openly exposed. The glass is only for protection against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weather, as it rains here at certain seasons of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">year. To a certain extent, the rain is controlled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Rain Board, but that is something we have not per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fected yet.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothier approved my taste, and I was shown a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, where I quickly made the change and emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Mernosian, in apparel at least. Then we went to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cappers, and I was fitted with one of the conical metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">caps. I was shown a button, and by pressing it I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts come to me from a distance. This was what</seg><seg type="columnLine">the antennae were for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then we went to the tuberers, where I was given</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the tubes and the dependent plate which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">enable me to go through the air as did the other Merno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sians.

That dome</seg><seg type="columnLine">has stood there for five hundred years. Not that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old dome weakened, but a different arrangement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prisms was found that gave better results. It has</seg><seg type="columnLine">now reached perfection, we think. The prisms are</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the same material as the great ball, and are lighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">than they look. Here is one here. Hold it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I picked up the prism and found that it indeed was</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, lighter than any similar material that I had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen.

The Mernosian</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear had become so unaccustomed to sounds that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">least murmer was as the cascading of a waterfall. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandered through the maze of machines with Filos,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost in wonderment. I shall take neither the time nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">the space to describe the machines here. If I establish</seg><seg type="columnLine">communication with the earth I shall send a full de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scription of the principles upon which they work, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">. that the earth may benefit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But where they would get the crystal in such enor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous quantities is beyond me, unless it is possible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the crystal out of glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then we went up to the main floor and there I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found a few machines that had an almost familiar look.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were broadcasting machines of several types,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of which I could almost understand. One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar ones was the news-broadcasting machine in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">news-room. Here, in the middle of the room, was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadcaster, its Mernosian operator did not speak into</seg><seg type="columnLine">it however; he merely transferred his thoughts into</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and they were carried far over the state. Around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room at little tables sat Mernosians with disks to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ears and a pen and paper before them. I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquiringly at Filos.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "They are the newsgetters, and each one is tuned in</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a different sending station. As soon as a bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">news comes in, they write it on a piece of paper and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the messengers takes it to the broadcaster. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will answer your thought by saying that were the news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">getters to convey it by thought there might be con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusion. Afterwards all this news is printed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening papers for those who have missed the broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the play broadcasting room, plays were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">acted for the broadcasting machine that sent the plays</seg><seg type="columnLine">everywhere. This machine was beyond my compre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hension. A play dealing with our earth was being made</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I watched in admiration as familiar scenes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent out upon the screen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the food broadcasting room huge vats of food</seg><seg type="columnLine">were being cooked and the fumes gathered into enor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous horns, thence to be broadcast all over the state.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each day a different menu was prepared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wonders</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     yOW that you have seen practically all that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     there is to see here, I will take you to inspect</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> -A- 1 one of the airships and also the airship</seg><seg type="columnLine">stations. We will have to go back to Lorenda for that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Almost in a daze I followed Filos back to the city,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when we reached it, we went up to one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous towers that was used as a landing for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">freighters. A huge elevator ran up the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower to carry the freight to and from the airship</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing. These towers were all four hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in height, about a hundred feet in diameter at the base</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seventy, feet at the top, with an overhanging plat-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">form that was a hundred feet square. Filos told me</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tower ran a hundred feet into the solid ground so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was firmly anchored. The airships were two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet long and the bow and stern projected</seg><seg type="columnLine">far beyond the edges of the platform.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These ships of the air were made of the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">greenish metal and had no wings. They had propellers</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the sides and at the bow and stern. The ones at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sides exerted their pressure down and helped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep the ship on an even keel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do they run?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come inside," invited Filos.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once inside he took me to the engine or control</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, after seeing the captain and getting his permis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. The captain was deeply interested in me, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he learned that I was Guros Julio, the man from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, as he had read about my arrival in the papers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had heard it announced over the radio. T had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer several questions about my trip before he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">let us proceed. As he had made several trips to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, he was interested only in the car that had carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">me through space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the control room I saw a tube like the one I</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried on my shoulders, though it was ten times as</seg><seg type="columnLine">big. The propellers were run by little motors that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no apparent connection with anything. All kinds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of instruments were seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The car or ship can be closed airtight," said F.ilos.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then it can go clear up into the vapor belt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">renders us invisible. Several ships have reached a height</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fifty miles, and one took a load of scientists, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to get samples of the vapor belt and analyze it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They got the samples but the vapor defied analyzing, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are no farther along than we were five thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago in knowing what that belt is. It is evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">an element unknown. There is no other planet that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know of that has the same vapor except Hurmos, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the solar system of the star you call Polaris."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''I thought I saw one of these ships coming from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the west the morning you found me." I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Probably you did. If so, it was coming from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island of Rinos, where it had been for the alloy we</seg><seg type="columnLine">put with arror, the green metal to make the tubes for</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying. In no other place on this planet is it found and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the supply there will be exhausted in ten more years."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What will you do then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Bring it from. Povnor, a satellite of Jupiter, wheie</seg><seg type="columnLine">it abounds."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But how will you do that? ' I asked in amazement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will build ships that will traverse space, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not hard to do, as we have an alloy now that will</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroy all gravitation. We will make a large ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or several large ships, encase them with this metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">and go by planetary attraction to any planet we wish.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slides on the car to expose the arror body beneath will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the controlling method. There are two of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines in existence that have been to Povnor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">have brought back a load of the dunor, as it is called.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They came near being all killed on Povnor as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">superstitious inhabitants thought they were demons."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then that is what the Patrot meant, when he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a way was open for me to return to the earth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I</seg><seg type="columnLine">MERNOS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">10I!5"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly. And we will make such a car if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">tlesire to return to the earth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have overcome all desire for that. My only</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire now is to stay on Memos and to master mind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One is easily satisfied," grinned Filos, "but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other is a more difficult proposition. It rests with you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I wandered through the big airship and saw that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was built for freight only. Of course no passengers</seg><seg type="columnLine">would want to travel, for the tubes would take them</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they wanted to go. Then we went down through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air to the ground again and back to my apartment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and once there Filos brought in some books and taught</seg><seg type="columnLine">me the Mernosian characters. There were twenty-seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">characters and as many sounds in the language.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XIII</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mind Travel</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN got him to tell me what he could of travel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with the mind alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Concentration is the secret of it all. It will take</seg><seg type="columnLine">you a long time to master it, but I believe that you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it. You have a powerful mind. Sit each day and</seg><seg type="columnLine">think, think, think of sending your mind on a journey."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But if I get my mind out of my body, can I return</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is the easiest thing of all, for the mind always</seg><seg type="columnLine">wants to return to the body. You will have difficulty</seg><seg type="columnLine">in keeping the mind away from the body at first."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do the children have this power?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Once in a while an infant prodigy masters it at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the age of around ten of our years, or twenty of yours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but very seldom. It is never mastered thoroughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">until about sixty of your years in age."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I am not going to describe the time I spent in trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to separate my mind from my body. I had not succeeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the end of six months and had about made up my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind to give it up, as apparently I was not far enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced to master it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't give up," said Filos, when I told him this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It may come to you suddenly, when you least</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I determined to try it one week more. It was the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">day of the week I had set and suddenly I was looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at my seated body in the chair! I had succeeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last! Where should I go on my first journey? Back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the earth? Yes, that was what I would do. As I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hovered there in indecision, Filos came into the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, he has succeeded at last. I knew he would,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his mental comment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stood, in the astral, upon the planet that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left. All around me was desolation and devastation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huge holes torn in the bosom of the earth and villages</seg><seg type="columnLine">in ruin. Not a sign of life.' What had happened? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fled the scene of desolation and then I saw the cause.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was upon a vast battlefield and the armies of Europe</seg><seg type="columnLine">were tearing at their foes. It was in eastern France.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon one side waved the tricolor of France, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">union jack of England and the yellow, red and black</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Belgium. The flag of Russia with its blue cross</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was also there. On the other side the flags of Austria</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Germany floated side by side. I noted with pride</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the fighting was on French soil and I thought that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were destined to win. But why say "we?" I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a mundane being any more, I was a Mernosian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet a feeling of sadness came over me as I watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ghastly struggle. So many brave men were going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their deaths. For what? If only the peace of Memos</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be implanted upon this war-torn world. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was one country at peace, and it was prosperous.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In that country lay the salvation of the earth. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">country was America, where the lowliest man had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to rise, where ability and not nobility ruled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I returned to Memos and found Filos in the room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I reanimated my body, he grinned in happiness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have succeeded at last. I told you you would.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now it will be easier and easier until you can leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">and return at will. Where did you go?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To Julio."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you found ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A world torn with wars.

You will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to explain that saying to me some day, for I have heard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the 'handwriting on the wall' numerous times. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States will be forced into the war, but on whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">side I do not know.

Oh that they could have a taste of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peace of Memos."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Already you are more Mernosian than Jullonian,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled Filos, "and ere long you will, like us, look upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people of the earth as beings groping in a benighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">age.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not a place of flames and fire; it is a ball of radium</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy, with which the sun's rays are filled, thus giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">life to the peoples and the vegetation of the far-off</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres. I sensed that the temperature of the sun was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intense cold of space and as I stood there, the rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">of energy crossed and recrossed above my head, shoot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out into the blackness for thousands upon thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of miles. The sunspots were merely places where a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deposit of some kind, impervious to the rays, held</seg><seg type="columnLine">them down.	'J</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I exulted as I thought that I was the first of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth people to get the real solution of the mystery of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun and I must tell it here so that it will be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery no more. But will I be believed ? I am afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">not, though a man of science should know it must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">true, for otherwise the sun would have been burned out</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages ago and very few suns burn out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jupiter, the immense! I hung above the planet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked down upon a gaseous planet that was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proccss of formation. Here and there the bank of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vapors would break and I would get a glimpse of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">semi-molten surface of the giant planet. At times it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would boil and bubble and then it would seem to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost solid. Many ages would have to pass before this</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet became habitable. There were nine moons</seg><seg type="columnLine">around this great planet and I explored them all. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">my astonishment I found that one, two-thirds the size</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mars, was inhabited. But such inhabitants! They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were about five feet tall, with the bodies of lizards and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heads of frogs! Their attenuated legs were three</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet long, ending in a frog-like foot. The heads, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a frog's, differed in that their eyes were mere slits,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and upon their heads was a coarse reddish hair. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms were so long that they almost touched the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ended in six-fingered hands with double-jointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers. They breathed through the mouth, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">always open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In mentality they were like the cave dwellers of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth of ages ago.

They called Jupiter, which filled about a fourth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their visible sky, Muzit, and it was supposed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they went when they died. I have since decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this was the Jupiterian moon known to earth as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tronomers as Ganymede, and by the inhabitants, Zitzo.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our sun was sometimes seen as a bright, bright star,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimmed by the overpowering brightness of Jupiter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">They lived in mud huts in which they had enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">fireplaces and an abnormal lot of filth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I visited all of the planets of our solar system.

We</seg><seg type="columnLine">call that sun Onaro, but it can not be seen from here</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor from your earth. There the people are as happy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we are, as peaceful and contented, but they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced one step further. They can not only project</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mind to another world; they can usurp the body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dweller in another planet. We know that, for one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them did it here. That is how we learned about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Opar."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shall go to Opar."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will be well worth your while. Opar is, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Memos, ruled as one big country by a Council of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sixteen.

Opar the magnificent. It was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">at night, but instead of the starry sky I was wont</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see, only three stars were in sight and the moon ol</seg><seg type="columnLine">Opar. But to describe that moon! Not a yellowish</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden sphere as is our moon, but a thing of still</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater beauty. A bright bluish green, it cast a soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow over the landscape that lay before me, bringing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">into relief the gossamery buildings that comprised the</seg><seg type="columnLine">MERNOS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1017</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful city in which I stood. Bigger than our moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">% a third and moving majestically across the heavens</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a speed that almost made her motion visible, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a glorious sight. Long I stood and reveled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beauty of the satellite .ere I turned my attention to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city in which I stood. Then I looked around me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shimmering in the soft light were tall buildings that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have an irridescence of their own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They towered in the air majestically, large at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">base and gradually worked in, something on the order</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a pyramid. There was. a uniformity about them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and none were unsightly. Nor were there any low</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings: all rose to an average height of at least three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet. The moon's rays were reflected back</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the pavements in irridescent splendour, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pavements seemed to be made of a material with a sheen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it. Late as it seemed to be, the streets were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoid of people. Here and there Oparians were com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and going, and I examined them closely. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were like the people of the earth except that the ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">were very small, almost gone. They were about as</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicate featured as the Mernosians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the glow of the speeding moon I wandered</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the magnificent city that was about twice as</seg><seg type="columnLine">large as Lorenda and viewed many a magnificent park</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lake. Here and there, in large squares, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces of statuary that would put most of the statuary</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the earth to shame. Some of the groups were ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently allegorical and some statues seemed to be of</seg><seg type="columnLine">famous Oparians; naught however, that would bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">to mind warfare or strife. Those things had ceased to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be for so long that they were not even commemorated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a statue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like Memos, only beauty and peace and calmness</seg><seg type="columnLine">reigned. Yet I could not see that this planet was any</seg><seg type="columnLine">further along than Memos, except for the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had learned to usurp a body upon another planet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Undoubtedly this would be accomplished on Memos</seg><seg type="columnLine">also.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred years ago my story would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been utterly unintelligible to you. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">your science has made such strides that to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day much of my story will be entirely clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">to all. There are still many things, however, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists of your outer world do not know. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">my story may shed light on some of these things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My earliest recollections are of ceaseless movement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I floated in a fast moving current through a series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">passages or tunnels. The fluid in which I floated held</seg><seg type="columnLine">many other beings besides myself. We were all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shapes and of contours that would amaze you of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The size of the passages varied continually. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">very smallest were too small for me to enter while a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great number were only a little larger than myself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From these smaller ones they ranged t® a size so large</seg><seg type="columnLine">that many hundreds of beings like myself could move</seg><seg type="columnLine">through them at once. In the smaller corridors, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flow of the stream was slow but in the larger ones it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very rapid. And in four of the largest tunnels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it boiled with terrific speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These passages had a number of inhabitants. Most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them floated free in the stream but a few lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the edges of the tunnels. I belonged to what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will call the White Race. Few or none of the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals were as large as we. Our bodies were oval or</seg><seg type="columnLine">round in shape and somewhat flat 011 the upper and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower sides giving us a disk-like appearance. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluid in which we lived completely filled the tunnels</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we lived in it somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the fish of your world</seg><seg type="columnLine">live in the sea. We had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of very small and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin arms or limbs and by</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of these we swam</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the stream.' We could</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither speak nor hear but</seg><seg type="columnLine">by means of a sense, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">you do not have, we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to communicate with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one another. For the sake</seg><seg type="columnLine">of making my history clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you, I will refer to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of communication as speech. We were not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most numerous species in our world. The Red Race</seg><seg type="columnLine">outnumbered us hundreds to one. They resembled us</seg><seg type="columnLine">in appearance, except that they were even more disk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like and they were only from two-thirds to one-half</seg><seg type="columnLine">as large as we. Also, while we were white in color;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were a brilliant red.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In addition to the Red Race and ourselves, thare</seg><seg type="columnLine">were numerous other species. Most of these other ani-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">They varied in size from one-sixth the size of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Red Race to a few species slightly larger than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reds. Some were spherical in shape, others resembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">a curved, twisted or straight cylinder. Most of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">had tentacles or arms which enabled them to, swim.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Under normal conditions, these smaller animals formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one-half of one per cent or less of the inhabitants</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tunnels. Some of them were entirely harmless</seg><seg type="columnLine">but many were very ferocious and attacked the Red</seg><seg type="columnLine">Race savagely. The Red Race could not fight, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">their duty to keep the tunnels in good condition and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry food to certain animals that lived around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller tunnels. They also removed certain waste</seg><seg type="columnLine">products from the stream, keeping it pure. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">our duty to protect the Red Race, for we knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">if enough of them were killed, the impurities in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream would increase and we would be unable to live.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus our two races were mutually dependent. Neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">could exist without the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not know all this at first. My m-emory of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">earlier days only contains a record of passively floating</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the passages and absorbing food from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounding stream. But gradually I grew, in size</seg><seg type="columnLine">and became more active. Also my knowledge increased.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I began to learn my way about some of the larger pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sages. The smaller passages were so numerous that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">despaired of ever knowing one ten-thousandth of them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they were not so important to be known as were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the larger passages, for the current was so swift in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the larger passages, that it wras impossible to swim</seg><seg type="columnLine">against it. And one could only control one's destina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion by choosing the branch</seg><seg type="columnLine">passages to go into. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">current swept in a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle through the tunnels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It went from the larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnels to the smaller and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then through the smallest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and these small tunnels</seg><seg type="columnLine">were innumerable in quan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tity ; then it went into larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones and then through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">largest and then through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smaller again and so on</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the circle. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of the circuit varied greatly, according to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passages one took. Some of these passages were so</seg><seg type="columnLine">long and circuitous, that it was possible to make only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few circuits through them in a life time. Others were</seg><seg type="columnLine">very short. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before I reached my full growth I learned how -to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack our enemies, whom we called Ancytes.

This was worse for us than for the Nars, for the stream flowed from them to us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1020</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting you shall learn later, when I describe the Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Invasion. Since we were so superior to the Ancytes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fighting, you may wonder how we could ever be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger from them. But as a matter of fact we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">always in danger. And ceaseless vigilance and activity</seg><seg type="columnLine">were necessary to preserve our existence. Our danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">was due to the great powers of multiplication possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the Ancytes. If only a small group of them were</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed to breed undisturbed in some remote passage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. they would in a short time emerge in immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">multitudes. And we knew that if we were sufficiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">outnumbered we would be unable to cope with them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So we scattered ourselves far and wide through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passages and tried to keep every smallest alcove under</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch. Whenever any of the Ancytes were discovered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we either hunted them down and destroyed them by</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves, or, if they were too numerous, we signaled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to as many of our comrades as necessary to join in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hunt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Exactly where the Ancytes came from we did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. It was from somewhere in the great outside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They either obtained entrance through breaks in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of the passages or through places where the walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">were very thin in the smaller passages. They prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically always appeared in the smaller tunnels. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were two sets of passages where they were particularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely to appear. We kept strict watch over both of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these and as they were far removed from each other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we kept a good force near each.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The worst of these two sets of passages was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">boundless in extent and we called it the Black Labyrinth</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of the endless tunnels it contained and because</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ancytes that appeared in it were usually dark in</seg><seg type="columnLine">color. The other we called Narrow Places because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the small size of the passages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1HAD attained full growth and considerable knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge and experience when the dark day of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">race dawned. I was floating quietly near one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrances to the Black Labyrinth, when the word came</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Bors, one of the most active, but smaller species</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Ancytes, had appeared in considerable numbers in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Narrow Places. I knew at once that the situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be serious or even the news of such an event</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not have reached us. For, if the number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">White soldiers near the Narrow Places had been suffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient to deal with the situation, they would never have</seg><seg type="columnLine">said anything about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I, and a number of other White warriors, moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the larger passages, where the current would</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry us toward the Narrow Places. The Dark Laby-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rinth and the Narrow Places were almost at opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">ends of the passages and it was a long journey from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to the other. The circular motion of the current</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it possible to choose such passages, as always to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the current in one's favor in moving from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">place to the other. Were it not for this fact, a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderable portion of a lifetime would have ■ been ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended in such a journey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We moved from the smaller passages into the larger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the current moved very swiftly. In the largest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the passages, the current boiled and foamed with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">speed and we did not attempt swimming. AH our</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts were expended in preventing ourselves from</seg><seg type="columnLine">either bumping into the wall or into each other. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger tunnels were so big that as long as one did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt to move off into branch passages, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">little danger of bumping into the walls. But we fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quently had to make turns, and if one were thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the walls at this speed, it meant serious injury</seg><seg type="columnLine">or death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we approached the smaller passages near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Narrow Places, the current slowed down, and we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">again able to swim. We moved slowly forward, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">we knew we would receive word if there was any</seg><seg type="columnLine">very pressing need of assistance. We considered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bors very troublesome but not very dangerous. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were too small to constitute a real threat against us</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless in such numbers as to literally block the passages</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their bodies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We began to notice signs of them as we approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Narrow Places. These signs were small bits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">members of the Red Race who had been devoured by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Bors. The Red Race could not desert these pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sages without allowing the stream to become so filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with impurities as to prevent our living in it. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">they stuck nobly to their work in the face of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before entering the Narrow Places we decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make use of the fact that although the passages through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Narrow Places were innumerable, the entrances</seg><seg type="columnLine">were few. Thus the stream entered the Narrow Places</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather as a stream in your world might enter a marsh</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flow through the marsh in innumerable small</seg><seg type="columnLine">streams to combine into one again. We posted guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the entrances in order to confine the Bors to this sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the passages. Then we slowly advanced upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We found that the White soldiers already present</seg><seg type="columnLine">were winning even without our aid. The Bors had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been pressed back into the smallest of the passages and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were being slowly run down and exterminated. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">litter in the stream showed, however, that a consider-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able fight was taking place. Thousands of the Red</seg><seg type="columnLine">Race had been destroyed and the stream was thick with</seg><seg type="columnLine">small pieces of the Bors. We saw no White dead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many of the White soldiers had, however, temporarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">withdrawn from the battle to digest such of our enemies</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they had seized. We fight by grasping our enemies</seg><seg type="columnLine">with our tentacles and eating them. We do not eat</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you eat with a particular section of the body. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">can eat with our whole body, and we curl around and</seg><seg type="columnLine">envelope whatever we eat. Whenever we have envel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oped all we can digest,, we withdraw to digest it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then return to the fight. We could not afford to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you do in attacking an enemy, that is merely injure</seg><seg type="columnLine">him enough to kill, for the bodies would soon litter the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passages so as to hamper movement. Also the bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Ancytes, if left exposed to the stream, produce</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mixture that is poisonous to us. We must not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill but also destroy the body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE divided into small groups in order to search</seg><seg type="columnLine">the innumerable small passages. I and three other</seg><seg type="columnLine">PHAGOCYTES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1021</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of our race were moving slowly along a small passage</seg><seg type="columnLine">when far in front we saw several Bors. Instantly we</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashed forward with the Bors fleeing before us. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursued them through many winding tunnels until at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last we knew we were approaching the further edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Narrow Places. We knew then that we had them</seg><seg type="columnLine">cornered, for the entrances to both sides of the Narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">Places were held by our men. The Bors knew it too</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seeing our small numbers, they turned in a savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort to break through us and double back on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">path. There were perhaps twenty of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The passage here was only wide enough for two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to stand abreast, so I and the largest of the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">three of our men stood in front and the other two just</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind us. The Bors were only about one-sixth of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">size and bulk, but they were equipped with sharp teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as the tentacles we had. They were shaped like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short squat rod with a knot on one end. This knot</seg><seg type="columnLine">was their head and contained their teeth. They swam</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward in a mass and attacked savagely. I seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">three at once and began to envelope and kill them. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could feel their sharp teeth tearing at me and even bit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing off small pieces, but I come of a hardy race, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order to kill me, it would have been necessary to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tear me entirely apart. My comrade had seized four of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Bors and was handling them easily. I grabbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">two more and the end of this group of the enemy seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">well in sight, for we had not yet called on the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers we had in reserve. But at this time we heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">a noise in the passage behind us and saw some thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Bors coming rapidly towards us. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently pursued by another group of our soldiers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This meant that we were caught between two fires.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Bors behind us would fight desperately, believing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if they could break through us, they could escape.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was only one thing to do and that was to attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Bors in front and either annihilate them, or force</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to retreat to the entrance of the Narrow Places,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the guards would annihilate them and come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our assistance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We charged at once and the Bors were forced back</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short distance. But they understood the situation and</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not retreat far. There were only eleven of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">now but my comrade was rather badly torn and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat tired. We each seized two of them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then retired a little to let our two fresh soldiers attack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They accounted for four more but while they did so</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Bors from behind reached us. Eight of them seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wounded comrade and literally tore him into small</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces. Only twelve of them could come abreast, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">only four were left to attack me. I grasped two and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my friends seeing the situation, one of them came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my assistance, leaving the other to finish the remain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing three Bors between us and the entrance to the Nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row Places. The situation seemed desperate, when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a line of White warriors sweeping down on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear of the twenty-eight Bors behind us. Now it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">they that were held in a trap and the slaughter was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden and complete. The White warriors charged into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Bors with the impunity and deadly effect of tanks</seg><seg type="columnLine">among infantry. Not one of the Bors escaped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scenes like these were taking place all through the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          A-DARK LA8YRINTH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          A'-NFAR ENTRANCES(Tn, aqydintuI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          A2- FAR ENTRANCES (T0 LABYRINTH)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">         B-NARROW PLACES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           CC-PLACES WHERE THE PASSAGES ARE SMALL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           AND NUMEROUS.

But the passages were so numerous, that almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">our entire force was required to search them thor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oughly. We could not divide into groups of less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">five or six for fear of coming on some such situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we had encountered in the first part of the war. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were determined to do the work thoroughly and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to do so, withdrew our patrols from the Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">Labyrinth which had been unusually quiet during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bors War. The only precaution we took with regard</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Black Labyrinth was to leave strong guards at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all entrances. We were to regret this negligence sadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We finished the war in excellent shape. We lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than a hundred soldiers and most of these were</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed in circumstances similar to those in which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warrior with me had been killed. With this small loss,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had completely exterminated the Bors. It was true</seg><seg type="columnLine">that many thousands of the Red Race had been killed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they were so numerous that the losses could hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">be noticed. Also they were a prolific race and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural increase soon filled the gaps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We had hardly finished the Bors War however, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Red Race brought the most dire news. Their work</seg><seg type="columnLine">had carried them through the Black Labyrinth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they reported that the most dreaded of the Ancytes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Nars, were present there in great numbers. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nars were fully twice the size of the Bors and much</seg><seg type="columnLine">more savage and active. In addition, they had a weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">not possessed by the Bors. They could throw off from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bodies a poison which, if present in the stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sufficient quantities, would first paralyze and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill us. It was also deadly to the Red Race.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Leaving only a small contingent to guard the Nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row Places, the rest of our soldiers headed at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the channels where the current flowed toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dark Labyrinth. We had hardly started before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">received further and worse news.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Nars had attacked the guards at both entrances</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Dark Labyrinth and they were so numerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was feared that their attack would succeed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were attacking the guards at the Far Entrances</seg><seg type="columnLine">with particular fury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This meant a very grave situation for us, for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be long before help could reach the guards at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Far Entrances. The course of the stream was</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the set of entrances of the Narrow Places, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">! we now were, toward the Near Entrances of the Dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">Labyrinth, then through the Dark Labyrinth and out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Far Entrances and so around to the other entrances</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Narrow Places. Thus in order to reach the Far</seg><seg type="columnLine">Entrances to the Dark Labyrinth, it would be neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary either to go through the Dark Labyrinth, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was swarming with Nars, or to swim against the cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent and go back by the same route through which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to the Narrow Places, or, and this was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only route that left any hope of reaching the Far</seg><seg type="columnLine">Entrances in time to be of any use, to follow the cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent on past the Near Entrances of the Dark Labyrinth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on beyond the Labyrinth where it curved around</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a great half circle and finally came back by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Far Entrances. By following this route, we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the current with us all the way, but it was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">extremely long that we doubted if we could arrive</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still, since this was our only chance, we determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take it. A third of our force composed of the ablest</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighters and fastest swimmers was sent to follow this</seg><seg type="columnLine">route. The rest followed in a more leisurely manner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were to attack the Nars from the Near Entrances</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Labyrinth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1 FORMED part of the advance force. We swam</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly forward hunting for the channels where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the current moved with terrible speed. We did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely float with it but aided our progress by swim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming. The turns were taken at a desperate pace and</seg><seg type="columnLine">several of our number were crushed at almost every</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn. But we did not hesitate, for we knew that if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Nars broke past the guard at the Far Entrances,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would spread through the whole stream and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never be able to beat them. The stream whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seethed around us, but we still continued our mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace. Then we were moving through the smaller and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slower passages and were more than halfway to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Near Entrances. Next we approached the Near En-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trances. We saw no sign of the struggle that must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be going on, for the current flowed away from us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried such signs toward the Far Entrances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then we shot past the Near Entrances. In a brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse we saw hundreds of our warriors grouped</seg><seg type="columnLine">near them. We later learned that the attack on them</seg><seg type="columnLine">had merely been strong enough to prevent them from</seg><seg type="columnLine">sending aid to the guards at the other gates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The passages that go beyond and around the Dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">Labyrinth are small and we had little benefit from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">current in moving through them. We went at the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our speed. We must reach the Far Entrances while</seg><seg type="columnLine">our guards still held them or our Race was doomed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Red workers who were drifting through the pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sages were glad to see our warriors and told us that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guards at the Near Entrances were standing firm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they had no news from the Far Entrances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On we swept. Three-fourths of our journey was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clone. The passages were again becoming larger and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the current added to our speed. Our warriors were</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread out in a straggling line with the fastest swim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mers in front. The slower swimmers were thoroughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhausted and a stop was determined upon to allow</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to rest before attacking the Nars. But a fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our group, composed of the fastest swimmers, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided to proceed without a pause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I formed part of this group. Leaving the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our party, we moved on. Soon we were approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Far Entrances. We made a momentary pause to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reorganize just before turning the last curve before</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching the Far Entrances. Then we rushed on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we turned the curve, a terrible sight met our eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We had left over a thousand of our best warriors to</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard these entrances. Now we saw perhaps a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fifty badly torn and wounded White warriors slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving way before a swarm of Nars. The passage into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Black Labyrinth was very large. It was big enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">PHAGOCYTES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1023</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to allow two hundred of our soldiers to stand abreast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our hundred and fifty warriors were a short distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">down this passage and slowly retreating towards us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Nars are egg-shaped with numerous arms or legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking somewhat like an egg with a ragged fringe</seg><seg type="columnLine">.around it. The fringe is composed of their legs or</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentacles. The Nars have powerful teeth and jaws</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they were using them against our soldiers with</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly effect. The stream was filled with hits of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Red Race and pieces of our soldiers and of the Nars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was apparent that our soldiers were practically beaten.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But they still held the entrance!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We dashed into the fight at once. And at first we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were uniformly successful. The Nars were pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">back some distance into the Labyrinth. But they soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">rallied and returned to the attack. The stream was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with bits of bodies. And the Red Race had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost exterminated in these places. Their absencc</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant that the stream was becoming impure. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse for us than for the Nars, for the stream flowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from them to us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the Nars began to use their poisonous Emis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions, Many of our white warriors were partially para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lyzed and some killed. We were forced to draw back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the outer edges of the entrances, so that the pure</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream which flowed around the Dark Labyrinth would</seg><seg type="columnLine">wash away the poison®,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Nars seeing only a short distance between them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the open stream, attacked with renewed ferocity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We were entirety outnumbered. We had some 2,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors already at the Far Entrances and 8.000 more</seg><seg type="columnLine">were due to arrive. But the Nars were numberless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as fast as we killed off the front ranks, others</seg><seg type="columnLine">replaced them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This could not go on long. When one of our war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors was attacked by ten or more of the Nars, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate was sealed at once. Our front rank was melting</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. We could not retreat, for to do so would turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Nars loose in the stream. So our soldiers died</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the)' stood. Half of them had been killed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">many more partially or wholly disabled by the Nars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">poisons when our main force came up. They at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">took over the battle, while we received a brief rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We soon saw that even these numbers would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">insufficient to hold back the Nars for more than a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Where was the rest of our force? Why were</seg><seg type="columnLine">they not attacking the Near Entrances and sweeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the Labyrinth to fall, on the rear of the Nars</seg><seg type="columnLine">that attacked us? Unless they completed some such</seg><seg type="columnLine">maneuver speedily we would be finished. We would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not retreat while we lived, but there would come a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that time was not far off when there would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of us alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We were ordered back into the battle. I was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifth rank and so far entirely unhurt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I watched the Nars sweep against the first rank in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a raging mass. The line seemed to dissolve under their</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack. The second rank moved forward through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floating pieces of bodies to take their place. The stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">was becoming even more filled with bits of our war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors and pieces of the Nars. As I have told you, we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not only killed the Nars but destroyed their bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">by eating them. But when one of our warriors who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seized several of the Nars was torn in pieces, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bits of the Nars were turned loose in the stream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEXT the second rank was destroyed and the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved up to take its place. Our warriors seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">and enveloped thousands of the Nars hut still they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">on in apparently undiminished numbers. For every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of our soldiers killed, five or six of the Nars must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have died. But still the Nars came on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon I was in next to the front rank, and then we</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved up to the front itself. I was at the very end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the line with the passage wall on my left and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact gave me some protection. I seized two of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only four thousand of our warriors were left now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and many of these were both wounded and gorged with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bodies of the Nars. This gorged condition made</seg><seg type="columnLine">our soldiers inactive. The Nars, for some reason,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased pressing the attack for a short time. We after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards found that they were holding a council.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they came forward with renewed energy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in even greater numbers. The rest had done our war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors good and we met them with greater ferocity than</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own. Our front rank charged them savageh</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pushed them far back into the Labyrinth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But this proved our undoing. For our front rank</seg><seg type="columnLine">went past several side passages and the Nars came on!</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these side passages and attacked them in the rear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not one of them came back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Nars, encouraged by their destruction of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">front rank, attacked with increased vigor. We knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we could not hold out much longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But at last the longed-for event happened. We heat'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound of fighting far back in the Labyrinth. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">could mean but one thing. Our troops had fought their</seg><seg type="columnLine">way through the Labyrinth and would soon arrive to</seg><seg type="columnLine">support us. The Nars were caught between us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in a trap. But would the walls of the trap hold?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Nars realized the situation and attacked with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wild and desperate abandon that made their previous</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts seem tame. No longer did they spar for open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings with our warriors, somewhat as a wolf attacks an</seg><seg type="columnLine">elk in your World. Now they rushed right in, knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the first three or four would he killed. Under</seg><seg type="columnLine">such tactics, our soldiers melted away like snow' before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun. Soon there were only six hundred of us left..</seg><seg type="columnLine">We stood in three ranks. It seemed to he almost over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But in spending their energy in attacking us, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nars had left their rear almost unguarded and our</seg><seg type="columnLine">main force composed of some twenty thousand soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sweeping them before them. Fully three-fourths</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Nars turned to hold off this force, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest were to finish us.

From time to time</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head and neck writhed above the surrounding tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush-like vegetation, as he watched for possible ene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mies.

When he had reached the limitations</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the taller rushes, Tyranosaurus gathered his hind</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs under him, the final move before the charge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was not a test of strength he was about to enter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a trial of speed. The herbivore had no valid means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of defending itself against the meat eater and so de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended upon its ability to reach the comparative safety</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lake, into which Tyranosaurus would not follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.

Being much</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than half the size of its larger companion, it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally cooled much more quickly and at a far earlier</seg><seg type="columnLine">period was capable of supporting life. And life, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its incomprehensible purpose and apparently aimless</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggles, immediately took possession of the diminu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive globe. It developed and prospered, reached its</seg><seg type="columnLine">maturity and then the moon began to die.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though evolution upon the satellite had not pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded along the same lines as that upon the earth, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had produced, as a climax, an intelligence which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in advance of that existing in man upon the terrestrial</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere to-day. The creatures representing the pinnacle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of lunarian intelligence were confined to a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">species, and had been able, for an enormous period of</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, to support their life upon the moon by artificial</seg><seg type="columnLine">methods. However, thousands of years before the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">actual occurrence, the lunarian scientists had predicted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the necessary chemicals, mineral ores, and natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">gases used for the manufacture of the artificial foods,</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, water and other staples of life, would disappear un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der pressure of constant use. It was apparent that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only course left when such a condition arose would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave the moon for another celestial body, and natu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rally, as the earth was the nearest, the migration' would</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn in that direction. For this purpose, through thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands of years, the lunarian scientists had been work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, the progress coming closer and closer to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">achievement throughout the centuries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It thus developed, that, just before the extinction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dinosaurs upon earth, the accrued knowledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of years of lunarian toil was possessed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">one individual, who had, from this tremendous research</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, evolved a machine which he believed could con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vey him and his race to the safety of the terrestrial</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet. This machine came none too soon, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for already the life on the higher mountains was fleeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the lowlands. There was, therefore, no time for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scientists to make trial flights in which to make cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain of the ability of his machine to cross the fearful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">limitless abyss or to ascertain whether or not his race</seg><seg type="columnLine">could exist upon the new world into whose characteris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tics, though so near, the lunarians had been unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">probe very deeply. The inventor, under these pressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">urgencies, decided that he and a number of the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant scientific minds in his world would embark on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this greatest of all journeys as soon as conditions al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed. If it was successful, he would return alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">and direct the completion of the thousands of inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetary cars then under construction and the immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">migration would begin. It was urgently necessary that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he should return, for he alone understood the intricate</seg><seg type="columnLine">and complex machinery of the cars. Without him all</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be lost. All other occupations had been long</seg><seg type="columnLine">since abandoned, and the whole lunarian world waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathlessly for the hourly reports coming from all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">its surface to the great underground workshop where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vehicle to convey the inventor and his colleagues</seg><seg type="columnLine">was receiving its last overhauling and testing. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">purport was monotonously the same; one after another</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gigantic air manufacturing plants ceased work for</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of materials, the heat-dispensing centers gave out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the lighting systems were failing. The lunarian</seg><seg type="columnLine">populace, as a body, were moving to the three great</seg><seg type="columnLine">workshops, where the migration would start, and here</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumor and panicky fear had run riot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The testing and stocking of the inventor's private</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine were soon completed, and as they were just</seg><seg type="columnLine">entering the moon's long night, the inventor determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">that before the next daylight he would have left for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth. It is perhaps well to explain here that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunarian night is now about twenty-nine earthly days in</seg><seg type="columnLine">length and was, even at that early period, but little</seg><seg type="columnLine">shorter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The workshop in which the completed machine was</seg><seg type="columnLine">housed was situated at the end of a long, narrow valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">between stark, rugged mountains, high beyond all com-'</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehension. These terrific piles ranged miles into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky, fantastic and abrupt in outline and formed :a fitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DEATH OF THE MOON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">3027</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">background for this strangest of all ventures.

It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be, as it awaited the appearance of the tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">orb of the earth over the guarding mountains, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">dread messenger of Fate, sombrely indifferent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UNDERGROUND all was seething bustle; in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">workshop last minute tests were being taken, har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nesses were donned and strange apparatus were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone over minutely. In the great underground cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers beneath the main valley floor the mightiest con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">course ever gathered together awaited, with tense</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotions, the signal which would send them rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the surface. At last it came and in a trice the valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">was filled to overflowing, all eyes concentrated upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dominant figure of the cylinder upon the platform.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A death-like silence fell, the mountains, the lunarians,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car itself seemed waiting the appearance of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">great adventurers, who dared the very depths of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">finity. Then a trap-door beside the car opened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scientists filed out, all immediately enteririg the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine with the exception of the inventor who care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully went over its entire exterior. Finishing his in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spection, he turned and gazed out upon his fellows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had come to see him off in this most monstrous of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all journeys. In him lay their hope of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In one way only he resembled a human; he stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">upright. In every other way he had progressed along</seg><seg type="columnLine">different lines of development. His body was curiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">like some of the lower terrestrial animals in that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was segmented though the segmentation ceased at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a portion which could be called the thorax, as the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">was immediately joined to this latter part. He possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">six limbs, all of whose extremities were equipped With</seg><seg type="columnLine">elongations resembling digits, but which were much</seg><seg type="columnLine">more flexible. Each so-called digit contained a number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of strong sucking organs. The entire body was encased</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a bard, horny substance which was jointed frequently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His head was, in contrast, covered with some growth</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembling fur which completely encircled the large</seg><seg type="columnLine">compound, eyes and side closing, horn-like jaws. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">used only two limbs for walking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dressed in thick, cold-resisting clothes and carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">a heavy helmet, he presented a peculiar figure. On all</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides were the tremendous mountains; behind him was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sullen machine, while slowly creeping down the val-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley floor, over the heads of the lunarians, showed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">baleful green light of the great earth orb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What strange thoughts and feelings roamed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mind of this being who thought to wander at will</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the motionless, boundless depths of eternal space as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he bade good-bye to his world? Did some prophetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">foreboding stir uneasily in the depths of his mind?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Silently he looked and silently his fellows returned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">look; then he turned and entered the cylinder. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">great circular door clanged shut, sounding weirdly hol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low in that silent valley, the powerful mechanism be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the rocket-like ear slowly, in dead silence, raised</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it until its nose pointed into the far, mysterious reaches</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the star-studded sky, and all was ready for the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentous journey ever conceived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All was tensely, strainedly silent in the valley; from</seg><seg type="columnLine">high above, the earth-orb looked down, coldly imper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal, flooding the valley and the jagged peaks in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strange, green light; beyond it innumerable stars sar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">donically watched this attempt to avoid the inevitable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and upon the platform rested the planet car, seemingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for some remote call to send it hurrying into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness above. For ages, it seemed, the portentous</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence held, all motion lost, then came a tremendous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth-shaking roar and, in a monstrous cloud of green-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish vapor, the sky car flashed away on its fearful plunge</seg><seg type="columnLine">into space. In heavy silence, the lunarians departed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the valley and left it once more to the de-olate</seg><seg type="columnLine">solitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONCE more the warm, golden sun shed his hazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">effulgence over the vast, prehistoric American</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain.

Strange and heavily armored insects zoomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rumbled among the reed-beds and high above, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">high as to be barely distinguishable against the faultless</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue of the sky-vault, some distant progenitor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense bird-life to be, swung on motionless wings in</seg><seg type="columnLine">great continuous circles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without any jarring effect on this somnolent peace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deep, resonant thrumming became gradually percept-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible, increasing in volume until a pointed, winged cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der from which the sound came, appeared from behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliff and sank gently into the rushes. For some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time it lay there, without sign of life, but at last the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick, circular door opened, and the lunarian inventor</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped boldly into the earthly sunlight.

He had, therefore, been a witness to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landing and primary exploration of the lunarians.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For some reason he had not attacked them, but after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few hours, he returned to the depths of the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he would have probably remained, had it not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been for the moon-men. Led on by wonder after won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, the latter had wandered farther and farther afield,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on the second day decided to explore part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle on the cliff before the inventor left. As yet they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen none of the great dinosaurs and had no knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lunarians set out in a body and, after laboriously</seg><seg type="columnLine">scaling the face of the cliff, proceeded directly into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dense, tropical woodland. This afforded them much of</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest and after aimlessly drifting from one object to</seg><seg type="columnLine">another for several hours, they came upon a gulch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had at one time been a water course and now led</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in a gradual slope to the plain. Here the geologi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal and mineralogical formations held their attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they were soon engrossed in the study of specimens.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unknown to them, this was the habitual path used by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tyranosaurus when going down to the plain. The forces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Fate had gathered and were soon to strike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tyranosaurus Rex, coming down the canyon with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual easy caution, came suddenly upon the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures he had seen the day before. He was undis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered, so he stopped and watched them, his unwink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, jet eyes and cruel, hideously-armed mouth giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">no expression at all to his face. He had come upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them at an abrupt turn in the canyon and only his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">was visible, the remainder of his body was hidden by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moss-covered rock. From here, his great body held</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense and rigid, he watched them "with that crouching,</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter, motionless gaze," which only reptiles can assume.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The afternoon had almost gone, the sun was approach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the distant, unbroken horizon and the long beams</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sunlight were feeling their way up the tree shaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">canyon, which opened into the west, when the lunarians</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to start back to the car. And then Fate struck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A LUNARIAN, preparing to leave, looked up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rock he had been studying and stared straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the grim glare of the gigantic saurian. For per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps a minute he stared motionless, one limb out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched for an instrument and half bent over. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the moment before the blow fell and the forest, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, the whole universe seemed held in breathless sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pense. Then, with a peculiar, chattering cry, he sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">upright, seized a strangely formed apparatus from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle and worked the tentacles on the end of his limb</seg><seg type="columnLine">convulsively over it. With a rasping hiss, a dark red</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream, which ceased almost as suddenly as it began,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang from one end of the instrument and flickered</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly over a portion of the saurian's throat, leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind it a deep gash from which the blood flowed slug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gishly. At the sound of the cry the lunarians faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">about just in time to see Tyranosaurus, bleeding at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat and hissing terribly, spring from behind the turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the canyon some distance away. They saw with</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror the tremendous power expressed in every line of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the great beast and with one accord began retreating</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly down the gorge. This retreat changed imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately into swift flight as Tyranosaurus sprang in</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was hopeless from the start, the monstrous leaps of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saurian far surpassed in speed anything they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought could be possible to lesser living creatures. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon stopped running, therefore, and faced the charging</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant, their one thought being to save the life of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inventor, at any cost to their own. Though the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaks from the lunarian weapons seared his body con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly, Tyranosaurus Rex did not once hesitate from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fearful charge down the canyon and, unknowingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fate of humanity to come hung upon his ability to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach and wipe out his enemies. If he failed, if he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed, and the lunarians escaped, they would overrun</seg><seg type="columnLine">' the world and preclude forever the development of man</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the earth. But nothing could stop that irresistible</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge, Suddenly he was among them, striking and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripping with all four feet. In the first second, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy tail crushed the life from two and the death of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others soon followed, until there remained only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inventor, backed against the canyon wall. Tyranosaurus</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood, breathing heavily, in the center, eyeing him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">saurian had not escaped unscathed from his attack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood ran from wounds all over his body and one fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg hung limp and useless at his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For only a second did he pause and then sprang full</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the lunarian. Even as he left the ground, a red</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream played momentarily upon his body but could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not stop him from his purpose. He struck beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inventor. One huge foreleg delivered a fearful blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the lunarian lay stretched upon the rock floor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ancient water course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A flashing movement, a second of time, and the work</seg><seg type="columnLine">of uncountable centuries, of unnumbered millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, was gone for naught, as though it had never been.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why had life originated upon the moon, why had it</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled up from simplicity to complexity, from ignor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance to brilliant knowledge, if it were only to be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed in the end by a giant inhabitant of the earth?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Such is life always, seemingly without purpose, aimless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">incomprehensible and playing a game it cannot hope to</seg><seg type="columnLine">win. Extinction is the only end for any species; thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">went the great amphibians on earth, giving place to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinosaurs who also, after millions of years' develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, disappeared and were replaced by the mammals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Tyranosaurus gave the death stroke, he swayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a second after the lunarian fell, his slayer sank be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side him. A few lunarians stirred and twitched but</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally, except for the sobbing breath of the dying dino-</seg><seg type="columnLine">saur, all was stilt. Tyranosaurus lay, as did the still-</seg><seg type="columnLine">living inventor, facing the west, and both could look out</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the unbroken plains to the western sky. The great,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tawny sun was just sinking behind the wavering grass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lands and its level rays reached far across the plain's</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor and up the canyon, bathing all in a solemn, ethereal</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow. High above them in the broken canopy of multi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored trees and giant ferns ah easy, roaming wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighed and rustled, now and then exposing a patch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue sky. From far away, across the still bosoms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dreaming lakes, drifted a weird, throbbing cry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DEATH OF THE MOON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1029</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a cry as sorrowful, as mysterious as age-old life itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sinking sun bathed the saurian's grim visage in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft, warm light and as he gazed into the last sunset he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would ever see, across far spaces into the mellow glory</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Li l'e-giver, Tyranosaurus' eyes softened and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was vested with a dim, far-away dignity as one whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose is accomplished. Gradually the harsh sobbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">diminished and finally ceased and Tyranosaurus Rex,</seg><seg type="columnLine">King of the Giant Lizards, most terrible of all carni-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">vores, and most feared, had gone forever from earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun was gone.

From his reading of forgotten books he un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstood pretty well the conditions which had brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the mono-sexual world in which he lived. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous release of feminine energy in the twentieth</seg><seg type="columnLine">to thirtieth centuries, due to the increased life span</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the fact that the world had been populated to such</seg><seg type="columnLine">an extent that women no longer were required to spend</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of their time bearing children, had resulted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">more and more usurpation by women of what had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered purely masculine endeavors and the proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupations of the male sex.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Gradually, and without organized resistance from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"stronger" sex, women, with their unused, super-abun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dant energy, had taken over the work of the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gradually, complacent, lazy and decadent man had con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fined his activities to war and sports, thinking these the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only worth-while things in life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then, almost over night, it seemed, although in reality</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had taken long ages, war became an impossibility,</seg><seg type="columnLine">due to the unity of the nations of the earth, and sports</seg><seg type="columnLine">were entered into and conquered by the ever-invading</seg><seg type="columnLine">females.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER that the rest of the pitiful story was simple.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The useless ornamental males began to be treated</seg><seg type="columnLine">in much the same fashion in which the worker bees treat</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drones. Having lost the mastery of the world, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men found themselves helpless and in the way.

M-l recalled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a thrill the tales of those last battles.

The legislature, recognizing their oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity, supported the popular fury, and proceeded to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">systematic slaughter of males, until, with the help of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the regular troops, it was found practicable to protect</seg><seg type="columnLine">and preserve a small nucleus for next year's fertiliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oddly enough M-l admired the neatness and dispatch</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which his kind had been wiped out.

Life was complete, vibrant!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The millenium was at hand, and he was the only dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cordant factor.	*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But somehow, he was dissatisfied, nervous, excited.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Catching up a warm robe--for the long nights, caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the gradual slowing down of the earth's rotation</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the ages, were as icy as the days were sultry--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wrapped it about him and started pacing the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridor again toward the observation cage. Something at</seg><seg type="columnLine">variance with his environment stirred within him, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew not what. Some urge of the summer which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not drive away. The world was perfect. Yet he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a note of misery which sickened him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAST MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1033</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He remembered the dull, work-besotted faces of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">for whom he posed once every ten days. There was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the joy among them that should be expected in a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect world--the joy that the old, old books of poetry</seg><seg type="columnLine">and love, which he had deciphered, indicated the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be full of. What was wrong?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His steps muffled by the thick dust, he stumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, finally emerging into the glass cage where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had spent the day, to stand staring hopelessly at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars. For the first time he had a feeling that things</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not well; that life had become shamefully muddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Shaking himself out of his lethargy, he glanced about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him--at the city which glittered not far off, its lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashing like the signals of fairyland--at the dreaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, now revived from the universal weariness--at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">half moon just peeping over the horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he felt that he was not alone. Glancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply over his shoulder, he fancied that he saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark shape take form among the trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, winging its way through the impenetrable</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass of the cage, came a voice, clear and musical; un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the dead accents which he had become accustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to from his keepers and from occasional curious celeb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In his astonishment he forgot the purport of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">words--if they were words--for the message seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring inside his head rather than in his ears. Like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash he realized that the person outside was using</seg><seg type="columnLine">telepathy, that mythical art supposedly lost since almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dawn of history.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Who are you?" Like a knife thrust the query</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed into his consciousness through the soundproof</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As in a dream he felt the segments of his brain click</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a long-forgotten connection to reply in kind : "M-l,</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Last Man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The figure outside approached the cage and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim moonlight he stared in wonder. Hair red as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumberous fire--eyes blue as the heavens--a face fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the dream faces which sometimes tortured him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Unconsciously, true to his training, he recoiled. "An</seg><seg type="columnLine">atavist!" he gasped, "A throwback! How did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She laughed, and though he could not hear the fairy</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound, he saw the back thrown head, the rounded throat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laughing eyes. "The keepers are so dumb," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered. "It is so easy to be free. Why don't you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">join me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He shivered as at a sacrilege.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't talk so," he protested. "It would mean your</seg><seg type="columnLine">death if the keepers heard. It is wicked."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again she laughed and this time tossed one milk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">white arm against the moon. "Nothing is wicked,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the message. "And their dead minds are too dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">to understand. Come out and dance in the moonlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a splendid instant he had the impulse to seize a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair and smash his prison of glass, but lifelong in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hibitions were too strong. A wave of horror and loath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing seized him. "Go away, demon," he gasped. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are a rebel. I shall warn the guard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Unafraid she wrinkled her nose at him, then wrap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping about her a long black robe which but half con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cealed her deep breasts and the forgotten womanly</seg><seg type="columnLine">grace of her carriage, she whispered. "Another time,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and vanished among the shadows of the park.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRIGHTENED, horrified, yet fascinated as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a devil, he stood staring after her for a long mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment before he fled back down the protecting corridor</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his room as if he were pursued by a ghost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For long hours he sat at Jiis desk staring into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows which the light did not dispel. Well he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was his duty to report an atavist at large. Well</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew the havoc they had wrought in the past by</seg><seg type="columnLine">waking uprisings against the established order, by fan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning dying sparks of revolt into short-lived conflagra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, with their talk of beauty and love--and liberty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But that was long ago, while there were still men, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though a dwindling minority.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now he was the last man. The call was to him. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">witch like those in the old, old stories, was lying in</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fell into a fitful slumber, but was beset by</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams--strange,-mad dreams of beauty and soft arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flashing limbs which brought him to his feet in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat of agony a dozen times during the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old WA 10 NA 56, whom in defiance of the rules</seg><seg type="columnLine">'he always called Wana, found him, dishevelled and fev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erish, when she brought the morning meal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What's the trouble ?" she queried anxiously, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">position of warden to the last man had its responsibil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ities. "Are you ill ? Shall I call a physician ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he snapped. "I need a change, Wana, that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. Let's drive to the seashore for a day. This place</seg><seg type="columnLine">chokes me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," she grumbled. "Though what good you</seg><seg type="columnLine">get out of sitting and staring at the waves I can't un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstand. Nobody else does it. But you're a freak,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in spite of her surliness, a wisp of pathos crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the last words and her face, which looked as if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul had been eroded from it long ago, assumed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">haunted expression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A car was brought round and they clambered in--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wana dressed in nothing at all. for with the passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sex the need for clothing had ceased to exist, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man swathed in a long, black robe, such as those</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to cover the infirmities of the aged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Through the wide, straight boulevards, flanked on</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side by glistening skyscrapers of surpassing</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty, they drove at breathless speed. Everything was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean with a dazzling, agonizing cleanness which made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the senses reel. He longed, before they had driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">half an hour, for the forgotten dust and gloom of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">museum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There, there was no traffic jam. no noise, no hurry--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but only a dogged, persistent energy that was capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of moving mountains, but knew not where to move</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Through, the sides of the plate glass edifices of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the metropolis, he caught glimpses of myriads of</seg><seg type="columnLine">workers, toiling frantically in perfectly hygienic sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roundings, soaked in the health-giving ultra-violet rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sun, which the crystal walls admitted in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">1034</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">full power. He found himself panting for breath like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a runner in a nightmare, and cursed his stupidity in</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowing himself always to be thus affected when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was taken through the manufacturing district.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last they passed between two thousand foot high</seg><seg type="columnLine">structures and emerged abruptly into the open country.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were no suburbs, no encircling truck farms. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">city ended with the abruptness of a thunderclap, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">towered behind them like a heap of diamonds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wana pushed forward a silver handle. A rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor in the rear of-the car began coughing gently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The machine rose into the air and shot, at tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, over the deserted countryside. Then, under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skilful guidance of the driver it settled to the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a sunny, tree-covered knoll near the seashore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On all sides stretched unutterable desolation, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">race long ago had abandoned the unprofitable tilling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soil, and now resorted solely to the converting of</seg><seg type="columnLine">inorganic into organic matter for food. The country-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side round about was as wild and abandoned as in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten days when Sir Walter Raleigh first stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashore there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Never straying from under the watchful eye of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper, M-l strolled about the beach or swam in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm waters of the Atlantic. He had tossed aside his</seg><seg type="columnLine">disguising robe, now that there were no spectators, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">relieved from the tension of the city, romped in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm sunshine like a child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At noon he swallowed some food pills and, tired by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his morning's exercise,, went to sleep under a massive</seg><seg type="columnLine">oak tree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE awakened by a sibilant hissing close beside him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Looking up, he beheld the girl he had met in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlight the night before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shh!" she cautioned.

The idea, not entirely new, interested him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they rushed homeward through the evening sky.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was it possible to live as the birds and animals did?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was fascinated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, as if in answer to his query, an awful stom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ach-ache gripped him as his digestive track, unused to</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid nourishment, rebelled against the berries. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">writhed in agony, and knew the horror of approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissolution. Luckily Wana was in the control cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAST MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1035</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw nothing of what transpired between the two.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he did not die. The pains subsided, leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">him limp and covered with cold sweat. Was liberty</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth such a price? He wondered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DURING the next ten days he prowled in unac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">customed corners of the museum library, and, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance would have it, came upon a book entitled:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Natural Food. A Warning of its Perils." Written at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time when concentrated nourishment had been in uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versal use but a short time, this volume warned back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sliders into gourmandism, of the awful penalty which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would ensue if vegetable or animal food was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed. Unconsciously it dropped hints now and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, of the manner of preparing those odious</seg><seg type="columnLine">viands. Me read and remembered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next restday dawned and brought its usual crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">of worn toilers to stare into his crystal cage. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer envied them. He no longer hated himself. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact he was not thinking of such things. He was think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing only of the night that was coming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Forgotten was his horror of the witch girl. Sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciously his mind had made common cause with hers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were one, fighting an alien world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Darkness came at last. After consuming his nourish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, he avoided Wana, crept into the park, garbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his black robe, and waited. Almost at once a soft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong hand slipped into his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The spell works," said the well-known laughing</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. "The witch has you charmed. Did I not tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you escape was easy ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stopped and looked at each other under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon, which had just passed the zenith. A great wave</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tenderness and admiration swept over him. Awk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wardly he seized both her hands in his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're so different," he marveled. "You make me</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel queer here." He tapped his chest. "Like tears,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stumbled, "and sunshine, and flowers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She smiled, and leaning forward, gently touched her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips to his. A shock, like that from a dynamo, passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through him. He leaped back as though she had struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, then reapproached.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What was that?" he asked stupidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A kiss," she answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the long avenue of elm trees, just the Same</seg><seg type="columnLine">as those which lined parks when the world was young,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they wandered into the flood-lighted streets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They attracted little attention as they loitered along.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A few persons crossed their hands on their chests as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they passed in a sign of respect. With their cowls</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely drawn, and their slow pace, M-l and his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion were easily mistaken for the Ancients, or Law</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clivers, and so passed unquestioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For, although it was a universal rule that persons</seg><seg type="columnLine">should enter the lethal gas chambers as soon as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed the limit of usefulness--that is. when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could no longer do their twelve hours of labor daily---</seg><seg type="columnLine">exceptions were made in the case of legislators and</seg><seg type="columnLine">captains of working units, who were presumed to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain their intellectual faculties after their physical pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers had declined.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These lucky ones lived until they died natural deaths,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">but they went clothed in long black robes, to avoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakening envy in those who were doomed to die much</seg><seg type="columnLine">younger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "W'hat is your number?" M-l asked suddenly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they entered a long, roofed thoroughfare lined on both</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides with great warehouses and humming factories.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My name is Eve," she replied, smiling. "I gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to myself. I have forgotten my number."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A half-memory of some old myth stirred him. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">first woman?" he mused. "And I am the last man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strange 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt her mocking eyes upon him. "I shall call</seg><seg type="columnLine">you Adam," she said softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But that would be wrong." he objected. "Adam was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first man. wasn't he."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She merely laughed at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They turned into the portal of a vast structure which</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched for thousands of feet along the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where do we go?" he queried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is unit 1,000 of the food factory," she ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained. "I work here. Have you ever seen the inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hive?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only in pictures," he replied. "I never was allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to enter the factories."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They wandered down a long corridor, doors in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened into what seemed endless rooms humming with</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrous machinery. Here and there, however, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">room stood idle, its machines covered with dust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those engines are broken." she explained. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanics have forgotten how to fix them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They went on, through labyrinthian tunnels, under</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead bridges, and on dizzy galleries that looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on unremitting industry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Decay," she said suddenly. "Look at it, all about</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, in spite of their breathless efforts. See," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to a great mill, its screens broken and torn, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">cogs rusted from centuries of disuse. "The world is</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying. Soon--in a few thousand years, perhaps, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">this almost perfect machinery crumbles yet more--it</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be dead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you and I will be dead, too," he said bitterly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the world will be given over to the animals</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the birds and the insects. Oh. the pity of it. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">living tomb!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I thought the world had attained perfection,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he puzzled; "that all the great secrets of life had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">attained: that life purred gently, like a perfect ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So they say," she replied, "to hide the horror of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing. But the machine is not eternal, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have forgotten so much, so much!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PASSING into the street once more they stepped on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the rapidly moving surface platforms which</seg><seg type="columnLine">long ago had supplanted the clumsy street cars and</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevateds, and sped, at breakneck pace, through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart of the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where to now?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the birth factory," she answered nonchalantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gasped and something of his old fear of her re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you dare not," he cried, clutching her arm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1036</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Remember the law reads: 'No atavist, on pain of death,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall enter the precincts of the birth factory.' "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She laughed gayly. "We shall not be discovered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remember, they have forgotten so much.--You have</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen pictures of the place?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Remember the dome?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well there is a little gallery half way up it.

We shall not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be discovered."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stopped in front of a magnificent building, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">of glass but of marble. It was without adornment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful as a naked sword blade. Unlike the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings of the city, it was detached from the crystal</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof that capped all the streets, and stood alone in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little park.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before its portals paced a strong guard, heavily</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed, strangely enough, with weapons closely resem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling those used in the last wars. Rifles and automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolvers were the only mobile killing machines known,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for progress in that direction, as in all others, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped long ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come," Eve directed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They skirted the building under the watchful eye of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guard and entered a warehouse half a block away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through a long series of storerooms, which were de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted at that late hour, she led him, finally to stop in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of a blank wall. Drawing a pitch pipe from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">robe, she blew three soft notes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you want?" said a hollow, mechanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice above their heads. Adam (for we shall call him</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus hereafter) cowered in terror at this new develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, but the girl replied slo-wly and distinctly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "10, 42, 2, 74."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly, ponderously, a panel in the wall swung back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They stepped into a tiny hall. The door closed behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A clever safe combination," she smiled. "I hope it</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't wear out while we're in here. It hasn't been</seg><seg type="columnLine">cared for in ages. Wonderful artificers these ancients</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They climbed endless narrow stairs after passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">through what must have been a subterranean gallery</seg><seg type="columnLine">connecting the warehouse with the birth factory, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last emerged upon the tiny balcony she had spoken</seg><seg type="columnLine">of. They looked down. Far below in the middle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vast hall pulsed six amber globes of light, arranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a great globe of crystal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The central globe, he knew, was filled with germ</seg><seg type="columnLine">plasm from which reservoir the human race was per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petuated. From it flowed the eternal stream of life</seg><seg type="columnLine">which turned the wheels and manned the factories the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The system, in its essentials, had been discovered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the twentieth century when a surgeon had placed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit of tissue from the heart of a chicken in a sterile</seg><seg type="columnLine">medium, fed it carefully, and kept it in an ideal en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vironment. He and his successors had watched that</seg><seg type="columnLine">tissue live for a hundred years. It was growing so</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly that it had to be watched carefully and trimmed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">continually to keep it within the limits of the container.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the growing scarcity and uselessness of the males,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the antagonism of the "free women" to becoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">mothers, had grown in the old days, the legislators hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a similar scheme for perpetuating the race by</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemical means. It might have been called the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">creative work of the human mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A small quantity of germ serum was enclosed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic crystal globe under proper conditions, given</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right type of food and allowed to grow, which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">did at a tremendous rate. Then it was fertilized by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same methods, which the ancient French physicians,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alexis Carrel, Ebleing and Fische, had used to produce</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatherless frogs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This fertilized ovum, cultivated in embryonic tissue</seg><seg type="columnLine">juice, then was allowed to grow in a type of incubator</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it developed skin, bones and muscles and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to be taken to the nursery, a normal infant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TWO things the ancients had not calculated upon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however. First, they forgot that the eternally</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing germ plasm could not continue the develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the race. Every child produced in this man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner wyas on the same intellectual, spiritual and physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">level with every other child. With the development of</seg><seg type="columnLine">artificial birth the long increase in human brain capacity</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stopped short; in fact, a slow decay had set in, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the serum lost its original virility through the ages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second mistake was in creating one gigantic birth</seg><seg type="columnLine">factory instead of a number of branches. This resulted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in terrific congestion as millions of children yearly had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be started in their growth and then shipped to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant lands where their adolescence was to be spent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the old days there always had been danger of an up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising among the males to smash the plant, but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">had long since passed and the guard about the portal</seg><seg type="columnLine">was merely a formality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Adam was interrupted in his revery by the voice of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his companion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You understand, of course, why atavists are forbid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded. "Because in the dark ages they always</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to destroy the life factory."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But now it is too late for that," he continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">soberly. "Children no longer can be produced natu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rally, even if any one so desired." Then, forgetting</seg><seg type="columnLine">his oft-repeated assertion that the world was perfect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the utter blankness into which the race was drifting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept down upon him like a bank of fog and he added</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitterly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are doomed. I see it. all so clearly now. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be no more progress. There can be no more super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men to drag mankind forward in spite of its blindness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," Eve whispered, "but there are atavists to drag</seg><seg type="columnLine">mankind backward to a point where it can get a fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">start."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The idea dazzled him. "You mean--we--we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have children--and build a new, clean race?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked down, blushing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still trying to grasp the immensity of her sugges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, he turned back to the scene below. "But," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered, "we would have to stop all this--stop a!!</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAST MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1037</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this, or they would crush us by the sheer weight of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">numbers." He stared at the softly glowing container</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">below with a new and bitter loathing. Instead of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cradle 'of mankind, it suddenly had become a race's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">prison house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Unwittingly he had leaned farther and farther over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the railing of the balcony. Now, without warning, its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ancient moorings parted and a large section of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">balustrade tottered slowly outward and fell!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He heard a shriek behind him, felt his robe caught</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">-	as he reeled on the edge and was jerked backward to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">safety of the balcony. Unable to tear his gaze from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the falling railing, he stared aghast. Would it strike</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the precious globe and shatter it? Would it? Would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">■ it? But the mass of twisted metal fell to one side,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crushing one of the many guards below into a horrid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pulp of blood and brains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   For a moment there was stunned silence in the hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then a babble of shrill voices arose, and a battery of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spectacled eyes turned toward the two who clung to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their perch on the balcony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Atavists! Atavists! Man the doors! Open fire!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Guard the crystal!" shouted a captain of the guards,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">, waving her arms in strangely ant-like gestures. Adam</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">found time to marvel at the ineffectiveness of it all;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the foreshorfened figures scurrying about below; at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their feeble shouts; at his impotence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  An explosive rifle bullet which tore a hole as big</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as a barrel in the wall beside him, brought him to his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">senses but, unmindful of his danger, he crouched at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the floor and stared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Bedlam had broken loose as guards strove to draw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">an armor plate cover over the precious globe of life</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">serum. Shouts, shrieks, prayers, mingled to make a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sound strangely like that of pigs squealing. For it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">must be understood that the people worshipped the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crystal as their only god. It was the giver of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Long ago they had discarded all idea of personal im-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mortality. but the dream of immortality for the race</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through the germ plasm still persisted, and the human</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bees sprang into battle formation, as ready to sting to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">death anything, any person that attacked their life</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stream, as a real swarm of bees is to fight for its queen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Adam was shaken out of dazed horror by his compan-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ion. "Quick," she screamed. All her gaiety vanished--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her fair face drawn into a.mask of fear. "The stairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It is the only way.

Winding, twisting, dodging through piles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery, bales of goods, past unknown bruising, lurk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, inanimate objects, which seemed designed to beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">out their brains, they finally saw a flood-lighted street</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A bolt of dark cloth caught his eye as they raced</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the entrance. "Here," he gasped, tearing off two</seg><seg type="columnLine">lengths. "Wrap this around you as a cloak. We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">make it yet. The alarm has not spread this way.

"They never can</seg><seg type="columnLine">find you in the museum. Probably they'll never think</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look. And if they do I know every nook and hiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. Hurry!

Wasting no time, he dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">her through the museum entrance, hid her behind a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of bones that once might have been the skeleton</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a mastodon, and, divesting himself of his robe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw himself on his couch and lay as though asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And not a moment too soon. The alarms were work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at last. Loud, raucous and shrill, they blared</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout the city the news of the outrage.

When you hear the explosion, overpower</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wana instantly and drive to the entrance of the ware-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. Can you do that?" he queried, noticing her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sagging shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She straightened quickly and the tired lines left her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. "Yes," she nodded. "Wana is old and I am yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The final arrangements were quickly made.

Evading the watchwoman, he started</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounting the many flights of unused stairs toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof spaces. His heart pounded under the unused ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ertion, but he persisted, resting at landing after land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he had hoped, the door to the roof was unlocked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He pushed it open and crept out upon the city's glassy</seg><seg type="columnLine">shield, which extended for miles in all directions, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was broken only by the tops of the greatest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystal skyscrapers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A heavy rain was falling.

He tried the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">door of the warehouse in which lay the secret passage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was locked. The legislature was taking no chances</seg><seg type="columnLine">with roaming atavists. In fact, he knew that several</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred female retrogrades had been killed since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling of the balustrade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> -In desperation lie hammered upon the door with</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched lists. Perhaps someone would investigate. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">held his ear to the jamb. Footsteps approached from</seg><seg type="columnLine">within. It was a lower level guard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who's there," came the challenge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''One of the roof guard," he replied in feigned ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citement. "There's an atavist at large on the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">spaces. I need help."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quickly he laid the canister 011 the roof and crouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the door. Would the ruse work?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unsuspecting, the dull-witted guard turned the lock</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stepped upon the roof. He flung himself upon her</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fury before she realized the situation. Pinioning</seg><seg type="columnLine">her arms so that she could not reach her weapons, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled her to the roof. Her head struck sharply against</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grating. Her struggles ceased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snatching the canister, he leaped inside and locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. He would have to chance her reviving and</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning the real roof guard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not daring to use the elevators, he raced down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs, just escaping disastrous falls more than once.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By a miracle, he missed the other guards and at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood before the panel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shielding the noise as much as possible, he blew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistle and gave the combination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door swung open and closed behind him. Safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last he stood again upon the balcony. Below,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room seemed filled with armed soldiers. A rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladder dangled from the ledge to the floor hundreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet below. Not five feet in front of him, drowsing</seg><seg type="columnLine">over her rifle, stood a guard. The secret had been dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered. A second perhaps and she would turn !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tearing the T.N.T. from his back, he hurled it at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steel armor which still covered the life globe below</seg><seg type="columnLine">and said a swift prayer to a forgotten God.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Things happened with amazing swiftness and clarity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The guard in front had heard him. She whirled, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle at ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN--there was nothing. He felt himself drift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in a world without sound or light. At peace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hours afterward, it seemed, an agonizing pain awak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened him into consciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He peered into blackness--a soundless, still opacity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A wild desire to scream came over him.

Remembering his flashlight, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to find it in the pocket of his robe, only to dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cover that the robe was gone and that his right afS</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangled uselessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With his sound arm he felt about him. Two feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the balcony his hand descended into space. Back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him the wall had a jagged rent extending as far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could reach. The truth of the situation dawned</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him. The explosion had been so terrific as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tear away all of the balcony, except a tiny projection</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon which he lay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fearfully he felt his way along this. Was his escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut off ? Pie touched the edges of the doorway. Safe!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unable to stand, he crept down the stairs on hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees. Half of the steps seemed missing. Once he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell five or six feet. But he persisted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sense of power filled him. The life serum was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, he knew. The top of the life factory dome must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been blown off by the concussion. Pie owed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life to a miracle. But he had succeeded!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was one thing more to be done. What was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that? Plis brain reeled and plunged. Escape! Es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cape ! The thought spurred his lagging senses. Down</seg><seg type="columnLine">--down--always down. One step--two--a dozen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">then a dizzy slip through darkness where the steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been torn away by the blast. On! On! Into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths of darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last he reached the portal. The pitch pipe!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where was it? Gone, with his robe and the flash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Drawing himself together he tried to remember the</seg><seg type="columnLine">notes. Were they C, D and A, or S, D and F. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistled the latter as nearly in the tone of the pipe as</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In reply came merely a jumbled whirring, clicking</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound. He tried again--C. D and F. This time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirring was a little clearer and he fancied he heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blurred corpse of the word "Want."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "10--42--2--74," he answered ; then held his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A jarring sound of dislocated machinery was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only answer. The door remained closed!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frantically he hurled himself against it. With the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden strength of a maniac he beat upon the edge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It gave!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly, grinding and jarring, it swung open--an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch--two--six. There it stuck. He forced his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der through the aperture. Still more it gave. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">again! Push! It swung wide open and he fell faint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the floor outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another interval. Then an' insistent voice seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">calling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are you. Adam?"

It always gives me a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stimulus to see an abstruse metaphysical speculation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--the abstraction of formality garbed with the in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nervating robes of imagery. Predatory scientists</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in their avid quest fcr brilliantly immutable facts</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">exhibit a slant towards mental fixation. It is just</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this geometrical rigidity, that is a Janus. While it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">appeals to the technician and to the philosophic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pundit who loves perfection more than life, whose</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vocation is speculation, to the average human being</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it holds little attraction save perhaps as the magni-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tude or incredibility of the fact awakens a parallel</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">response in the homo sapiens' construction. Since</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the normal human being prefers his data of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">external world in romantically inconsistent version,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it is &lt; xtremely essential that fictions shall be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">created about facts in pleasantly possible situa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tions. Man experiences vicariously the emotions</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the literary creations he is reading about; for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that reason fictions of novel expository import</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">serve to elevate the creature of free will within the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">confines of mechanism from the sordid level of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sen.se experience and humdrum routine. Incon-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sistency therefore enlivens life; preventing extreme</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">intellectual specialization which would inevitably</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">end in automatism, thus robbing the one so afflicted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of his own individuality. The author of "The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Menace of Mars," however, has yet a long and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">arduous, trail to relative, metaphysical perfection;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in this she has my wishes for the success of her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">venture, if the inconsequential efforts of one so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">addicted may accelerate her progress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The story evidences a curious admixture of ob-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">jective dispassionateness and a specious sophistry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I say this not with an arrogated omniscience but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">merely as a self-evident analysis. It is objectively</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">analytic inasmuch as it excludes human prejudice,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">even in the story's context, but paradoxically enough</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when the author is well within the outer fortifica-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tions of depersonalized synthesis, she foolishly falls</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a victim to a common error of the popular mind,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that of anthropomorphism, investing the inhabi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">• tants of the ]Vfartian planet with the attributes of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man, a highly emotional and malevolent one at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that. The basic philosophy of the story, though</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">probably not easily perceptible to a superficial</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scrutinizing, is the jaded husk of mechanism in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">its most rudimentary form. The story is thus</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">an atavism to which the author has recourse for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">no apparent reason, when there are so many logical</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">systems that could have been annexed with no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">extra expenditure of energy. Radiant energy, ac-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cording to the author, is the end and cause of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">everything--of course, obviously this is a malignant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">world, obviously human beings are only excres-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cences not at all teleological agents, obviously</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">since there is theoretically such a thing as friction-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">less action, there must be some universal end,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which is an all inclusive realization of all poten-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tiality, which even infinitesimal electrons frolicking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">erratically through an enormous inter-play of energy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are striving toward as a common aim--manifestly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it is so--didn't the author pre-suppose it? Even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">assuming that radiant energy was the basis of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all existence and a universal harmonic synthesis</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the ultimate aim--where did radiant energy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">receive its primal impulse? Science doesn't pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fess to know, the religionist pushing back the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">skein of logic one more step offers God as the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">creator of all but yet there remains unanswered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the insistent query, who or what created God?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Did He exist since the beginning, is time non-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">existent fcr Him, or is lie identical with tbe toy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the enamored metaphysicist, the Absolute?

Now,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">since I have pointed out that which I believe to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be manifest concerning Mrs. Harris' charming tale,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she will readily perceive that metaphysics should</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be treated by an individual of the trade; perhaps</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she unconsciously transgressed the limits of scienti-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fiction.

Some of the papers spoke of it as the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic hoax ever attempted, but a few took it as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact and soberly declared that it opened up unheard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of possibilities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The fact that Guros Julio was to attempt to com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">municate mentally was of interest to all, and several</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists came posthaste to my observatory to see if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attempt would be a success. I had no way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing, at that time, on just what day the headlines</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared in the German papers, as there was little com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munication on account of the war, so every afternoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">after it was given to the world, we met in the observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory before three o'clock and waited patiently for some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to come. It was the third day after the news had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been published in the American papers, and quite a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little group was in the observatory. As I remember it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were Professor Simplon of Washington, Profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sor Davidsky of Petrograd, Professor Hartbeest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">South Africa and a half dozen reporters. The profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sors of the foreign universities happened to be in Bos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton at the time the find was published, and came right</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to see for themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several mind-readers and clairvoyants wanted to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">there also, but I had denied them that privilege.

Everyone was tensed for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible message from Guros Julio. I doubted if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could communicate with the carth-mind, and most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them agreed with me. But Professor Margehtes was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that he would find a way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"He is here! He is here!" suddenly cried Margehtes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All eyes were on Margehtes as he began to speak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Guros Julio, you are here and I feel your pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence. We thank you for the message from Memos."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Margehtes was not alone in the reception of the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply, for I, too, got the mind message from Guros Julio.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you for your faith in me." was imprinted on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind as clearly as if the words had been spoken.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Teach the conditions on Memos wherever you can.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	will return in the mind later."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was all. but it showed that mental communica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion could be had with Guros Julio. Profes'sor Davidsky</seg><seg type="columnLine">got a part of the message and was convinced of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth of the tale, as were nearly all the others. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">now trying to study concentration, in order that I may</seg><seg type="columnLine">freely communicate with Guros Julio when next he</seg><seg type="columnLine">visits my observatory. I am in hopes that I can per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect myself in this so that I can learn the secrets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machines of Memos and give those secrets to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world.

Some of them are good scientifiction while</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> others arc not. As to the stories themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Among the outstanding stories published by you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> arc: "Columbus of Space," "Skylark of Space."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Island of Dr. Moreau," "Station X," and others</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of such ilk. Those that did not strike me as well</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> written scientifiction are "A Story of Days to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Come," (too dry and full of detail). There arc</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> many scientific mistakes in "The Invisible Man,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> by H. G. Wells. Here is one. If our friend was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> able to make invisible a piece of linen, then why,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> when he has made himself invisible, cannot be per-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> form the same feat upon his clothes? It is not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> up to me to criticize stories of the poor type, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> those of the good type. The "Menace of Mars"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> is very well written, but I must disagree with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> author (as well as Mr. Gernsback) on the theory</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> about which the story is written. We (not the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jaymen) are all familiar with the electronic theory,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> no doubt. But, when one attempts to claim that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the earth may be an electron of an atom of a gas,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> liquid, or solid, that is another matter. It is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> known that the nucleus of an atom is composed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of protons and electrons in varying degrees while</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the element is determined by the number of elec-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> trons that revolve about this nucleus. As far as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I can see, I cannot understand how one can con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> sider our solar system as a larger atom. Surely,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> if we consider the sun as a proton and its planets</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> as electrons, you cannot make me believe that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> protons have an orbital path around the nucleus, for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the electrons certainly counterbalance the proton</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> within the nucleus. If it can be shown that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> solar system can be considered as a cosmic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> atom, then will I believe; until then, I'm from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Missouri. The facts are against it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Nothing much can be said about "To the Moon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by Proxy," except that it is well written and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">contains excellent science. "Reprisal" may have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been well written but does not meet with my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">approval. The only thing mentioned there that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">might be scientific is his explanation of the diverted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gulf stream. The same applies to "The Voyage</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to Kemptonia." The only scicntific thing is his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mention of the new or extra-terrestrial body.

I find</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the letters from your readers most interesting, for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> they show what a wide range of tastes prevails</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> among the patrons of Amazing Stories.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   First, I want to say that your cover designs are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> original, striking, usually artistic and just what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> your magazine needs to attract new readers. With</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the newsstands so cluttered up today with Sexy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stories, Smutty Stories, Western Stories, War</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stories, and the like, the contents of which are as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> alike as peas in a pod, it is nccessary for a maga-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> zine of the type of Amzing Stories to have a cover</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> design that gives the prospective buyer an immedi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ate idea of its contents. I well remember, it was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the cover design that led me to buy my first copy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of Amazing Stories. Had it not been for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> picture on the cover, I would have passed it up as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "just another one of those magazines" and so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> missed some delightful hours spent in the perusal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of your pages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Now as to the type of stories I prefer (assum-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ing that you are interested). First, interplanetary</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> stories; they have always had the greatest fascina-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tion for me. I can read them for hours and not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tire of them. Second, stories of the fourth dimen-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> sion and stories of advanced science; also stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of the future.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   There is just one fault I have to find with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> your stories, and that is only with some of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> them. Yours is a scientific magazine, and there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> are hundreds of magazines catering to the roman-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tic type. Why do your writers write a perfectly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> fascinating interplanetary or futuristic story, scien-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tifically correct in every detail, and then throw in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a girl, usually named Ooomlag, or Poo-bah or Sook-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> sook, or some such juvenile name, who falls in love</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> with the earth hero and docs most unconvincing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> things to show her love; usually getting killed at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> end of the story. Cease the bloodshed, let the poor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oomlags, Poobahs and Sook-sooks stay out of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> story altogether. The people who read your mag-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> azine,-arc, I believe, more interested in the unusual</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> features of the story, than in a certainly mediocre</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> love plot thrown in, as a cook at the last minute</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> throws in a piece of onion to make the stew more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tasty. It is quite possible I am wrong, many peo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ple have to have some mushy stuff in everything</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> they read, even if it's the Congressional Record.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Nojf. that is the only kick I have to register</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> against your very excellent magazine and most likely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> that kick is out of order. So please retain your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> artist Paul and tell him to make his cover designs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> as striking as he pleases, and don't be stingy about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> illustrating the stories.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                      F.

The mere fact that there is so much to be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> shown on each cover, apparatus, and general de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tails along with the personnel of the story, makes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the picture rather full, and sometimes what an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> artist would call "a rather big spot of color," and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> we believe that this unavoidable character is what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> has awakened some unmeaning criticisms.

"What do you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> read that imaginative trash and bunkum for--what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> good is it ?*' I have even seen people on the buses</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> look at a copy under my arm and openly give me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a pitying look.

I think they are excellent, but their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> efforts arc merely a little too brilliant.)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   By all means let us have the pleasure of read-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ing some more stories by Murray Leinster and &lt;1.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McLeod Winsor--I think that the latter's "Station</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> X" was the best story you have ever published.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with "The Land that Time Forgot......I'he Color</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out of Space," and "Treasures of Tantalus" elose &lt;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> behind it. I have also much praise to offer your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> doctor-authors, Drs. Keller &amp; Brener, and Mr. Bob</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Olsen for his plausible explanation that the fourth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> dimension could exist, in "Fourth Dimensional Sur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> gery."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I am much in favor of having the Quarterly--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">perhaps in time Amazing Stories will be a semi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">monthly magazine. Do you intend to publish another</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">annual this summer, or have I missed it?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The comments of so many readers on the theory</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that "time" is or is not the fourth dimension amuse</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me greatly. Although T agree with H. G. Wells</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when he says that an "instantaneous cube" could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have no real existence, nevertheless I would rather</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">take the viewpoint of Bob Olsen in "Four Dimen-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sional Surgery."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   If one is going to start adding other "dimensions"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to the linear ones, why not group all the linear di-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> mensions under the one word "position?" Then the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> other necessary "dimensions" could possibly be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> taken as "time" and "mass." For example: an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> object such as a chair could not exist without being</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> located in some one place: it could not exist with-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> out a definite size and weight, nor could it exist if</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> it had no time of existence--that is, if it never ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> isted. I realize that I have mixed up my meaning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of mass by putting in the words size and weight--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> it would have l&gt;een simpler to just say mass. Of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> course, I am not saying that this is my "pet"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> theory--it is merely my way of showing that it is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> hard to say which are "dimensions" and which are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   In your editorial comment on Mr. L. A. Maple's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> letter in the September issue, you quote something</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> from Prof. Boor's "Gravitation vs. Relativity"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> which I question. ". . . as the speed of my room</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> increased, my desk clock would run more and more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> slowly, each tick would represent the passing of an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> hour or a day ... of our ordinary earthly time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> • . . at the end of half an hour by my clock, I would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> have traversed the depths of space and returned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> home . . ." Prof. Poor then goes on to say that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> he would find that time on the earth had progressed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> several centuries while it was only a half hour to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> him. Now, the ordinary span of human life is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> somewhat less than 100 years--why then would he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> not die of old age during his "half hour trip?" On</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the other hand, if he in some manner managed to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> prolong bis life and did return to the earth after</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> several centuries, surely the effects of traveling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> through space must have slightly injured his clock,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> as it only registered a half hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I realize, of course, that if what Mr. Einstein</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> says is true, that time varies with motion, that an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> hour is not always an hour, then I am wrong;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> but otherwise I cannot understand it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Harry H.
