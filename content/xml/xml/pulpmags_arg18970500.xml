            <seg type="columnLine">the ground below would be saturated and soft, and that the broad wheels of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his dray would sink in it to the axles, and that his team would have to strain</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and work to the utmost to get the load across on firmer ground on to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">other side. The track went right across the flat, and the dense growth of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">timber all round utterly precluded the possibility of his making a fresh track</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to avoid it. He went on ahead and waded into the water, the soft, spongy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">character of the earth below warning him of the danger he ran of getting</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bogged if he attempted to drive his team across.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He felt the ground carefully as he splashed across the flat. The water</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">did not reach to his knees, and he did not find that his feet sank so deeply</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">into the mud as he had anticipated. Had he sunk up to his knees in the bog,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he might have been satisfied that the dray would stick ; but as he only felt</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spongy turf below his feet, he was sure that his bullocks could get the load</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">over safely. To wait where he was for the water to go off the flat was, to his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mind, only trifling with fortune.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Swinging the long handled whip with its great length of greenhide lash,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he cracked it and shouted to his team, till he had the bullocks going at a good</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pace towards the treacherous flat. The dray sank lower and lower at every</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stride of the team. Slower and slower was the progress made, until the axles</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were level with the water, and Wilton knew that nearly a quarter of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wheels were embedded in the mire.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">By that time, however, the dray was half way across the flat, and Wilton,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thinking the battle already won and feeling the effects of his continuous</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wielding of the heavy whip, allowed his team to rest. And thus he lost the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">struggle ; for as the dray stood with all the weight of the load pressing down</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">upon the wheels, it sank bit by bit, until, glancing toward it, he saw that the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">axles had disappeared beneath the water.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He started at his team, using every means known to him to make each</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bullock pull its utmost. But all in vain. Though they strained forward on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">their yokes until they sank knee deep in the bog, the dray refused to move</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">forward an inch, and at last, worn out with his exertions, he saw that dark-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ness was coming on, and that his dray was as firmly embedded as though it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had been buried. Angry at himself, his team, and everything else, Wilton</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">loosened the animals from their yokes, and hastened towards dry ground in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">search of a place to camp for the night.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The rain, which had ceased during the day, now began to fall again. His</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">food and blankets were in the dray, and as the first drops splashed around</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him when he was half way between the end of the flat and the dray, he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">turned back. He would camp under the shelter of the tarpaulin which cov-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ered the load, till the morning, and do the best he could with a nip of rum</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and some beef and damper until daylight. When he reached the wagon again</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he clambered up, and, taking off his sodden boots, w'riggied under the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tarpaulin.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">By the time he had finished his repast, darkness had taken the place of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">light, and the rain beat steadily and monotonously upon the tarpaulin. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">put the remainder of his provisions into the bag, and stretched himself out as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">much as the narrow, confined space would permit.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" Well, I'm safe here from floods, bushrangers, or blacks," he thought, as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he drew out his pipe and prepared to enjoy a smoke before sleeping. When</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his pipe was filled he lay down with his head towards the small opening</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">through which he had crept under the tarpaulin, and, with his tucker bag as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a pillow, he took out his flint and steel to strike a light for liis pipe. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">raised the steel to strike when the silence of the night was broken by a sound</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that made him lie still and fearful. It was the sound of men shouting as they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shout and halloo when they ride round a mob of cattle to "round them up."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He slid along until he had his head through the opening under the tar-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">paulin. The sounds of galloping horses came to him. He could also hear the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cries more distinctly, and he shivered as he heard them, for they were the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">loud, hoarse shouts of the white man and the shrill, keener yells of the black.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">A momentary break in the clouds allowed a stray glint of moonlight to faintly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">illumine the darkness, and before it had passed, he saw what made him feel</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">still more fearful. •</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">His bullocks were charging madly down towards the flooded flat, and sur-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rounding them were quickly moving black figures, and behind them the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">figures of men on horseback. In a flash the stories he had scouted came to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his mind. Only one class of white men traveled with the blacks, so rumor</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">said, and those were of a kind worse in every respect than their darker</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">brethren.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The transitory gleam of moonlight had passed and darkness hid the scene</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from his eyes; but the babel of sounds came to him and he knew that his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bullocks were being slain and that soon the men he had seen would be seeking</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for him. And to find him meant at best robbery, or probably death, for to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the men of his own color who were with the blacks the life of a fellow creature</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was even less than the life of a white man was to the natives. They, at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">least,i had some reason for their warfare in the annexation of their country ;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but the white outlaws had none, and so were the more relentless and the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">more bloodthirsty against every one who had not been branded with the con-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Wilton pulled the tarpaulin down closely and tucked the loose edge in as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tightly as he could, and then crept back to the farthest corner of his crevice,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dragging his tucker bag with him and wedging himself in between the bales.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then he waited, reviling himself for his folly in traveling unarmed, in</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">discovered that he could just squeeze himself into a corner where another</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">at last the desire to satisfy his curiosity and find out what they were doing</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the shimmer of the moonlight. He pushed himself further forward until his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">head was almost through the opening, and then strained his ears to catch any</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sound that might warn him, if his fears were correct, and there was any one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">beside himself on the dray. Beyond the hum of voices in the distance he heard</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The water all around him was glittering in the moonlight as it rippled in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the light breeze which was blowing. He glanced across to where he had seen</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the black figures chasing his bullocks. Three or four large fires were blazing,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and the light from the flames helped the moon in making the immediate sur-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and the blacks were holding high revel, and were feasting as only blacks</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">know how to feast. He had learned enough of their habits to know that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">while anything was left to eat the natives would gorge, and that nothing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would draw them away from the feast but a hostile attack from another tribe.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">But the discovery of his loss and the practical ruination it meant to him wras</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">had while the blacks were reveling in gluttony. He could only lie still and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">impotently watch the scene before him and rage at his helplessness either to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">As he lay watching, he saw twro men, whose clothes suggested that they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were white, passing from one fire to the other and evidently urging the naked</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blacks to some action. They came to the fire that was nearest to the water,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and he could see them pointing to the dray. One of them stooped and picked</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">up a blazing brand from the fire, and held it out to one of the blacks, waving</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">ment at not finding the driver. Then the absurdity of the thing came to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">burn, it would be quite enough to roast him, or, at all events make his hiding</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">place so unbearable that he would have to get out of it, and, in doing so, show</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">himself to the enemy, and meet the doom he had already heard suggested.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">There was not much to choose between the chance of being half roasted and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">suffocated or speared as he ran for his life, but of the two he preferred to risk</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He glanced down at the water. It was not so very far to slide down, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">if he were once in he might be able to conceal himself in the shadow of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dray until an opportunity offered for him to wade ashore and hide himself</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">One stalwart black was standing between him and the nearest blaze, his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">When he withdrew it the end was blazing, and poising it, he sprang forward</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Forgetful of the possibility of discovery in the face of the new and unex-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">fail to strike its target, but happily the thrower had put too much strength</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">into his task, and the spear skimmed over the top of the load, and plunged,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hissing, into the water beyond.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A loud shout from the direction of the fires brought Wilton back to his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">enemies were gathered, and his heart sank.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The blacks were running about from one fire to the other, and shouting</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and yelling in a wild chorus. He felt that he had been seen, and that they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were preparing to rush out to him and take him captive, and, without waiting</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to think, he slid forward and fell into the water. In his fear and dismay he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had let himself go without considering the possibilities of his fall making a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">splash and directing the attention of the blacks to his position. Fortunately</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for liim the maimer in which he fell was the only way to avoid splashing, for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he glided under the water as silently as an otter would slip from a rock.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">As he raised his head above the surface he understood the meaning of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">activity round the fire'. All the men had seized spears, and were preparing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to hurl them, with blazing tips, at the target their fellow had overshot. Even</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as Wilton looked he saw' half a dozen of them leap forward and fling the</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">When he fell into the water he had the good sense to keep his body below</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and he was compelled to stretch himself out to keep his body under cover.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The result w'as that he wTas actually more exposed to danger from the spears</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">freely. But only for a moment. Two of the spears struck the target, and,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">plunging into the tarpaulin cover, left the fire brands, with which they had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been embellished, hissing and sputtering on the top. Once the tarred cloth</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He could not see the fires from where he stood under the shelter of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">frenzy of uncertainty as to what to do, Wilton looked around.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Gradually the moonlight faded, and glancing upwards he saw a big mass</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of clouds slowly sailing across the moon. It was his one chance to get across</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He waited until the cloud entirely obscured the moon and then started</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">terrific shout from the direction of the fires sent the blood to his heart. For-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">getful of everything save the danger of discovery, and in his fear doing the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">dripping and helpless, looking towards the place whence the noise came. At</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the same moment a ruddy light beat round him and lit up the shadows of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The horse turned towards the fires, and he hastened after it, forgetting all</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">else in his haste and anxiety to secure it. As it emerged on to the hard</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ground, he was beside it, and catching the loose bridle that hung from its head,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he sprang upon its back and urged it forward into a headlong gallop, past the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fires where the remains of his team still lay, away from the uproar and noise</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the fight into the darkness beyond, where he knew the track was that</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">tudes of the past few hours had robbed his mind of everything save the one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">paramount anxiety for escape. Gradually the sounds of the conflict became</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fainter and fainter, until at last he lost them in the noise of his horse's hoofs.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The moment he ceased to hear them a fresh fear came to him. What if the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fight were over, and the remainder of the horsemen were riding after him ?</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">For in the whirl of excitement and fear he did not stop to think that when</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he got away from the scene everybody else was far too much engaged in the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">supposing they had observed him, were one of themselves or one of the black</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He reined in his horse and turned his head in the direction whence he had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">come. The air was still and quiet, and no sound came to him to suggest that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the conflict was still in progress ; but whether it was because he had ridden</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">too far or because the battle was over, he was not able to decide. The mere</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fact, however, that he had checked his wild gallop and exerted himself to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">listen to something else than the promptings which had urged him forward in</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He was bootless and hatless, and his clothes still clung to him in their</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">that his adventures had not robbed his appetite of its existence, came the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">memory that he was without the means of satisfying it. He felt in the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">leather pouch a ttached to his belt, in which he carried his pipe and tobacco,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and found a sodden piece of the latter, but the pipe he had left in the dray.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">And it was in the dray that there was food as well, he thought rapidly, as his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mind, freed from the confusion and strain of terror, began to clear and regard</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">had come. Mounted on a good horse he might cover the distance in two</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">days under ordinary circumstances, but his experience on the flat warned him</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that the country before him was heavily flooded, so that it might be weeks</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">before he would be able to get through. And how was he to exist under</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">those conditions? Two days without, not only food, but a smoke or a fire,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was bad enough ; a week would be fatal. And there was only one way to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">avoid it, and that was to go back and see whether the enemy had departed,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">easy to escape from what at the time seemed an overwhelming danger. As</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he approached the scene of the fight, he dismounted from his horse, and,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">leading it until he found a suitable spot, he hitched the bridle to a tree and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">had gone more to the side than he believed, and when he had reached the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stretch of water that covered the flat, he was half way past it. A chance</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">opening between the trees revealed it to him, and as he crept to the edge of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Peering over the bushes towards the place where the fires had blazed the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">note any signs of life. Looking over the water he saw, here and there, dark</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spots, while over at the place where the fight had raged when he left, he could</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">make out more dark spots and the slender shafts of spears showing above the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But there was no sound and no sight of life to be seen anywhere. Moving</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with the utmost caution, he crept around the edge of the water until he was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">near enough the still smoldering fires to distinctly see what was around</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The remains of his bullocks first caught his eye, as they lay between the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fires and the water. Beyond them, away towards the bush, lay the body of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a horse, with spears sticking out all over it until it seemed to be a mammoth</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">porcupine. The fires were reduced to smoldering embers, and Wilton, em-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">boldened at the silence that was in the air, drew nearer. As he did so he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">noticed that beyond the horse the body of a man lay on the ground, and a</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He glanced quickly round. Near to where he was standing, one of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">know that it w'as the back of a dead black fellow which just rose above the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">surface of the water. Then all the others were dead black fellows, too, and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">prints of the horses' hoofs in the soft earth. They were going both to and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">were deep scars, as though the animals that made them had been madly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">charging. The dead horse had fallen in its stride, and there was the impres-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sion where its rider had struck the ground, and also the marks where he had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">slipped as he tried to clamber on to his feet before the spear, which had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">struck him in the back and pierced him so as to stick out a couple of feet</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from his chest, had been hurled at him.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" My side won after all," Wilton thought, as he stooped over the body of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his countryman. There was a pistol in the belt and a bag of ammunition,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">while on the ground between him and his horse lay the bushranger's rifle.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Wilton hastily gathered them, and carried them into the bush, where he de-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">posited them and returned to the shore opposite the dray. Prom what he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">saw., he reasoned that the fight had gone against the white men and their</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">allies, and that they had fled with the victors in full cry after them. But</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">both parties would know of the amount of food that lay round the fires, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it W'as quite impossible for a black fellow' to continue a chase very long while</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">there was such an opportunity to gorge. So he anticipated that it would not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">be long before some of them returned, and in the meantime he determined to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">get what he could.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A closer inspection of the dray revealed the fact that, although the cover-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">scorched, the load was practically uninjured. As Wilton waded up to it, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">prepared to climb into the narrow crevice where he had left his tucker bag,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his foot struck against something solid in the mud. He reached down and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">found one of his boots, and a little way off he came across the other. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pain that he had endured in his barefoot walk through the bush made the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">find the more appreciable, and when he clambered up on the dray, his first</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">act was to put the saturated articles on his bruised and cut feet. Then he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gathered his blankets and tucker bag, and having put all the provisions he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had into the latter, he waded ashore with the lot. He returned to where he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had deposited the firearms and ammunition, and taking them up, pushed on</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">After he had enjoyed, with all the avidity of semi starvation, a heavy meal</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from the contents of his tucker bag, he stretched himself out on his blankets</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">When he awakened he fancied it was just after sunset, and he arose and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">left in the darkness without the companionship of a fire. Instead, however,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the dusk growing darker it became lighter, and Wilton realized that he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had slept right on from the previous afternoon. The fire that was to have</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">kept him company during the night now served to prepare his morning meal,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and when that was finished he started to look for his horse. It had not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">strayed very far, and soon after the sun was up he had it saddled and was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">riding along the creek looking for a place where he might safely get across.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Lower down the stream widened, and, putting his horse into it, he managed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to reach the other side, though the current was so strong as. nearly to carry</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Directly they arrived at the other side the horse, of its own initiative,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Without paying any particular attention to the fact, Wilton gave it a free</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rein as he filled his pipe. He was lighting it when the horse turned in its</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">course and walked rapidly up a steep rise, over which big boulders were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">scattered. Behind one of them it again turned and stopped, and Wilton</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The meaning of the horse's action, and the significance cf the opening,</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">His first impulse was to ride away as fast as he could, but on second</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Jumping from the saddle, he fastened the bridle where he could easily</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He entered a medium sized chamber, the floor of which was smooth and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">being convinced that he would not be able to travel very much farther but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would have to camp beside some impassable stream until the waters had had</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">It was not long before he arrived at such a creek, and 011 its banks he was</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He struck cs.mp, and with nothing more serious than a good wetting he</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But that was. not, unfortunately the only creek between him and settle-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ment, and he had not ridden very many miles before he was again compelled</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to halt on the bank of a fiercely rushing stream. Striking out for a short cut</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he had come upon the creek at a place where it swerved round a projecting</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">point, the current boiling and eddying in a hundred swirls. Beyond the point</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the stream widened, and the high bank on which he stood sloped down, while</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on the opposite side the bank was high all along. He rode down slowly to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lower point to see whether there was not some means by which he could get</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">over, but it only needed a brief inspection to show him that the feat was quite</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">impossible in the face of the awkward bank on the other side. Had it shelved</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">down the same as that on which he stood, he would have swum his horse</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">over, but it would have been suicidal to attempt such a thing with a precipi-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tous bluff affording no foothold as a landing place.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He continued to ride slowly along the bank, looking for a likely spot</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">where his horse would have a chance of emerging if it managed to get through</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the current. A mile or so further along the stream again widened, and the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">banks on either side sloped down until they were little above the surface of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the water. He was debating whether to risk it or not, and glanced back at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the higher point whence he had come and where he had noticed an excellent</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">site for a camp. He just caught sight of two men, both armed with rifles,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">slipping behind the trees.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Without more ado he rode his horse straight for the stream. The animal</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shied and swerved aside at the bubbling water, but he dug his heels into its</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sides and forced it into the flood. He heard a loud cry from the top of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bank where he had seen the two men, and a rifle shot echoed through the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">his feet from the stirrups, he threw himself out of the saddle just as the horse</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stumbled forward. Still holding the bridle he tried to keep the horse's head</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from turning down stream, while both battled with the current and swam for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">their lives. In spite of their efforts they were swept along, and Wilton</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">realized that the only chance that was left for them ever to reach the shore</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">again was by keeping themselves afloat and trusting to their being carried</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">near enough to get a foothold, or into water sufficiently slack to permit them</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to make some progress.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Weighted as he was with the rifle strapped across his shoulders he already</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">felt exhausted, and the horse was snorting with fear and fatigue when the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stream narrowed and the current whirled them along like straws. He tried</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to look toward the banks past which they were rushing, but the eddies were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">so strong that he was spun round before he could do more than get a confused</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blur of high bluffs on every side. He felt a tug at the bridle, and knew that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it had been jerked from his grasp. The horse was out of sight ; he heard an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ugly roaring in his ears ; there wras a swift vision of blue sky and green</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">leaves and then a rude blow at the back of his head. Helpless, exhausted,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and nerveless, he ceased his fight and sank into dark and senseless oblivion.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Wilton was lifted for the moment off his feet. As the weight of his body</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">come on to the rope the noose drew so tight that it cut into his neck and sent</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the blood to his head. His eyes started nearly out of their sockets and his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tongue lolled out of his mouth, which he opened with the intention of crying</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for mercy, but the cord was too tight, and only a gurgling sound came. He</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">relaxed their hold of the cord, and he came to the ground again, and lay as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he fell. Giles loosened the noose enough for him to breath and then stood</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">That he was able as well as wicked was proved by the fact that neither he</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">sufficient local rain to flood them, and the fact filled the avengers' hearts with</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">towards them from the creek. They laughed harshly as they pulled the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">roughly seizing him, sent him staggering back until he tripped and fell.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">And to that fall, Wilton owed his rescue, for the trooper had stumbled over</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a rifle that one of his squatters had thrown on the ground in his haste to lend</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a hand at hauling up ^he unfortunate carrier.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the sound of a rifle shot so close to them. They started in a momentary</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">bushrangers were upon them. The bullet struck the rope as it passed over</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the branch, and the body of Wilton dropped down upon those immediately</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">who a moment before had been trying to take it. His heels struck Giles on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the forehead, tearing ugly wound and stunning him. Two others also</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shared the force of Hilton's descent, and the four lay in a confused heap to-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">His movements made the squatters recover their wits and understand the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">broke out anew. With angry shouts they turned upon the trooper. He,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The brief conversation was sufficient to turn the anger of the band, and as</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">At the time they landed, some twenty five years ago now, there were only</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about half a dozen men in the place with whom the girl could associate, and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">heart, and what was more, he succeeded where the other had failed. This</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was said to have preyed a good deal on Plover's mind, and he became seriously</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">addicted to rum, then about the only intoxicant that could be constantly ob-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tained in the place. From drink he went to other evils, and soon had about</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">gang or an inmate of the refractory prisoners' quarters. Long before he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">reached that stage in his career, the lady naturally turned her back upon</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him, and he was generally shunned by the remainder of the decent people in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the place--a proceeding which did not tend to make his mind easier or smooth</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his difficulties away. At last his conduct became so outrageous that it is said</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the governor informed him that he was free to return to England whenever</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and, of course, came face to face with his wife. She screamed and fainted,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and the convict servants rushing in, had him secure in half a minute, for they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had not forgotten their murdered mate nor the class of justice that had been</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">given to the ex-official, and what would have been given to them had they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">killed even one of themselves. News was sent to the husband, and by the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">cut and dried among the convict witnesses. Plover was sent back to jail at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">once, and when he was brought up for trial the lady was too ill to appear as a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">witness. But the servants were there, and they told so specious a tale, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bore one another out so fully, even to the smallest detail, that the judge said</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it was absurd for Plover to assert their evidence was all lies, and that for his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">part he had never heard such admirable witnesses. They all got their tickets</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of leave, and Plover five years and a flogging. The latter part was com-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">muted, at the earnest solicitation of the young officer, and Plover was sent</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">away to help make the roads into the interior. Three years later there was a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">revolt in the camp and Plover, with others, escaped.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" The young couple in Sydney had in the meantime been blessed with a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Fearing nothing of what was in store for them, the young; couple went up,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">arm in arm, to the nursery. On the floor the nurse lay, stabbed through the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Wilton listened to the story with more than interest. He had blamed</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">morse vanished, and in its place he felt a proud emulation at his own deed.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I'm not sorry I shot him," he involuntarily exclaimed.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">' ' If the authorities will accept his word as evidence that he was Plover,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it was a good stroke for you. There has been a reward out for years for him</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I wonder how you know so much about him," Farrell's comrade said.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">" That is easy enough to explain," Farrell answered with a laugh. " My</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">father was sergeant in the company that Major Pearson brought out. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">major was only a lieutenant then and the old man a corporal, and of course</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he knew all the yarn about the rivalry between his officer and Plover. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">old man's one song to me ever since I joined the police is, ' Find the major's</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" And Wilton has taken half the job out of your hands," Johnson said.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" And I'll be only too pleased if he takes the other half and disposes of it</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A few days later the band dispersed. In the mean time Johnson had gone</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">round his little circle suggesting that as Wilton had been rather roughly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">treated by them when he first met them, they might make up enough among</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">themselves to enable him to buy a new team aud dray in Sydney. The pro-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">posal had been readily acceded to, and when the two troopers and Wilton</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had parted from the main body, the latter had in his possession a variety of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">orders on Sydney agents totaling to a sufficient^ large sum to set his mind</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at rest as to the re-equipment of his carrying requisites.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But there was yet another change in store for him. Upon his arrival in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Sydney the shooting of Plover was reported, and all the other information</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which he had been able to obtain as to the later doings of the gang. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">news reached Major Pearson, and he exerted himself to the utmost to obtain</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the promised reward for Wilton. The result was that a laud order was given</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to him and he discussed with Farrell the best course to adopt.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I'll tell you what I would do," the honest trooper answered. " I would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">apply for Meleelee Run. Doolan's dead, and as far as we know there is 110</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">one who can claim to be his heir. If the government give it to you, then</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">you'll be in the district where Midnight generally is, and who knows but that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">you will be able to finish my task and find the major's daughter? "</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" It's a bargain on one condition," Wilton said. "You saved me from</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and share the place, I'll apply forit. Then we can track Midnight together."</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">It took some persuasion to make Fai'rell agree, but in the end he con-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sented, and again with the major's influence behind him, Wilton was allowed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to use his grant in taking up the unoccupied run of Meleelee.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Instead of buying a team and a dray with the funds the squatters had</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">As Wilton sat under the shadow of his veranda smoking his solitary pipe,</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He rose from his seat and turning towards the door of the hut, he caught</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sight of a black fellow only a few yards away from him, in the act of raising</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his spear to throw.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The first impulse that came to Wilton was to dash into the hut and seize</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">door when a sudden wave of compassion seemed to pass over him and he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">turned and went to the black fellow. As he stooped over him he gave an ex-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">clamation of horror, for he saw that the unfortunate creature's back was so</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hideously scored and cut, that it looked as if it had been flayed. There was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">only one instrument which could have inflicted such brutal injuries, and that</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Warrigal long before the white man had discerned it, he was more than as-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Warned by Johnson, Wilton had anticipated that his first meeting with</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">After he had ridden away, Wilton went inside the hut to see what had be-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">come of Worrigal. He walked over to the pile of stores and looked behind</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it, but no black fellow was there ; he glanced round the place and peered into</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">every nook and cranny where the man could hide, but all in vain. He called</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">out his name, first softly and then loudly, but received no answer. Warrigal</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had disappeared.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He came back to the doorway and stood musing. The black had not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">passed out through the door, he was certain, for either Giles or himself must</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">have seen him. The hut was a small structure and its interior formed only</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">one room, the door and a small window being the only openings for light,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ventilation or traffic that the builder had thought worth while making. How</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">then had Warrigal escaped ?</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Glancing round over his shoulder, Wilton looked at the fireplace and its</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">big wide chimney. He had not thought of that before, and crossing over the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">floor, he stooped and looked up the wide open space to the sky. There was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ample room for a man to get up if he were as agile and nimble as a monkey,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and Wilton knew that a black had both qualifications to perfection.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He went outside the hut and searched for any signs there might be which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would confirm his suspicions. There may have been plenty, but Wilton was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not skilled enough to read them, and he returned to the doorway feeling baffled</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and angry. The spears that Warrigal had placed in his hand had also vanished,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and the words Giles had said to him came again to his mind and he felt that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he had been in error in allowing his kindly sympathies to get the better of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him when he turned to get his rifle and shoot the black who had threatened</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" But he was such a fine looking chap," he mused. " It would have</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been downright murder to kill a man like that and in cold blood."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It never occurred to him to regard the black's disappearance otherwise</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">than as a token of treachery. The anxiety he expressed in all his movements</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when he first heard the horse was ignored by the superior intelligence of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">white man, who condemned merely because he could not understand. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">readiness with which all his questions had been answered and the information</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he wanted given to him by Warrigal was also overlooked now that he had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">come across a course of behavior which did not quite recommend itself to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him. It was the usual result when white met black. All that the white</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">man expected the black never did, while he would do what no white man</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would ever dream of doing, nor could ever understand. And the result was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a firm conviction of the innate treachery of the black and the necessitj7, as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Giles had said, to shoot on sight, unless the white man wanted to be speared.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The same line of ideas occurred to Wilton as he stood musing at his door.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He had allowed the black to see that he was the only man about the place,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and had also exposed the stores which were inside the hut. It only required</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a touch of nervousness to make Wilton believe, at once, that the black had</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">been an emissary from a tribe, sent with their treacherous cunning, to as-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">certain whether an attack could safely be made upon the hut.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The soft sound of a distant coo-ee came to him through the still air of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">evening. He turned to where his rifle was, and, taking it up, examined the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">primings carefully, without stopping to consider that if the black had sought</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to betray him, he would have taken all the weapons he could find, as well as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his spears, when he made his escape. Wilton examined the pistol he had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">taken from the bushranger and which he still possessed. With it in his belt,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">aud his rifle in his hand, he felt that he was better able to defend himself,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and his mind grew calmer as he added his powder flask and a small bag of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bullets to his equipment.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The darkness was gradually overcoming the last gleam of the setting sun,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and he noticed that there was a crescent moon which gave just enough light</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to enable any one to make out the hut from the surrounding trees, but which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rendered the shadows beyond impenetrable.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Wilton had heard of the method the blacks adopted in attacking a hut,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and his own experience in the dray on the flooded flat also warned him that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the worst place he could select as a shelter was his own roof. The system</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they worked on was very simple and very effective. As they approached the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hut they were going to attack, the blacks gathered long shreds of dry, stringy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bark or other fiber, and bound them, in loose sheaves, at the point of their</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spears. The huts being built entirely of wood, with perhaps large sheets of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bark for the roofing, were, in the fine dry weather that obtained for the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">greater part of the year, little; more than tinder boxes, and only needed a few</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sparks to set them ablaze.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">When the blacks were foolish enough to attack the white men by day-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">light, their rude weapons had no chance against the death dealing rifles of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the invader, and even at night the odds were in favor of the white mau under</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ordinary circumstances. So the blacks set about evolving a scheme by which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they could bring about an extraordinary series of circumstances. Perhaps</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">some of their allies among the outlawed whites helped them, but it was not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">long after settlement commenced before a new terror was added to the list of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">drawbacks to locating in the interior.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Usually when on the march, the blacks carried a " fire stick," which con-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sisted of a peculiar wood that smoldered in a hot red point, blazing into flame</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when fanned or gently blown upon. The application of the three ideas, the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fire stick, the sheaves of inflammable fiber, and the dry roof, to one another,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">produced to the aboriginal a new and powerful weapon of attack. Creeping</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">up near a lonely hut at night when the men inside considered they were safe,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at all events from surprise, glowing cinders from the fire stick were dropped</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">into the sheaves of fiber, and the spear hurled at the dry bark of the roof.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Terrified by the sudden outburst of the conflagration, the inmates rushed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from the burning hut under the impression that the bush was on fire. The</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and before they knew their danger, a flight of spears was upon them, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they fell on the threshold of their home.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">About a hundred yards from the door of the hut there was the remains</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of a big fallen tree. It had evidentljr come down in some by gone bush fire,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for its outer side was charred and burnt, and the little that remained standing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">above the roots was also burnt and black. But its fall had been of marvelous</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">benefit to a subsequent growth, and the space it had cleared when it fell was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">now crow'ded by a growth of young saplings and bushes.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Directly it was dark enough for his movements not to be observed by any</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">one w'ho might be watching, Wilton crept round under the shadow of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">veranda into the bush behind the hut. Thence he cautiously made his way</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to the clump of saplings, and lying down close under the fallen log, rested</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his rifle upon it and watched the door of the hut.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Silently the hours passed, and he lay still, listening intently for any sound</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that might signify the approach of his enemies. But the night wore on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">slowly and his ears caught nothing more than the ordinary noises, dim and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">indistinct, of the sleeping bush. The moon was waning, and its weak slant-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing beams illuminated the open spaces enough to make the shadows beyond</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">absolutely impenetrable.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">With his senses keenly 011 the alert, Wilton was convinced, in his own</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mind, that an attack was to be made upon him ; and, as the time passed, the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">suspense and uncertainty began to tell upon him, and he wished he had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ridden away after Giles, directly he discovered that Warrigal had gone.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then he wished that he had waited until Farrell could have come up with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him, for as he lay in the silence and half light, the story of how the previous</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">owner of Meleelee had met his end, forced itself upon his already strained</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nerves.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The crackle of breaking twigs sounded through the air, and instantly he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tightened his grip upon his rifle. A moment later and he saw a dark figure</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stealthily creeping toward the door of the hut from the shadow of the bush.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Wilton felt his nerves in a tremor as he watched the man, crouched down</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and moving with a wonderfully silent stealthiness towards the hut. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">faint glimmer of the fading moonlight was just sufficient to show him up as a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dark shadow, but was not enough to enable Wilton to see whether he was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">black or white, clad or naked. The way in which he moved suggested the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">black, and presently, noticing an indistinct something which looked very like</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a spear trailing behind the figure, Wilton made up his mind that it was either</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Warrigal or another member of his tribe.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The parting advice of Giles flashed through his memory, and he glanced</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">along the sight of his rifle as well as he could, so as to get a steady aim at the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">man. His finger was on the trigger, and he was about to pull it, when dis-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cretion came to him and he hesitated. Supposing that the man were only</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">one member of the tribe, who was creeping upon the hut in order to ascertain</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">THE TRACK OF MIDNIGHT.</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">whether the inmate was prepared for the altack ? To fire upon him as he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">crept up would be to alarm the remainder, while the flash of the rifle shot</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would at once locate the place where Wilton was hiding.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">On the other hand, if he were alone, there would be plenty of time and a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">better opportunity when he emerged from the hut, as he was sure to do di-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rectly he discovered that Wilton was not within. Discretion was certainly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the better part of valor, if either of these ideas were correct, and with his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">finger still on the trigger, Wilton moved his rifle slowly round so as to cover</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the advancing figure, and be ready to fire at any moment.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He saw him reach the shadow of the veranda and stand up, and, as he did</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">so, Wilton noticed that he was clothed. It was sufficient to tell him that the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">man was white, and an ugly suspicion crossed his mind. Warrigal had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spoken of Midnight as being in the neighborhood, but what if he had been</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">merely a spy sent forward by Midnight to learn how many men there were in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the hut? What if the man who was now at the door of the hut were Mid-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">- night himself? Wilton felt his heart leap at the thought. He could cover</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him directly he came from the hut, and fire when he was sure of his aim,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and then with the great outlaw dead or wounded, he could claim from his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">neighboring squatters a recognition better even than that which he had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">already received.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He lay, scarcely breathing, as he heard the hut door pushed gently open.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then an unbroken silence reigned, and he knew that the man, whoever he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was, was creeping towards the stretcher where, under ordinary circumstances,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he himself would be lying asleep. A shudder passed over him as he thought</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of his fate had he been in the hut, for he had little doubt now but that the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">man was bent upon assassination. And what resistance could he have offered</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had he been suddenly awakened to find an armed man standing over him,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">perhaps with the muzzle of a rifle pressed against his forehead, or the point</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of a dagger at his throat.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then came the sound of rapid footsteps from the interior of the hut, and,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gripping his rifle tightly, Wilton watched for the man to reappear. The hut</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">door grated as it was flung back, and just as the last of the moonlight flickered</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the ground, the man stepped from under the veranda and glanced round.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Wilton felt his heart stop, and then beat and throb in the excitement of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the moment, for there, barely fifty yards away, stood the unmistakable figure</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of Midnight.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">With his rifle aimed point blank at the broad chest of the outlaw, he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pulled the trigger. The report of the shot sounded so loud to his overstrained</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nerves that he sprang up as he heard it, and so was able to see over the smoke</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that hung along the ground, able to see the bushranger stagger back, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hear the hoarse exclamation which broke from his lips.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Wilton shouted in the ecstasy of victory as he leaped forward, pistol in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hand, to challenge the man to surrender or die. But he had forgotten who</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his opponent was.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">As he came out of the shade of his protecting bushes, he saw Midnight</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">raise his rifle. In the recklessness of the excitement which was upon him,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Wilton aimed his pistol and pulled the trigger. There was a little flash and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">a puff of smoke, and a mocking laugli came from Midnight. The pistol had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">missed fire.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">With his rifle empty, and his pistol useless, Wilton was at the mercy of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the man whom common report said was merciless. The desperate position he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was in came to him more quickly than he could have thought, and he turned</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and sprang into the shelter of the bushes. He heard the report of the bush-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ranger's rifle ; something whizzed past his ear, burning it as if a piece of hot</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">iron had touched it; a horrible sense of fear swept over him., and Wilton fled</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for his life.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Neither heeding nor thinking where he was going he rushed madly for-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ward, crashing through the undergrowth, tripping and stumbling over fallen</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">logs and projecting roots, until suddenly the trees ceased, and before and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">around him he realized that there was open space. The fear of the man,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whom he believed was only a few paces behind him, gave him the energy of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">despair, and he rushed onwards, blindly and wildly.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The ground went from undfer his feet ; there was a mighty rush of air,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">was as a lifetime to him as he looked upwards and backwards, and saw a long</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thin tongue of flame shoot out from the blackness of the bush that he had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">left, and the report of a rifle shot echoed through the night. Then he struck</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Fortunateljr, he was an able swimmer, and as soon as he felt himself in the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">surface, his wits about him, and the terror that had urged him to his head-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">long flight gone. As his head came above the water he glanced quickly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">round, ready to dive should he see anything of his enemy. He comprehended</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">then where he was. He had plunged into the river from the top of a high</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bluff, and the stream had already carried him far enough away for him to be</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">grasped the folly of his actiou. His empty rifle he had left on the log, when</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he sprang up to complete his conquest of the redoubtable Midnight ; his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pistol he had dropped in his rapid flight, and he was now empty handed and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">his head in a heavy fringe. As he watched there recurred to his mind the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">words of Warrigal when he said, that to shoot Midnight one would have to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Whether it was due to the excitement he had experienced the previous</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">was not sure, but he had a marvelous appetite when breakfast was served,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and his spirits were at their highest as he sat opposite Mary and chatted as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blithely as though there were no such things as bushrangers and burned huts</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in the land.</seg>

        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">beyond stock and the chances of drought or flood, with the one exception of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Johnson, and during the meal she frequently found herself comparing the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">was, the comparison between him and Wilton was generally in favor of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">latter, for not only did his conversation please and entertain her, but it also</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pleased her father so much that she heard him laugh so heartily that the dim,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">far off memory of bygone happy days came to her clearer and stronger. If</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">only she could make him laugh like that, she thought as she glanced at him,</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" It is clearer today than I ever remember it," she said softly, as though</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">she were speaking more to herself than to her companions. " That time, so</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">long ago, before we came here. There were a lot of houses, big ones and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">little ones, and a lot of water."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"You don't say you remember all that?" Giles asked, and Wilton</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">glanced at him as he heard his voice. Plis face depicted the surprise that the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tone expressed.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Wait a moment; there's some more," Mary continued. "I seem to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">be just--I don't quite know how to put it," she said as she pressed her hand</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to her forehead and her eyes grew moist.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was when she was a child; when her mother died," Giles said to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Wilton. "I did not know she remembered it. I hoped she had forgotten</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it. Do you remember how you fretted, Mary? "</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I remember crying for a long time," she answered softly.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Well, if you remember so much, I will help you, for I dare say you are</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">old enough now to look at it sensibly," Giles remarked. " You see Wilton,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it was a hard blow to me. I was ruined, and my wife died at the same time,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and then I found myself with Mary here, who was a little girl of a year or</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">so, just toddling, and all my work to be done over again. It was a case of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">seeking fresh land out further back, and I had to travel and carry the little</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">one with me till we found this patch, and I obtained the grant. She cried</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her eyes nearly out for her mother, and then used to cry, whenever she</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wasn't asleep, to go back. It was a hard time for me, and I don't like talk-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing about it," he added with a heavy sigh.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mary was sitting silent and abstracted. The brief story that her father</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">told threw a flood of light upon her memory, for she could understand the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">reason now of his moody temper. She had unconsciously made his lot the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">harder at the most painful period of his existence, and it was not to be won-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dered at that he, at a later period,should have been estranged from her.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Here was the secret that she had often tried to fathom for herself, the secret</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">why her father had ceased to be the happy, contented man she just managed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to recall, and why ho had become so morose and dissatisfied. She was not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">schooled in matters of the affections ; she had grown to womanhood with no</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">other guide or comprnion than old Narli ; but the heart of a sympathetic</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">woman had developed upon its own lines, and now wakened to the first touch</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that it had ever felt. She rose from her seat and, going over to her father,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">she threw her arms round his neck and she said brokenly :</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Oh, why did von not tell me before? I never knew, and I have won-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dered so much. ' '</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Wilton, watching the two, saw Giles' eyes light up, and into his heart</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">there came a great longing, something that he had never felt before, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">something that seemed to change and alter him in the passing of a second.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The recollection of his burned hut, his wish to hunt Midnight down, his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">anxiety to build up wealth, all faded before this new impulse which swept over</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him and carried Mary Giles up to the very pinnacle of his being and set her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">there as his idol and his love.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He saw Giles loosen his daughter's arms and gently push her away, but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he did not catch the words he uttered, and which brought a rich mantling</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">flood of color to Mary's face.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Come, let us have a smoke and a yarn," Giles said abruptly, as he rose</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from the table and walked out on the veranda.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Wilton saw Mary's eyes looking after him, while her lip trembled, and as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he passed her he looked into her face and held out his hand. He intended to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">say something, but as she took it his mind forgot what it would have expressed,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and he turned away, confused and distressed, and followed Giles out.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">So he did not see the light that came into her eyes and the smile that rip-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pled over her face before she turned and went to her own room. She sat</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">upon her roughly constructed bed, smiling, happy and joyful, for although</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her father had repelled her when she attempted to show him the affection she</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">felt for him, another had come into her life, and, in her unsophisticated man-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ner, she did not for a moment trifle with the state of her feelings.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Thus, at the same time, the two had installed-each other as the sovereign</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the heart, and only a little more was needed of that sympathy which had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">arisen for their eyes to be opened and those words to be said which would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">link their two lives into one. Untrammeled by the rules of conventional</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">society, there was no wish on either side to conceal, and only the opportunity</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was wanting when, as naturally as flowers turn to the sun, he would turn to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her, and she to him, and in the union of their loves the big battle of life be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">begun.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">As Wilton joined his host on the veranda all desire to discuss the situation</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had vanished before the new interest which had come into his life. He sat</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">down and let his mind go into a dreamy reverie, from which he was rudely</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">awakened by Giles asking if he were not going to smoke.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mechanically he took his pipe from his pocket and began cutting up his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tobacco.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Now, what's your next move ? " Giles asked. " I suppose you'll put up</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I hardly know yet," Wilton replied.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">"It's the best thing you can do, and I dare say if you pass the word</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">over the ranges to see after some cattle that are offered to me, and I was</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Wilton sat smoking in silence for some minutes while he thought rapidly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and clearly. It was very evident that the father had little real affection for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the girl, and that his chief desire now was to get her, as he put it, off his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">was to be brought from over the ranges, but whoever he was, Wilton felt,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with all the jealous apprehension of a lover, that he would be particularly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">repugnant to Mary. It was quite sufficient, in his state of mind, to deter-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">It was a pointed hint, but Wilton preferred not to accept it in view of his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">not to sleep. His mind was far too actively engaged in scheming how he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could carry out his newly formed intention of winning Mary, even in spite of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Johnson rapidly completed the operation of loading both rifles and then</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">as Warrigal and Douglas leaped out on to the open patch where he was stand-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Warrigal, as soon as the suggestion was made to him, supplemented the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He was for carrying Wilton there before starting for the horses.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" He held a pistol in his hand and shot Wilton, when I jumped for him; but</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">stole silently along until he was almost beside the trailing tendrils of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">When Wilton was again able to look around him and intelligently under-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stand what he was looking at, he found himself lying 011 a stretcher bed in-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">side a fire lit room, while in front of the fire two men sat, with their backs</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">effort it cost him to speak at all, surprised him so much that when he saw</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">one of the men turu and reveal the face of Douglas instead of that of John-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">son, it seemed quite in keeping with the other incongruities of his mind.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The man rose and came over to him, Wilton watching him with wondering</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">eyes. There was no doubt but that it was Douglas, the dim, uncertain mind</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">added to the sick man, who, tacitly accepting everything he was told, closed</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">came round in the night. Don't move," he added quickly, as Wilton made</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Wilton reviling himself because he could not express all the gratitude he felt</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to the man who had saved his life, and Johnson blaming himself for having</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The following evening saw Douglas again at Toombul. Johnson had not</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">her presence night do more for Wilton than anything else. Expecting to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">see her, he wondered when Douglas did not return as early as he should have</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">dragged until it seemed that hours had passed since his comrade went away.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">water, and he saw that the stream was narrower where he was and flowing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with a tremendous current. Stripping off his boots and coat, he tied the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">length of rope round his waist. Then he plunged in, striking out with all his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">strength diagonally across the river, the current carrying him along with fear-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ful velocity. Around him the water bubbled and boiled, and logs floating with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the current threatened a greater danger than the flood. But he was a strong,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">able swimmer, and he was well in the center of the stream when he saw the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">clump of trees immediately before him. The rush of water, as it approached</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the obstacle to its course, divided, and the hardest part of his task was to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">prevent himself being carried out again. He was spun round in the eddies</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and almost dragged under as he neared the trees ; then he seemed for a mo-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ment to have got into still water, and in another second he was clinging,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">haste on here, expecting to find you and Wilton. Instead we found Douglas,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">who made us comfortable, and we decided to camp here until you and Wilton</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">rushed through the bush in the direction of the gully in which the cave was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">situated. Once they stopped to reload their rifles and listen if any one else</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were near them, but they could distinguish nothing, and resumed their march.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The gray dawn was showing when they came to the edge of the steep bank</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">up which they had carried Wilton. They hastily clambered down, and then</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hastened along the gully till they reached the boulder at the end.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">They found the cave was a small chamber formed by a projecting ledge,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the underside of which sloped inwards, leaving barely room for a man to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stand upright in the middle. A couple of blankets thrown together, with the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ordinary articles of a bushman's camp lying beside them, were all the cave</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"I think we shall be better on the bank," Johnson said, as he glanced</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" There's not much here," Douglas answered, as he held the vine back</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and made as if to step out. But a sound caught his ear, and he grasped</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Johnson by the arm.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" He's coming," he wdiispered hoarsely.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">There was the noise of some one treading heavily and clumsily beyond</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the boulder, and then a man staggered round it. He groaned as he leaned</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">against it for a moment before he slipped weakly to the ground. There was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">no mistaking the jet black hair and beard, but the face was ghastly pale</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">now, and the swaggering form of the once redoubtable Midnight was limp and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">helpless.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">As the two squatters stood watching him from behind the sheltering vine,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a momentary twinge of pity passed through each, as they saw the man make</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a great effort to rally himself.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Painfully he struggled to unloosen his coat, and when he had it open they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">saw under it a crudely, heavily fashioned cuirass. He pulled and tugged at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the straps with which it was fastened, and as it fell from him, he leaned back</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">against the boulder once more and gasped.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">His head drooped forward on his hands, and the watchers saw his fingers</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">working amongst his hair, and then the mass of raven locks slipped over the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">head, carrying with them the beard and a roughly made helmet. The exer-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tion of getting them off had almost exhausted the wounded outlaw, and once</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">more he let his head rest against the boulder.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">As his face became visible, Johnson and Douglas started to their feet and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sprang towards him with .loud cries. The face of the stricken man was the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">face of him whom they had long known as Giles !</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He turned towards them and strove to get on his feet; but he was too far</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gone, and rolled over in a swoon.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The two men stood over him, too horrified to speak, and too indignant to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">feel even pity for the wretch whose life was ebbing away at their feet.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Slowly he regained consciousness, and looked at them with malignant</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Too late," he gasped out, and lay back, dead.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" At Zaila ?" repeated the captain, with a look of sudden surprise. " Ah,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">yes. Possibly tomorrow, probably not until the following day."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was now Guy's turn to be surprised.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Do you mean to tell me," he said, " that it takes two or three days to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cross the Gulf of Aden?"</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"No," replied the captain bruskly. " You are surely aware, my dear</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sir, that we proceed first to Berbera, and from thence up the coast to Zaila."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Then you have deceived me, sir," cried Guy hotly. " You told me this</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">morning that this steamer went to Zaila. ' '</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Certainly I did," replied the captain. " You didn't ask for any more</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">information, or I should have told you that jve went to Berbera first. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">great annual fair has just opened at Berbera, and I have on board large</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stores of merchandise and trading properties. On other occasions I go to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Zaila first, but during the progress of the fair I always go direct to Berbera</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and unload. I supposed that fact to be generally understood," and, turning</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on his heel, the captain walked off to give some orders to his men.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Guy was half inclined to be angry at first, but on reflection he concluded</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he was just as well satisfied. Besides, it would give him a chance to see that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wonderful African fair, which he now remembered to have heard about on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">different occasions.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But one other person was visible on the deck, a short, chunky man, with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a dark complexion, and crafty, forbidding features.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A Portuguese or a Spaniard Guy put him down for at once, and he con-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ceived a deep mistrust of him instantly. The fellow, however, was inclined</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to be sociable.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">' ' Ah, an Englishman,' ' he said, coming up to Guy and holding out his hand,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">an action which Guy professed not to see.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" You are going to Berbera, perhaps," he went on, nowise discomfited by</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"No," said Guy shortly. "To Zaila."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Ah, yes, Zaila! You have friends there, perhaps? I, too, am ac-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">His keen eyes scanned Guy's face closely, and noted the faint gleam of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">surprise at this information.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But Guy was too clever to be thrown off his guard.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Yes," he said. " I know some people here. I have not the pleasure of</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He would have turned away at this point, but the man pulled a card from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his pocket and presented it to him. Guy glanced it over with interest :</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">C. Manuel Torres,</seg>
        </ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">Trader at Aden and Berbera.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"A vile Portuguese slave hunter," he thought to himself.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Well, Mr. Torres," he said. " I am sorry that I have no cards about</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">me, but my name is Chutney."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The Portuguese softly whispered the name once or twice. Then, without</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">further questioning, he offered Guy a cigar, and lit one himself.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Manuel Torres proved to be quite an interesting companion, and gave Guy</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">As they went below at dinner time he pointed out on the corner of the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Those are mine," he said. " They contain iron and steel implements</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"They look like rifle cases," Guy remarked carelessly; and, looking at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the Portuguese as he spoke, he fancied that the dark face actually turned</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gray for an instant. In a moment they were seated at the table, and the brief</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">occurrence was forgotten.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">All that afternoon they steamed on across the gulf, overhead the blue</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and cloudless sky, beneath them waters of even deeper blue, and at sunset</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the yellow coast line of the African continent loomed up from the purple</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Guy had been dozing under an awning most of the afternoon, but now</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he came forward eagerly to get his first glimpse of eastern Africa.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">To his great disappointment, the captain refused to land.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was risky, he said, to make a landing at night, and it would be dark</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when they entered the harbor. They must lie at anchor till morning.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Most of the night Guy paced up and down the deck, sleeping at brief</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">intervals, and listening with eager curiosity to the strange sounds that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">floated out 011 the air from the shore, where the flickering glare of many</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">torches could be seen.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Stretched on a mattress, the Portuguese slept like a log, without once</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A cry of horror burst from his lips as he dragged it out. The lock was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">broken, and the sides were flapping apart. For one brief second he stared at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it like a madman, and then, with frantic haste, he fell 011 his knees, and,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">plunging his hands inside, began to toss the contents recklessly out upon the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">floor. Toilet articles, linen, cigars, writing paper, jewelry, and various</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">other things piled up until his finger nails scraped the bottom. He turned</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the case bottom up and shook it savagely, shook it until the silver clasps</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rattled against the sides, and then he sank back with a groan, while the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">drops of perspiration chased each other down his haggard cheeks.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">For the time being Guy was fairly driven out of his senses by the horror</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the calamity. Ruin stared him in the face. What madness it was to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">leave those papers in his cabin ! He had foolishly hesitated to carry them on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his person for fear the perspiration would soak them through and through,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">aud now they were hopelessly lost. The cabin door had been locked, too.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The thief must have had a key.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The first shock over, his manliness asserted itself, and he took a critical</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">view of the situation. He hardly suspected any person as yet. The des-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">patches must be recovered. That was the first step.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He flew up the stairs, three at a time, and rushed panting and breathless</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">All about him was the hurry and bustle of preparation. The shore was</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Overcome by a sudden fright, the Arab staggered backward a pace, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">like a flash the leopard shot to the end of his chain, and fastening teeth and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">those who stood near made no move. The big negro danced wildly up and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">down, keeping well out of reach of his savage pet, and the slaves howled with</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The negro uttered a howl and tried to'push him back, but Guy forced his</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was a good shot. The leopard rolled over lifeless, and the Arab, with</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But the Arab, too, had friends in the crowd, and they, pressing forward in</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Just as the issue was trembling in the balance, a shout arose from the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Zaila, and they contain instructions bearing on the very matter you have just</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mentioned. The authorities at the colonial office in London told me in secret</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">I see it all. Makar had collected his Arabs and Somalis at Berbera by the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">"No, no," groaned Forbes. "That would be useless. Zaila is sixty</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">miles up the coast. We can beat the Arabs, and get there in time to prepare</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the town for defense. The garrison is wretchedly small, but they will have</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">They called the captain aside, and told him just enough to impress him</seg>

        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">now every escape was cut off. The firing was sharp and severe for a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The residency was cordoned by a surging mass of wretches, intoxicated</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">No person seemed inclined to talk. Sir Arthur sat up against the parapet</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">for this uprising, for it had apparently broken out in all quarters of the town</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at once, and the expected signal had no doubt been the approach of the Arabs</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from Berbera, for the vast number of rifles used in the fight proved conclu-</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Wonderful success had crowned their plans. Yesterday the garrison at</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Melton was inclined to think that the Arabs were only waiting for day-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">loudly and excitedly all the while.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Once Guy ventured to peer down over the parapet, and to his surprise he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">saw Arab guards at the residency door, sternly keeping back the crowd. Then</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he pulled aside the stone from the trap. All was dark and quiet beneath.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Of a sudden a great hush fell on the vast crowd, the tuniult died away to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a low murmur, and from the outskirts came a strange sound, at first low and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">indistinct, and then louder and more vivid, like the tinkling of bells mingled</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The Arabs and Somalis fell silently apart, leaving open a wide passage</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Makar held a short conversation with three or four Arabs, and then,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">he had borrowed it from Dolph. But what he had heard showed him that it</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">There was a great trunk line railroad about five miles south of Montoban,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">all the water used was diverted from the river, and so much power was taken</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from the lower privilege. Whether or not it was lawful for him to divert</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The rapid evaporation of the fluid was instantly followed by a sensation of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">within, and every other opening was still closed. Norbert was looking round</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to find out the reason when Gertrude exclaimed from the other window :</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" What a very strange view ! I never saw anything like it ! The earth-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Every one ran to see what was the matter.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The changes were indeed remarkable. In place of the yellow sandy plain</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that formerly stretched iu uniform monotony almost to the very foot of Teh-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bali, broken only here and there by a few undulations, they now beheld an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">abyss whence rose up sharply defined' serrated mountains.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It appeared as if the crust had given way under the influence of some</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mighty subterranean force that had torn up the surface and redistributed it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in weird, fantastic forms.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Bright red, staring yellow, pale blue, and violet colored rocks stood out on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">every side in a medley of color that was far from pleasing to the eye. In the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ravines flowed lava of every hue similar to that found on Vesuvius and Etna.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">It w^as, in fact, evident that they were real volcanic craters, now extinct and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">silent. There they were, side by side, of every imaginable height and size.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was impossible to estimate the distance properly, for by a strange op-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tical illusion the rocks that were furthest stood out as clearly as the near ones,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dowm to the least little detail. Instead of diminishing gradually to the van-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ishing point, they were so boldly defined against the sky that it seemed almost</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as if it were possible to touch their bright colored edges.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Another remarkable circumstance was that the shadows were as clearly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">portra3?ed in the blinding light as were the rocks themselves. They were all</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as black as ink, without any graduation or shading off.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The aspect of the landscape was more terrifying and spectral than can be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">conceived. There was no trace of life anywhere. Neither bird, bush, nor</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blade of grass was to be seen ; nor was the silence broken by the sound of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">any trickling brook. The impression left upon the mind was that of utter</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">solitude, desolation, and death.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Another strange phenomenon was to be noted. Although the sun shone</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in the full blaze of his meridian splendor on the bare and dreary waste, myriads</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of starry constellations were apparent in the deep gloom of the sky. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">effect was startling. It was similar to that produced by lighted candles round</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a funeral bier in broad daylight.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">As to the hostile Mahdist and Arab camps that had encircled the Peak of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Tehbali, they were nowhere to be seen ! All trace of them had disappeared.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The catastrophe had seemingly swallowed up tents, batteries, men, and</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But the strangest fact was the great height from which they now looked</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">down. It seemed as if, in the general upheaval, the earth at the foot of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mountain had shrunk at the same time. This was the general impression.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Their eyes had been 'accustomed for a long while to the vertical distance of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">something quite different,'for they looked down now from a height of at least</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fifteen or twenty thousand feet, perhaps even more.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">To the general surprise, he rushed to the half open door, and slammed it</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">There were a few breakages, but nothing of importance. They had done</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">There was not much change apparently in the esplanade. They went</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Contrary to Norbert's expectation, there was nothing fresh to be seen</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">here. The path wound as formerly, down the flank of the Peak, till it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">reached the bed of vitrified glass under the mountain. But instead of. a plain</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stretching beyond, there was now a considerable space between the end of the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">And another strange thing ! Instead of facing east, as formerly, the path</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lay now towards the north, as shown both by the position of the sun and by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the little pocket compass Norbert had with him. In fact, it was clear that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not only the summit of Tehbali, but the entire mountain, had been forcibly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">transported by some irresistible power from one globe to the other.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The heat was intense, owing to the almost verticle rays of the sun, which</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the protuberances on the surface were now more clearly visible to the naked</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">This was a joyful discovery to Norbert, who was an ardent astronomical</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">student. It was to be explained by the extreme tenuity of the atmosphere,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which accounted also for the appearance at midday of countless starry con-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stellations. The earthly atmosphere is like a veil between our glasses and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the stars ; but the lunar atmosphere leaves free passage to the rays of light</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">or of heat, and unlike that of the earth it lends no azure hue to the sky,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which, viewed from the moon, is black as ink.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Not only did our two explorers find themselves in a furnace-like heat, but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they also discovered that they were now of an extraordinary lightness. They</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">scarcely felt their feet as they tripped along rather than walked. Every</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">moment they were making extraordinary bounds, sometimes of four or five</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">yards, while meaning to step aside from some little obstacle, such as a stone</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">or piece of rock.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">These gymnastics were so involuntary that each looked at his companion</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in astonishment. Norbert stared at seeing the baronet gamboling along in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">this way, leaping lightly like a hare, and bounding aloft every now and then</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as if he were a rubber ball. \</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"There is something marvelous about this," he thought. "He will</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At this moment he himself made a slight backward movement to avoid a</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The baronet, his own gymnastic exercise scarcely over, looked at Norbert</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with displeased surprise at such undignified pranks.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I have it ! " suddenly thought Norbert. " Gravity is playing us these</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tricks. It is six times less on the moon than on the earth. It follows that</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He could not resist the pleasure of communicating the interesting fact to</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Well, my dear fellow," said he, "do you at last believe you are in the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">To his great surprise, there was no reply. The baronet did not pay the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">least attention to him, but gave a tremendous leap over a little rivulet that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the rains had left in the road.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Norbert thought at first from his silence and the expression of indifference</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on his countenance that Sir Bucephalus was in the sulks. But what had he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">done to offend him ? He could not conceive what his offense had been.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" What an odd idea !" thought Norbert. " Such a strange time, too, to</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But in the midst of these reflections he suddenly went off into a fit of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Nothing could be more striking than the contrast between the rock of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">ered with yellow grass and various kinds of shrubs ; that of the slope was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bright green, interspersed with glistening mauve and gray streaks of color,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">without the least trace of vegetation.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">There were thus two perfectly distinct zones : the upper one, belonging to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Instead of descending the slope, Norbert chose to skirt it horizontally for</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">odd at first sight. But, given an explosion of subterranean force, caused by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the sudden backward recoil of the moon, it appears only natural that the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the sandy soil that had been its bed. Once launched into space, the solid</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">ligible since our satellite almost touched the earth). The conical shape of</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A walk of a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes brought them to a point</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">by a ceiling, by the vitrified base of the mountain of Tehbali. He hailed the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">discovery as one likely to settle the point that was now occupying his atten-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">At first they could distinguish nothing, owing to the comparative obscur-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">in an immense cavity--none other, indeed, than the cavity of athe crater of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Rheticus. It was cup shaped at the bottom, and covered over at the top by a</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">In order to make sure of the fact, Norbert lit some matches he had in his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pocket, and held them up as high as-he could. The light reflected from the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">top proved conclusively that the roof was in very truth t he vitrified glass</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">There was so little doubt about it that even the baronet was struck by it.</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It seemed, therefore, certain that he was not in the crater, and he must</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">There was no baronet to be seen in the drawing room, as they had hoped,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but there were: traces of his appetite. The lunch left on the table was half</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The explanation seemed plausible, and was accepted by the company in</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" Where shall we find its alphabet?" said Norbert. " I own that I never</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Perhaps we can devise a substitute," rejoined the doctor. " I used to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">know it pretty well, once upon a time, and it is much easier than is generally</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">supposed. One has only to remember the conventional finger signs that stand</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for the twenty four letters of the alphabet; it is much easier for us than for</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The doctor proceeded to teach them all the other letters of the alphabet</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Norbert gave him a look to show that he understood, and left the table</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and examined it with scientific curiosity. All at once he stooped, took the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dead man's hand, and looked intently at a red patch on it that appeared to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">have been the effect of the sun's heat.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Turning back to his companions, and seeing that they was evidently sur-</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At the same time he inflated the lungs of the supposed corpse by blowing</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">window. In another half minute he had gone down it, hand under hand,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">search of the entire seaboard of the island, they had discovered no actual proof</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">A faint tinge of returning color at length appeared in the child's pale</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cheeks and lips. This had been succeeded by a fluttering sigh or two, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">then her eyes had opened suddenly with a look of terror, which had given</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">place to one of joy and relief as she recognized her father and mother bend-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing over her. Upon this Henderson had gently raised her and promptly ad-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ministered the draft which he had prepared.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Presently the little creature spoke. "Oh, mamma," she exclaimed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">looking somewhat wildly about her, "is it morning ? Is it time to get up ? I</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Yes ; go to sleep again like a good girl," agreed Henderson ; " but you</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">can tell us your dream first, dear, if you very much wish to do so. You for-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">good deal of light upon the state of affairs, and afford us information of the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Oh," began the child, " I dreamt that we--Mr. Grant and Percy and I,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">you know--had been to the beach gathering shells; and as we were coming</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">back in the boat a great ship suddenly came round the corner, full of ugly,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wicked men ; and they fired guns at us, and one of them hit Mr. Grant, for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I saw the blood running down his face. They came after us in a boat, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were quite near us when wTe reached the creek; and then Mr. Grant told</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Percy and me to run home as fast as ever wTe could ; and he took one of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">boat's oars and got out and stood on the beach, and looked as if he w^as going</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to fight the men. So Percy took my hand, and we ran--oh, ever so fast; and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I looked around and saw Mr. Grant fighting all the men with the oar; and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">then we turned a corner, and I felt tired and wanted to stop; but Percy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wouldn't let me, and we kept on running, and I began to cry. And just as</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">it was Mr. Grant, but it wasn't; it was one of the ugly men out of the ship;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and he had a long knife in his hand. So we ran faster, and then Percy fell</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">down; but I ran on, and the ugly man caught Percy, and--oh mamma !"</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Here the poor little creature's eyes filled with tears, and the frightened look</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">returned to them. " Was it a dream, or did it really happen ?"</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" It really happened, dear," answered Henderson, who made it a point of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">never deceiving his child about anything; "it really happened; but never</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mind; you are with us now, you know, and quite safe, so lie down and try to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">go to sleep. And do not trouble about Percy; we will have him and his papa</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">both safe back with us tomorrow morning, please God ! What a horrible</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">experience for the poor child--and what dreadful news about those two !"</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he murmured to his wife, as Lucille sank back and closed her eyes again</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">under the influence of the soothing draft he had administered. "Fancy</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Manners' voice hailing outside ? Stay here with Lucille and hold her hand ;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it will soothe her, and I will go and lower the ladder."</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Arrived at the head of the staircase, Henderson approached the parapet,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and, leaning over, peered down into the gathering darkness.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Is that you, Manners?" he asked, seeing a couple of figures standing</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Ay, ay, sir ; here we are," answered Manners for himself and his com-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The ladder was lowered, and in another moment Nicholls made his appear-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ance above the parapet, closely followed by Manners, who immediately hauled</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Well," questioned Henderson impatiently, seeing that neither of the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"The worst, sir, the very worst," answered Manners, with unusual</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">emotion. "They've got both Mr. Grant and little Percy ; and, would you</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">believe it, sir? The fiends have actuallj' been ill treating the poor little fel-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Henderson groaned aloud in his bitterness of spirit on hearing this.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"It's awful, isn't it, sir?" continued Manners, grinding his teeth with</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">There's nothing would have suited me better, for it made fairly mad to see the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">of them for us. I counted twenty seven of them, all told, after the second</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">party had come ashore from the proa. We couldn't have done any good.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">bad watched them for some time, I thought our best plan would be to come</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">back here and consult with you, especially as they seemed to be getting ready</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to beat up our quarters. But we're determined, Nicholls and I, to have a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">slap at them some time tonight in some shape or form, and the only question</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">is, how is it best to be done ?' '</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Henderson stretched out a hand to each of them, which was cordially</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">grasped as he said huskily,</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Thank you, thank you, my stanch and trusty friends, both; we will</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">have a slap at them, as you say. But we must do nothing hastily or without</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">careful consideration--the issues involved are too many, the stake too great</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for us to risk anything by over rashness. Let us each think the matter over</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">carefully. And, meanwhile, as we shall need all our strength, you, Nicholls,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">go down and bring us up something to eat and drink, as this may be our only</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">chance to snatch a morsel of refreshment. And whilst he is doing that,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">perhaps you, Manners, will kindly go down and bring up all the arms and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ammunition you can find, so that if the Malays come this way we may be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">prepared to give them a warm reception. I will keep watch here."</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The two men soon returned from below in the performance of their sev-</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A few minutes later the moon rose slowly into view from above the low</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Though none of them had the slightest appetite for food, three men</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">well that ere long they would have need of all their strength ; and, whilst</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">What, he asked himself, could have been the motive of the Malays in</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">plunder, and the extortion of a ransom ? And, if so, he was resolved that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">anything in reason which might be demanded--anything, in short, which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">should leave the party with the means of defending themselves and providing</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">shadows, which they speedily identified as human fignres, the more readity</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from the fact that a stray moonbeam occasionally fell upon and glinted from</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The two or three were quickly joined by others, who emerged silently</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Now, sir, what do you say? Shall we open fire upon them, you and I,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">matters worse for poor Grant. Our policy is to keep them in the dark as long</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">They evidently seemed quite unable to arrive at any satisfactory conclu-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">having been carefully closed--seemed to have excited misgiving rather than</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">confidence in their breasts, for a figure would now and then detach itself from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the rest and, 011 hands and knees, advance cautiously a little way through</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the long grass into the open, as though to gain a nearer view of the building,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and then somewhat precipitately retire again, as though the courage of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the former--next day, Grant and Percy would be delivered up by their</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Trimble. The boys take to him, which arouses the ire of Mrs. Trimble's son Jonah, who abstracts</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from his pocket a letter speaking of young Forrester, the boy injured at school. Jeffreys is once</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">more cast on the cold charities of the world, which throws him only one sop, in the shape of Julius,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his guardian's dog, who has been abandoned when Mr. Halgrove moves away leaving not a trace</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">behind. Jeffreys tramps his way to Grangerham, where he can find out but little about For-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rester, and then, seeking refuge for the night in a tumble down shed, overhears a plot to abduct</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Percy Rimbolt, the fourteen year old son of a wealthy family in the neighborhood. With the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">assistance of the dog, Julius, he frustrates this and restores Percy to his home.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Rimbolt takes a fancy to Jeffreys and appoints him to the post of private librarian at a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">salary of a hundred pounds a year. He gets on famously with Percy, End is treated with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">marked favor by Raby Atherton, Percy's cousin. But Mrs. Rimbolt dislikes the newcomer and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">neglects no opportunity to humiliate him. During the holidays Mrs. Scarfe and her son arrive</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on a visit, and in the young man Jeffreys recognizes a schoolmate at Bolsover, one fully cogni-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">zant of the Forrester affair. Some time later, after the household has moved to London, Scarfe</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">writes to Mrs. Rimbolt, telling, in exaggerated fashion, why Jeffreys left Bolsover. Mr. Rimbolt,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">who has been made acquainted with the whole history and elected to take Jeffreys for what he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">is and not for what he was, is away, and as Mrs. Rimbolt requests the librarian to leave the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">house within half an hour, he has no Qhoice but to obey. Once more adrift, he wanders about</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">London, and is soon on the verge of starvation. One night he saves a man who has tried to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">drown himself and who proves to be Jonah Trimble. Jeffreys cares for him as well as he can,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and then coming back one day to their poor shelter finds Jonah dead and a note from the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">" angel " he has talked of as visiting him, saying that he passed away peacefully, and the writing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">is that of Raby Atherton. But Jeffreys' pride will not suffer him to reveal his whereabouts, even</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">though he sees an advertisement of Mr. Rimbolt's asking for the information. He does call on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a firm of attorneys, through whom Raby's father is seeking news of Gerrard Forrester, and tells</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">all he knows, but absolutely refuses to see their principal. In his poor home at Star Alley he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">makes himself of use to the other lodgers, and on the death of a poor woman adopts her two</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">little boys. Shortly after this a fire breaks out in the neighborhood and Jeffreys saves a bed*</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ridden inmate of the burning house and brings him to his own attic. As the fellow slowly</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">good what properly belonged to my w'ard. I urged in vain that my ward</seg>
