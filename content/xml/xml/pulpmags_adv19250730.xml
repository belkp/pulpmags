        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Pere Carbon was a fisherman who peddled</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his wares between the edge of the sea marsh</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and the town of St. Pierre. Gnarled,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">weather-beaten, receiving tales but never</seg>

        </ab>
        
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Thus, when next old Marcel encountered</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the rickety, dripping fish wagon, he unbur-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">doned himself of his fears. He was a care-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ful man, as Pere Carbon knew. His wife</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had been young--almost a child. Yet she</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had gone in a day. And now what about</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his son, Vic? Of course he was doing what</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he could. But who knew? For all his care</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the little one might snap out like a match in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the wind.</seg>
        </ab>
        
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Pere Carbon considered the matter, twist-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing a strand of wet moss that he had drawn</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">through the slats of his wagon. Knowing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his petitioner, he did not suggest a second</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wife. Indeed, it was through just such deli-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cate distinctions that folk had come to con-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fide in him.</seg>
        </ab>
        
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> It was life, he observed finally. One must</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">expect such things. It was best to leave</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">them to le bon Dieu. Why worry about</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">them?</seg>
        </ab>
        
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> However, it was possible to set one's mind</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at rest by consulting a wise man. There</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Perhaps old Marcel had heard of him? He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it was who threw the card. To him such</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> They found the wise man before the door</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of his hut, a fantastic arrangement of drift-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wood and marsh grass that resembled the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">creature, this sage, incredibly old and thin,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with eyes that seemed to have withdrawn</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">into the uttermost depths of the red-rimmed</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the full glare of the sun, he faced his visitors</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with no faintest sign of recognition.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> At a word from Pere Carbon old Marcel</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">squatted also. Next, producing three silver</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dollars, he laid them silently before him.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Still the seer remained motionless. True,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his eyes performed a strange contortion.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was as if they slipped furtively out to the</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Observing this, old Marcel added a fourth</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dollar to the ones before him. For all the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">effect they produced they might have been</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> A fifth dollar proved more potent. At</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sight of it the wise man became instantly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and weirdly alive. With one skinny arm he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">reached out for the money. With the other</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he fumbled about at the door of his hut until</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he had unearthed a handful of filthy cards.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">These he nursed into a pack; afterward</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spreading them, backs up, in a single sweep</seg>

        </ab>
        
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> For three long minutes he eyed the cards,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">brooding motionless. Then, all at once, his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hand went out to hover above them. There</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was no twist, no jerk, no downward thrust</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">so far as the watchers could see. Yet, for all</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that, a card jumped suddenly out from the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> The moment had come. Nor was old</seg>

        </ab>
        
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> There was a space of silence. For a time</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it seemed that old Marcel would have only</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his trouble for his pains. But at last the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wise man spoke, slowly, wheezingly, his</seg>

        </ab>
        
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> That was all. Though old Marcel waited</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">patiently, the wise man did not speak again.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Rather he froze into a still more rigid pose,</seg>

        </ab>
        
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> "So," muttered Pere Carbon. "We will</seg>

        </ab>
        
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> And the visitors withdrew, leaving the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">words. For the rest, the danger might well</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">be avoided. What if the wise man had said</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">"In a house," "On a horse?" Here would</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Thus old Marcel returned hopefully to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">owned he discarded, replacing them with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stools and boxes. The thing was quite plain.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">It had been planned that, during his early</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Later, when Vic was running wild about</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">with himself. The danger of an infantile</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Miguez came to his feet in a flash, his grin</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Vic did not hesitate. He affected a bore-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">he played briefly, standing up to his bets</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at the tables. His drinks he took at the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bar. Only his meals found him seated.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">And through it all he moved with a shrewd-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">As it had raised him up, so would it dash</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> This was Vic's creed, born of his super-</seg>
