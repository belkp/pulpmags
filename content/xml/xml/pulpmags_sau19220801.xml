                        gold ring for a ten days test at our expense. Com- pare with any $500 diamond. Guaranteed everlasting. (See chart below). If

                    <ab>300,000 Now Wear Them</ab>
                    <ab>A few years ago a new and unknown gem stone was accidentally created by M. Verneuil, the world-famous scientist. His asso-
                        ciates examined the new gem and declared the secret of making diamonds had been discovered. Scientists and jewelers pro-
                        nounced the stone a diamond! Verneuil alone was undeceived. The new gem. he says, flashes like a diamond, and will last
                        forever, but the composition is not identical. This new diamond- like gem stone was given a new name--Lachnite.</ab>
                    <ab>Already, over 300,000 Americans wear Lachnites in place of diamonds. The cost being small, they have saved probably over
                        $150,000,000.00. Wherever you go you see Lachnites, though you may not know it!</ab>
                    <ab>Lachnites resist diamond tests This chart shows the astounding similarity between Lach- nites and diamonds. They flash with
                        equal brilliance and withstand the same heat and acid tests. No wonder men cannot distinguish them even when they are placed
                        side by side. Note on the chart how common "imitation diamonds" fail to withstand the diamond tests. Buy genuine Lachnites.
                        sold in America only by Harold Lachman Company.</ab>
                    <ab>If you can tell it from a diamond, Send the coupon and only $1.00 deposit. If after 10 days wear, you or your friends can tell
                        the Lachnite from a diamond, send it back. We will refund your deposit at once. If you decide to buy, send only $2.50 a month
                        until $18.75 has been paid.</ab>
