            <seg type="columnLine">Water lapped at his eyes. By bending his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">ped to my waist was the holster of a .38 au-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">were twisted, strangely distorted, oddly bent</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as though gnarled with fear. And, though</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">And the path broadened as it dove deeper</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The path broadened. I could see its other</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">there was no up, no down, no Space, no</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">In a minute he was back, and with him</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">I puzzled it over a bit. Then the answer</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">easy to answer. Mrs. Reynolds often went</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">away for two hours in the afternoon, and I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">myself generally took long walks. But it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was gruesome to think of the body of some</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">poor devil being carved into pieces next</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">is I am by nature a timid person. Not a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">I put off interviewing the doctor that night,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">enough. But of late there could be no blink-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">now based on a suppressed excitement which</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">quantities really went on only over a period</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">I am doubtful if he slept at all during the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and clapped his hands. Yes, I decided, he</seg>

        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">It was vibrating softly. Feeling his way</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">carefully, he maneuvered until he had a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He was going to lift it as high as he could,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">strength. The thing was unbelievably</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">heavy. He raised it a few inches; then his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">There was a loud bump, but the soft whirr-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He tensed himself. He was terribly afraid,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">sideways. And then what he had hoped</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for happened. The whirring ceased, the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">light stopped in its advance, and he knew</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that the deadly prongs were against the</seg>

        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">High in the door was a porthole of heavy</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">is one only of terminology. From a strictly literal</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">point of view empty space can be neither hot nor cold,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as Mr. KitUe states. But it is useful in practice to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">speak of space being cold, meaning that a body in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">space no matter how cold it is already will radiate heat</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">away instead of reoeiving it, or maintaining its statna</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">quo. That is, all bodies in space if they do not receive</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">heat from any suns or planets, etc. will tend to become</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">colder than they are. Thus space has a cooling in-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">A space flyer will of course lose heat continually by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">radiation, and as Mr. Kittle rightly states it will have</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to insulate itself against such loss. There is no doubt</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">however that the outer shell of the ship away from the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sun would ordinarily reach a temperature of almost</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">absolute zero because it would radiate its heat away</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">so quickly. It would not reach absolute zero because</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as it became colder and colder it would radiate more</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and more slowly and therefore it would in practice</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">always retain some heat.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Another angle of this question is presented when wo</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ask what absolute zero is. The answer is that it is an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">entire absence of heat. Since there is an entire ab-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sence of heat in empty space--it may for the purposes</seg>
