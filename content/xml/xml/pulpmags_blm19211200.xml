                    <ab>[New] Discovery Takes [Your] Flesh Almost [While] You Wait!</ab>
                    <ab>ay the very first week without medicine, cial foods, starving, or exercise. Results in 48 hours.</ab>
                    <ab>simple secret has been discovered by a great food list which enables you to eat a pound a day off your weight with perfect
                        ease. You will have no bitter self-denials; in fact, many users say they enjoy their meals as never before.</ab>
                    <ab>Thousands of men and women who have tried strenuous diets, medicine and violent exercising without results have found this new
                        scientific way a revelation. A pound or more a day from the very start is not too much to look for and with each pound you
                        lose you will note a cor-responding increase in energy and general health.</ab>
                    <ab>Women so stout they could never wear light colors or attractive styles without being conspicu-ous marvel at the change that
                        has enabled them to wear the most vividly colored and fluffy-styled clothes. Men who used to puff when they walked the least
                        bit quickly--men who were rapidly becoming inactive and sluggish, unable to enjoy outdoor exercise or pleasures, find their
                        youth- ful energy returning -- to their surprise delight.</ab>
                    <ab>How the Secret Works</ab>
                    <ab>The whole thing about this won- derful new way to reduce, which makes losing flesh a pleasure instead of a task, is a simple
                        system of food combination discovered by Eugene Christian.</ab>
                    <ab>Some of us eat food that is almost immediately converted into muscle, bone and tissue. Others eat food that is quickly
                        converted into use- less fat. In this latter case, the muscles, bones and tissues are robbed of just so much nutrition and
                        strength. That is why fat people have but little resistance and succumb first in case of illness.</ab>
                    <ab>Eugene Christian, the famous Food Specialist, while engaged in one of his extensive food experiments, discov- ered the perfect
                        cure for "disease of obesity," as he calls it. He found that merely by following certain little natural laws, food is
                        converted into essential tissue and muscle, while oniy enough fat is stored up to provide the necessary body heat. Elated with
                        this discovery and what it would mean to thousands of men and women. Christian has incorporated all his valuable information
                        in the form of little easy-to-follow lessons under the name of "Weight Con- trol the Basis of Health," which is offered on
                        free trial.</ab>
                    <ab>There are no fads in this course, no starving, no medi- cines, no exercises -- nothing but pure common-sense, practical help
                        that will do just what we say--take off flesh almost while you wait." Eat many of the delicious foods you may have been denying
                        yourself, observing of course moderation. Do pretty much as you please, give up bitter self-denials--just follow the directions
                        outlined in Christian's wonderful course, and watch your super- fluous weight vanish.</ab>
                    <ab>Nothing Like It Before</ab>
                    <ab>YouVe never tried anything like this new method of bugene Christian's before. It's entirely different. Instead of starving
                        you, it shows you how to eat off weight_a pound a day. No trouble, no fuss, no self-denials. All so simple that you'll be
                        delighted--and amazed. </ab>
                    <ab>Here's what Christian's course in Weight Control will do for you. First it will bring down your weight to normal, to what it
                        should naturally be. Then it will make your flesh firm and solid. It will bring a new glow to your cheeks, a new sparkle to
                        your eyes, a new spring in your step. It will give you charm grace, attractiveness. And all naturally, mind you. Nothing
                        harmful. We want you to prove it yourself. We want you to see results; to see your own unnecessary flesh vanish. We want you
                        to see why all starving medicines and strenuous exercising are unnecessary--why this new discovery gets right down to the real
                        reason for your stoutness, and removes it by natural methods.</ab>
                    <ab>No Money In Advance</ab>
                    <ab>Just put your name and address on the coupon below. Don't send any money. The coupon alone will bring Eugene Christian's
                        complete course to your door, where $1.97 (plus postage) paid to the postman will make it your property.</ab>
                    <ab>As soon as the course arrives, weigh your- self. Then glance through the lessons carefully, and read the startling revelations
                        regarding weight, food and health. Now put the course to the test. Try the first lesson. Weigh yourself in a day or two again
                        and notice the result. Still, you've taken no medicines, put yourself to no hardships, done practically nothing you would not
                        ordinarily have done. It's won- derful--and you'll have to admit it yourself.</ab>
                    <ab>Mail the coupon NOW. You be the sole judge. If you do not see a marked improvement in 5 days, return the course to us and your
                        money will be immediately refunded. But mail the coupon this very minute, before you forget. Surely you cannot let so positive
                        an oppor- tunity to reduce to normal weight pass by unheeded.</ab>
                    <ab>Remember, no money--just the coupon. As we shall re- ceive an avalanche of orders for this remarkable course, it will be wise
                        to send your order at once. Some will have to be disappointed. Don't wait to lose weight, but mail the coupon NOW and profit
                        immediately by Eugene Christian's wonderful discovery.</ab>
                    <ab>The course will be sent in a plain container.</ab>

                    <ab>Notable among current musical announcements is that Florence Easton, soprano. Metropolitan Opera Company, now records
                        exclusively for Brunswick. Her initial record (just released) is the Bach-Gounod "Ave Maria."</ab>

                    <ab>Musicians, critics, teachers, all will tell you the seven- test of a phonograph is in rendering "high notes," espe- cially
                        soprano.</ab>
                    <ab>Remember this when buying a phonograph, and insist that soprano records he played.</ab>
                    <ab>Note, then, how most instruments vibrate, sound "metallic" when the higher notes are reached.</ab>
                    <ab>Then hear the same records on The Brunswick.</ab>
                    <ab>Hear the full range of "high notes." Soprano High "C" in ringing intensity, without slightest "metallic"
                        intrusion--clear-toned, vibrationless! And you will marvel at difference so great in phonographs.</ab>
                    <ab>Note: New Brunswick Rec- ords are on advance sale at all Brunswick dealers on the 16th of each month in the East, and in
                        Denver and the West on the 20th.</ab>
                    <ab>Exclusive methods the reason</ab>
                    <ab>By means of exclusive methods of Reproduction and of Interpretation, Brunswick achieves perfect rendition of the so-called
                        "difficult" tones--the piano, the harp, the human voice. Methods which apply to no other phonographs or records.</ab>
                    <ab>The Brunswick Method of Reproduction is exclusively Brunswick. The Brunswick Method of Interpretation, in producing records,
                        has not been successfully imitated.</ab>
                    <ab>Hence, buying any phonograph without at least hearing The Brunswick is a mistake. And to be with- out Brunswick Records is to
                        be without what is best in music.</ab>
                    <ab>Ask your nearest Brunswick dealer for a demonstru. tion. The Brunswick plays all records, and Brunswick Records can be played
                        on any phonograph. Hear, com- pare---then judge for yourself.</ab>
