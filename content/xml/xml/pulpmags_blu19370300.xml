            <seg type="columnLine">back to the fire when it seemed that our</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Standing at the edge of another lead</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">early one morning with two companions,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I noticed a polar bear swimming in the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">open water. Ice had begun to form, but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it was not yet strong enough to bear his</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">weight. It was, however, too thick to al-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">low him to swim on the surface. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bear, therefore, would paddle along for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">eight or ten yards, apparently until he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">became tired of breaking his way through</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the young ice, then make a dive. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would swim under water for about</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">twenty" yards, then come up for air,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">breaking his way through and resting his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">forelegs upon the ice while he looked</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about. He would again paddle a few</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">yards, then dive.</seg>
        </ab>
        
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> In this fashion he finally reached pur</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">camp. He stood on the heavy floe,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sniffing, then came toward us at a leisure-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ly walk. Up to this time the dogs had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not discovered the bear's presence; but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">now, with the animal in plain sight, they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">began to bark furiously. The bear was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not disconcerted in the least by the ter-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rific uproar; his sense of smell told him</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that there was seal-meat in the offing, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he immediately headed for it, paying no</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">attention whatever to us or the dogs.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">When he was in a convenient spot for</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">ON another occasion, when we were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">returning to our base camp, some</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">four hundred and fifty miles to the south-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">our tent about fifteen yards from the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">what he thought was a piece of ice, drift- ,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing along about two hundred yards from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the tent. When it seemed to him that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the ice was drifting too rapidly, he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">picked up his binoculars to see what it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">really was. As he was focusing them up-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on the object, it disappeared beneath the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">surface--and reappeared a little nearer</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">camp. We were being stalked by a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> The three of us got our rifles, and two</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the third man stayed with the. dogs.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Apparently the bear had sighted them,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sleeping in a row on the ice, and had con-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cluded that they were seals basking in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the warm sunshine. His patience was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">remarkable. He would swim slowly back</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and forth, occasionally lifting his head a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">little to see if the "seals" were still there.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">But the dogs slept peacefully on. And</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">this in itself should have warned the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">fact, he was within ten feet of my com-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">turned a complete somersault, still</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">headed in our direction. My companion</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">again pulled the trigger, but it would not</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> They informed me that there are cer-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">When they want a drink of fresh water,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">If a hunter neglects to do this, all the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">To brace myself, I sang:</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the water. And so we must go back to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the nigh-empty tank. Our water allow-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">We must go thirsty till a rain should</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">soups too salt. We cut off buttons from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">our shirts and dungarees, and kept them</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Morn after morn we scrubbed the long</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> When that gale died, we were well up,</seg>
