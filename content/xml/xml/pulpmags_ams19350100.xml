Its mirror-like surface re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flects any celestial body whose altitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">is to be determined. This gives so nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">level a reflecting surface and so nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">a plane, that the latitude can be deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined within a few hundred feet by its</seg><seg type="columnLine">use. The surface of the ocean is very</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly spherical. The disturbances due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tides are infinitesimal, when re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferred to the diameter of the earth. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbances due to the true tidal wave,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is carried around the world by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the combined effect of the attractions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sun and of the moon, is modified</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the irregular conformation of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shore lines of the land, so that tides are</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher and lower in some places than in</seg><seg type="columnLine">others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The atmosphere includes several lay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers, distinctive and varying in thickness</seg><seg type="columnLine">through relatively large amounts. While</seg><seg type="columnLine">we speak of the depth of the ocean in</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers of feet or of fathoms, when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to the atmosphere, we speak of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in terms of miles. The layers of the per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly elastic, highly mobile air can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">defined and designated with the provi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion that they vary greatly in relative</seg><seg type="columnLine">depth from time to time. The atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere in which we live is an ocean of air</seg><seg type="columnLine">varying in height, for we measure it up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards, from six to ten miles. The ocean</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water we measure in depth or down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards. This layer of the atmosphere has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been named the troposphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is the layer of the atmosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">termed the troposphere, whose meteor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ology affects the drama of our lives.</seg><seg type="columnLine">8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Storms and temperature-changes, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seasons and clouds and sunshine are a</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of our life experiences, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">general history of the troposphere is one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of constant change. And there is one</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of similarity between our tropos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere, taking it as the ocean of air, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ocean of water--they are rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely related in their depths. The ocean</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper at its deeper portions is about six</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles in depth--the troposphere varies</seg><seg type="columnLine">from six miles to ten and a half miles in</seg><seg type="columnLine">height. And in this range occur the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteorological changes that affect our</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives. Its greatest height is at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">equator and the least height is in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">far north and south latitudes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above the troposphere a dividing</seg><seg type="columnLine">layer is assumed called the tropopause,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the change is made from the trop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">osphere to another layer of air which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stratosphere, and which has figured</seg><seg type="columnLine">conspicuously in the daily news items of</seg><seg type="columnLine">recent years. The stratosphere varies in</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperature being coldest where it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">farthest from the earth, which place is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the equatorial region. It is coldest above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warmest part of the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stratosphere has no clouds, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">rain, and intense cold. The lowest re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">corded temperature is -134° F. It may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be said to have no change in temperature</seg><seg type="columnLine">except as related to the troposphere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It appears perfectly obvious that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperature as we rise into the stratos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere, should constantly fall, following</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rule of temperature changes en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countered in ascending mountains. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some unexplained reason this does</seg><seg type="columnLine">not occur in the stratosphere. The tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perature changes in general accordance</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its distance from the earth, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost regular reduction in temperature</seg><seg type="columnLine">with increased height does not hold above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tropopause. We have never gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">very far into the stratosphere, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">records of balloon ascents lead to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">conclusion. The changes in temperature</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in the upper layers of the stratosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">arc still a matter of conjecture. We do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know when the problem will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved if it ever will be. The water sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plies the fishes' oxygen. We live by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen of the troposphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It has long been known that the tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perature of the air falls at'higher eleva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. This it does with some degree of</seg><seg type="columnLine">regularity, the higher a balloon ascends,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the higher we ascend a mountain, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower the thermometer reading will be.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But this law obtains only for the tropos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere. When the limiting or separating</seg><seg type="columnLine">layer called the tropopause is passed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">decrease in the readings of the ther-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mometer, the regular fall of tempera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture encountered in the troposphere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceases, and a layer filled with rarefied air</seg><seg type="columnLine">is reached, beginning at a height of five</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ten miles from the surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, where the temperature of highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rarefied air is approximately uniform or</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least has no change due to elevation</seg><seg type="columnLine">and is unaffected by distance from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's surface. The stratosphere ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tends from the tropopause to a height of</seg><seg type="columnLine">about thirty miles above the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fact that height from the earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface does not effect any graduated</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular change in the temperature of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stratosphere, must not be taken as mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that it possesses a uniform tempera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture in its distance from the earth's sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, in all its parts. The tropopause</seg><seg type="columnLine">varies and where it is nearest to the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">the temperature of the stratosphere over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying it is the highest. The temperature</seg><seg type="columnLine">of -76° F. for the troposphere has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">registered in the Antarctic at ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">level. Over in Batavia in the Dutch East</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indies in the tropics a temperature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">-134° F at a height of ten miles in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stratosphere has been recorded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the earth the troposphere is so</seg><seg type="columnLine">irregular in its attributes that we never</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what the next hour may bring, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are quite uncertain about the future</seg><seg type="columnLine">TROPOSPHERE, TROPOPAUSE AND STRATOSPHERE 9</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">weather. But in the stratosphere these</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncertainties hardly exist or do so in</seg><seg type="columnLine">very small degree. There are no storms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">.no rains, no clouds. It has been ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plored by one balloon to a height of</seg><seg type="columnLine">about 11% miles by standard methods.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Several balloons with human observers</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gone nearly thus far into its mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious depths. The difficulties involved</seg><seg type="columnLine">are very great--the car containing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">observers has to be hermetically sealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and several lives have been lost in these</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascensions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But untenanted balloons with self-reg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istering instruments have been sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">adrift and it is reported that in one case</seg><seg type="columnLine">a height has been registered of 23%</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles. These balloons are called sound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing balloons, and the average of 15</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles is assigned them for the heights</seg><seg type="columnLine">attained.

These regis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trations were for various phenomena</seg><seg type="columnLine">and varied greatly in their reliability.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some were quite accurate, but, as already</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted, elevations determined by baro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">metric readings are not very reliable. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments which the little balloons</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry are suspended at the end of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thread about a hundred feet in length, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">as not to be affected in any way by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">balloon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A comparatively recent system of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction for sounding balloons is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">use two balloons, one small one inside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other larger one. It was determined at</seg><seg type="columnLine">what rarefaction of air the larger one</seg><seg type="columnLine">would burst. When this occurs the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller interior balloon acts as a par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">achute and descends gently to the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its load of tiny instruments. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">method is due to Regener of Stuttgart</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the ascent of 17% miles is credited</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one of his balloons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The history of balloon ascensions is one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flotation. But it is interesting to note</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the highest elevation ever reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">by man's instrumentality was attained</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a steel projectile. The celebrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">"German guns" that bombed the city of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paris from a distance of some seventy</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles, did it by giving a very high angle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of projection to the gun. The shell in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few seconds penetrated the troposphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went on through the almost airless</seg><seg type="columnLine">regions of the stratosphere, and above</seg><seg type="columnLine">it so that by far the greater portion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the course was made through an approx-</seg><seg type="columnLine">imate vacuum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The curve followed by a projectile</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the earth, the ballistic curve by</seg><seg type="columnLine">name, is unsymmetrical due to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence of the air, whose resistance dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torts it. If there were no air the curve</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a parabola. But the shells of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guns bombarding Paris, did so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their journey in an approximate</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacuum, that they approached the par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abola in the course they followed. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been calculated that they attained a</seg><seg type="columnLine">height of thirty-four miles, or nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">one two hundred and fortieth of the di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ameter of the earth. On the eight inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe, we referred to last month, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be about the thirtieth of an inch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An interesting coincidence as it may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be termed in the troposphere is to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found in the height of Mount Everest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This is probably the highest mountain on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth and its summit has an elevation</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost equal to the minimum depth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the troposphere. And man has never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been able to climb to the summit of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant of the Himalayas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The many changes that occur in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stratosphere, its perpetual unrest, have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done much for mankind, much good and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little evil. For long years the winds</seg><seg type="columnLine">have driven machinery and ships for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, but at last have been given their</seg><seg type="columnLine">holiday from mechanical uses. Sailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessels, whose driving power was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind, are rapidly disappearing from ocean</seg><seg type="columnLine">10</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and lake; windmills are nearly extinct,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except small ones for country houses. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind, except as a possible source of</seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction in tornadoes and cyclones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceases to directly interest us, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is still working for our benefit in de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloping the beneficial weather changes</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially rain. This phenomenon of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">troposphere is in a sense the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumph of nature over man. For while</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat motors and electric motors have</seg><seg type="columnLine">displaced much of the possibilities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">using the wind, man has not yet suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded, and has naturally not even tried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to distill pure water from the salt water</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ocean and to distribute the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tillate on mountain tops to produce cat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aracts, and on many vast regions to sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply rivers and to keep lakes from evap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">orating to dryness, and to give life to</seg><seg type="columnLine">vegetation. The cataracts in the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains of Switzerland drive machinery, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in doing so utilize the energy of the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Man has striven for years to pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duce a solar engine, but every water tur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bine, large or small, is driven by the solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat and by the disturbances of the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the winds of the troposphere. With-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the heat of the sun the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged with salt would stay in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean. Even when the sun draws it up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the operation is incomplete for here the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind comes into play and blows the</seg><seg type="columnLine">humid air over the land area, where it</seg><seg type="columnLine">does its work by forming rain for man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind. Wind, water and the heat of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun working in a sort of unison are</seg><seg type="columnLine">what make the earth habitable.

Accepted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, meant that within two years</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would be given a berth in one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded Planetary Transports. Where-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, since Ban Miller's particular field</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mental activity had been news report-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and interpreting, he was now acting</seg><seg type="columnLine">as trainer to the Unlicked Cub. The Cub</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not wholly unlicked, naturally, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was inexperienced as far as this field</seg><seg type="columnLine">of reporting was concerned. Televiso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">news was a highly interesting and effec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive means of spreading the stories, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the average man did not care to sit be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore his televisor and watch the Inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">national Conference on Planetary Af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairs for fifteen all-day sessions, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">further, he didn't have the time. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conference was scheduled to run fif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen days, and the nations were spoiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a real, good battle-royal. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a battle-royal, too, because the In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dustrial Committees were fearing a vio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent depression, and realized that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the choice of fifteen million unem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ployed in the United States, and pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portionate numbers elsewhere, or a war</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which would make the fifteen million</seg><seg type="columnLine">and proportionate numbers unproduc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive consumers in the armies of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. Further, the war was indicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by falling profits. The customers needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good reason before they'd accept a</seg><seg type="columnLine">price boost. A war would be ideal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then incidentally of course, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">real enmity arising from the Planetary</seg><seg type="columnLine">Affairs Commissions. For nearly three</seg><seg type="columnLine">centuries, the Interplanetary Transporta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion Company had had practical control</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ownership of the planets. Interplan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">etary had gotten off to such a flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">start, it had simply bought up all com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petition at first, and since then no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been interested in starting a rival</seg><seg type="columnLine">company. The only government of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Planets had been the Interplanetary's</seg><seg type="columnLine">own Executive Office. Now however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had arisen considerable feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">on earth, that some nation had a definite</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim to the control of those planets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They'll argue," Miller explained to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cub, "on the basi3 of the claims</seg><seg type="columnLine">made way back in the late 1900's and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the early 2000's. The United States has</seg><seg type="columnLine">an iron-clad claim on Mars, really, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause it was an all-American crew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">took old Laurie's ship up there. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">her navigator, and her captain, hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to be of French descent, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">France has laws to the effect that no</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchman can become a national of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other country. Therefore, the captain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he claimed the planet for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States had no right to do so, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">further, the second ship to make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossing was actually French, and also</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed half the planet. But Germany</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed out that neither ship had fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">explored the planet, and not until their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship made the crossing in 1989 was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete survey in detail available.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therefore they claim about a third of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now the Jovian Worlds were ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plored by nationals of all the Terrestrial</seg><seg type="columnLine">16</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">countries, and Io was explored by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">American-born Martian.

The tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">increase in the available energy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it possible to throw thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">workers out, and still maintain produc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, but it had brought a great deal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble, till the British-American war</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gotten rid of the excess, and brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canada into the Union. But it had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beneficial effect of opening up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Major Planets and Venus and Mercury</seg><seg type="columnLine">to colonization, so that a great many of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the remaining semi-plehbs had left earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made things quieter. Anti-gravity</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come almost simultaneously, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely opened the system to coloniza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, but by that time the Interplanetary</seg><seg type="columnLine">Union got nasty, and wouldn't permit</seg><seg type="columnLine">any further emigration from earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wallowy passed through the door of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Peace Palace with a determined wad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle. He might be able to induce the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heinrichs and the Derriers to join him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in declaring war on the Interplanetary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That would solve the unemployment</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem, and might get them a little sat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isfaction on the score of Interplanetary's</seg><seg type="columnLine">superior attitude.

He had intended calling on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Karl Heinrich as the first speaker, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he discovered to his annoyance that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montgommery of Interplanetary Union</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted the floor. He ignored him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">called Heinrich to speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think," said Montgommery inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupting, "that it would be wisest to hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">me first.

Jon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was a mechanician, a Plebh of the 'A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">class' in consequence, and fairly free to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">roam, his blue garb a protection from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Polshin guards. Jon had seen and en-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tered these deserted passages, when a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mysterious short circuit in a power cir-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cuit had to be located. Far back in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Deserted Passages, the power line had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">long since been dead-ended, and never</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">removed. A fall of stone from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">passage roof had shorted it. Bruce was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">determined to see them. He had told</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Don he would.

Once, his father had told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, the streets had moved, and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">could ride on them, but that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped, to discourage the wandering</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Plehbs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His father had been apprenticed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man who knew the story of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">city of N'yak of long ago. Then, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">father had told him not only the Pol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shins had surface homes, but even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Plehbs had lived above ground. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">because it was cheaper to create artificial</seg><seg type="columnLine">light from atomic power and maintain</seg><seg type="columnLine">air conditioning, than to maintain both</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these and also buildings that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather constantly wore down, had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Plehbs been moved below the surface,</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the rocks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jon had even been to the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes, to fix power lines leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Polshin homes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Bruce walked more slowly as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came at last to the edge of the city.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were few people in the streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">here now. The Polshin guards were far</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart, and the light-tubes were scanty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bruce looked down the corridor he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">following, and saw where the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended. There was no Polshin stationed</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, for it was a little side-street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where no people lived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T TURRIEDLY Bruce scuttled be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the lighted zone, and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. No Polshin had seen him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on, stumbling in the dark, afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">to light his hand-torch. Something</seg><seg type="columnLine">tripped him suddenly, and he fell with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little cry of fear. Quickly he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">his light on it. It was a strange, white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lattice work of rounded bars. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only when he saw that it was an outline,</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his own size, and that, draped</seg><seg type="columnLine">over it was the rnetal-cord belt such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wore, that he realized what it must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be--a skeleton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He almost went back. But he looked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">24</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw there was no light-tube beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">this skeleton, and determinedly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">started on. He wondered how many-</seg><seg type="columnLine">more might have come this way, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">died.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the super-developed sense of di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection he had acquired from many walks</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the lighted part of the city, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt no fear of getting lost. Instead he</seg><seg type="columnLine">Went on and on, his light-tube glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He passed long rows of deserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwellings. Then he came to a section,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the like of which he had never seen. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor had grown wider and wider as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he advanced, with incoming passages</seg><seg type="columnLine">adding to it. Here at last he came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great Cube, far greater than Cube</seg><seg type="columnLine">Center in the part of the city he knew.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the center of the Cube was a build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, not made of the universal granite,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grey and cold, but of white stone, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">marble had he known it. It was utterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">different from anything he had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen, beautiful and clean and white. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spread light of the tiny, but wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully powerful hand-light, he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimly see the graceful columns and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof. That was something he had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen before, in this weather-less place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not know that this was a copy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greek architecture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Breathlessly, excited as he had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been before, he looked around him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole Cube was lined with various great</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass windows, far larger than he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever seen before. They were dark now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lonely little heaps of rubbish lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind them, he could not guess their</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cautiously he made his way toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beautiful white building. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubbish on the stone floor of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cube. Over it he picked his way with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aid of the little light-tube and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the broad, foot-worn steps of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">library. This library was very old, even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew that. He knew more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">most children of that thirty-second cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tury civilization would have known. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could read the inscription above the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even though it meant little to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"INTERPLANETARY LIBRARY</seg><seg type="columnLine">FOUNDATION/' Foundation he un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstood. His father had taught him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">read, for Jon Lawry, being a mechan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ician, had to be able to read meters, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other things, as had his predecessors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so the art of reading had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed down among the mechanicians.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bruce knew foundation only as a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">base one put machines on. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">around for the machine, and wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">what kind of thing it could have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had been set on this beautiful struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">INTERPLANETARY meant nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. He did not know what a</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet was. Library meant as little, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Plehbs had forgotten libraries and</seg><seg type="columnLine">printed literature almost entirely, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little they knew was the simple tech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nical material they needed. Actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bruce's mother, Marta, had taught him</seg><seg type="columnLine">reading more than his father had done,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though his father had begun his in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction, for Marta was a worker in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chemical plants. She had nearly half</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen books, books on thin metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">plates, worn and broken now, for they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were some four hundred and fifty years</seg><seg type="columnLine">old. These were the only books Bruce</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew. Libraries were unheard of among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Plehbs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bruce stared at the great bronze</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors. Cautiously he pulled at one. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not open. The grill of the gate was</seg><seg type="columnLine">far too fine-meshed for him to slip</seg><seg type="columnLine">through, and there were no windows in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the building. Inside he could see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth layer of grey dust on the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone, and long racks, a series of great</seg><seg type="columnLine">tables, and here and there a low desk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was very dark, save where his light</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CONTEST OF THE PLANETS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">25</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">touched it. He wanted very much to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he turned his attention to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lock. It was steel, bright, rust1 ss</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel, far too well made to be opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">his efforts. Perhaps somewhere there</seg><seg type="columnLine">still existed a key for that lock, but no</seg><seg type="columnLine">man on all earth could have said where</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might be. But Bruce was a mechan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ician, his mind was sharp, and trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">to mechanical and electrical thoughts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Confidently he examined the door. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned, and made his way back</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the trash and litter of the Cube.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hunting, he finally found what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted, a bent piece of metal some six</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches long. Fearfully he made his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to the door, stripped off his single</seg><seg type="columnLine">garment, and wrapped his hand and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light-tube in it. Then with the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand he removed the tiny glowing gas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube from the device, and carefully in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted the bent metal, carefully pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tected with some mouldering cloth- In</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment he had located the thinnest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the metal bars of the grill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sudden groaning hum came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his light-tube as he made the contact, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">popping and crackle of sparks, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shower of incandescent metal fell on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloth-wrapped hand. Some burned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare body--but the grill-bar parted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again he applied his light-tube, another</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar gave way. Three more bars he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused. Then he stopped, and replaced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gas-tube. It didn't fit well now, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the resistant light-tube was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what burned, and it didn't glow very</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly any longer, for the charge was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly used. He knew though that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would bum satisfactorily for another</seg><seg type="columnLine">four hours, and then he would have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">emergency cell left for half an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TUGGING, straining with all hi*</seg><seg type="columnLine">power, he pulled the broken bars</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside. He crept inside, and looked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">about him. Now he could see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stacks, and with a soft intake of breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">he realized they were books. Books in</seg><seg type="columnLine">such quantities as he had never imag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ined! Rapidly he went to them, and read</seg><seg type="columnLine">their titles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "T*h-e D'e-v-e-l-o-p-m-e-n-t O-f I-n-</seg><seg type="columnLine">t-e-r-p-l-a-n-e-t-a-r-y C-o-l-o-n-i-z-a-</seg><seg type="columnLine">t-i-o-n." He spelled out. But he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what it was. So he took down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">book, and looked at it. Then he put it</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, realizing he did not know anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it at all, and looked at other</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three hours later his light was grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing very dim, and he realized he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurry back to the lighted ways soon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Regretfully he turned away, and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">homeward. But he determined that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Library, the meaning of which he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, was to be his secret, shared only</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Don Wade. They would come</seg><seg type="columnLine">back here, and bring fresh light-tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them, and they would learn what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in all those thousands of books.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Why, they might learn even what</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the Burners give off their silent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot flame endlessly, and the great surg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing currents. Nobody knew that any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, but Jon Lawry had said, ''They</seg><seg type="columnLine">have forgotten. Once men knew, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have all forgotten now. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">books are lost. They must have told</seg><seg type="columnLine">once upon a time. Once, men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiser than now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maybe these books told even that!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DOT STEEL was the third per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son to enter the library after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seven centuries of deser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.

By</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he had read some of the books in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that library, and what had been a child's</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret from the first day, became even</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of a secret. And from them he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned the secrets of the machines Jon</seg><seg type="columnLine">repaired blindly by rule. They were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, just as to Don Wade, an escape. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the books they left the grinding labor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 3340 and went back through time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the days when earth was great.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An even deeper secret it was as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced to adolescence. Then, as their</seg><seg type="columnLine">apprenticeship approached an end, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">maturing minds began to realize more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more fully the significance of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. They realized the true inherit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance of mankind. Bruce had studied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">technical books, both because they lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the field of his work and because</seg><seg type="columnLine">in them lay his interests. He knew how</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Burners worked, splitting the atom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and releasing the protons and electrons</seg><seg type="columnLine">in flying streams, to give off the tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous currents that were the life-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood of their civilization.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wade had studied the historical books,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had gathered more and more a true</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture of what the human race had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been. But one problem was left in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. What had happened? Why had</seg><seg type="columnLine">men fallen so, and fallen so completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">and abruptly? In 2695, dozens of books</seg><seg type="columnLine">were placed on the shelves. In 2697, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last book had been placed there. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">library records ended in 2703, What</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brought about this tremendous and</seg><seg type="columnLine">abrupt fall, from a vast civilization</seg><seg type="columnLine">that spread to every planet of the sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem, to a tiny shrunken thing that could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not maintain itself at its high level for</seg><seg type="columnLine">even one brief decade? Had men been</seg><seg type="columnLine">afflicted with some titanic system-wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">plague? Why was there absolutely no</seg><seg type="columnLine">record of this tremendous, world-shak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing change?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Don, more than Bruce, was absorbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this problem. Don was the student,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the sociologist. Bruce was the scientist</seg><seg type="columnLine">To Bruce came the sheer, thrilling ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultation of intellectual brilliance as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">read of the scientific achievements of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Old Days. When men had come face to</seg><seg type="columnLine">face with an absolutely impassable</seg><seg type="columnLine">boundary--why they had simply dodged</seg><seg type="columnLine">under it or over it or crept around it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing had stopped man then, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed. In the greatness of earth, Man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sought, and found the secret of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy of exploding atoms. One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things that had given Bruce the keenest</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy was the infinite subtlety with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">men had attacked the problem of X-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays. No substance could be ruled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines so close together as to produce a</seg><seg type="columnLine">diffraction grating such as was used in</seg><seg type="columnLine">light study. So--man had used the nat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ural, regularly spaced crystal-molecules</seg><seg type="columnLine">in substances as his diffraction grating</seg><seg type="columnLine">X-rays could not be reflected by a mir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror, or concentrated by a lens to form an</seg><seg type="columnLine">image. Yet man had used crystals to</seg><seg type="columnLine">focus X-rays to make pictures'of things</seg><seg type="columnLine">too minute to be caught by light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Bruce did not wonder at it, it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly natural to him, but he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to understand and follow with ease</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deepest thoughts of those greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinkers of the Old Days. Why shouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">he, he would have thought? They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, he was a man--so why not?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">/TA HE Planets had done better by</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, in leaving her, than they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed.

His fifty-three years of utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">unrestraint showed in the bleary, pig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, in the flabby, fat face and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flabby, fat belly. He waddled when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked, and his voice was high-pitched</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unpleasant.

Bob Steel was a Master of Direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and a class A Blue. And he hated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Polshins with as deadly a hate as</seg><seg type="columnLine">did Don Wade. With Wade he began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to read the old books, and to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had been before. He quickly appre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciated the mystery and romance of them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And--their possibilities for revenge, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for reinstatement of the Old Days. Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jon read the books, and with ecstatic joy</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned again the secrets forgotten by</seg><seg type="columnLine">men for more than six centuries. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">reveled in knowing.

Soon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, they had been killed off, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">died out, or by intermarriage with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weaklings, both in mind and spirit, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last revolutionary tendencies had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">stamped out. The far-reaching spy sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem of those days had died out with it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gradually the televiso-system fell into</seg><seg type="columnLine">decay, and failed utterly. The telephone</seg><seg type="columnLine">system was simpler, needed less intel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ligence for its operation, and was main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained because the Polshins needed rapid</seg><seg type="columnLine">communication at times of emergencies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Masters were connected by tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone system, but that had, at first been</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched with the greatest care, lest it</seg><seg type="columnLine">be used for plotting. Finally even this</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, in 3350, there was no check on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Plehbs, because there seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">no need for it.

Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they hoped to turn their giant eye out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Mars and Venus, to see what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to the civilization of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Planets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Does it require so huge a machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">for shorter ranges, such as looking at</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth-scenes ?" asked one of the dele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">O," Bruce replied. "I can, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">will, make much smaller replicas</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the important parts of this machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">for that purpose. But this machine is</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended for viewing the planets. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">make that possible, I had to mount an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormously complex clock-work deviee</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow the planetary motions. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">instance, to view a city such as Thanton</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Callisto, I have first to neutralize</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's daily rotational movement, than</seg><seg type="columnLine">to neutralize the effects to Callisto's</seg><seg type="columnLine">daily rotation, her orbital rotation around</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jupiter, and Jupiter's orbital motion</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the Sun. All of this requires</seg><seg type="columnLine">an exceedingly complex apparatus. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">already now, sets similar to the primary</seg><seg type="columnLine">view-apparatus are in machine-produc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. We had to cut dies for that, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is what took so long. That, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the development work. But the tech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nicians are now working on a similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">device which will have an illimitable</seg><seg type="columnLine">theoretical range, and a practical range</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would permit glimpses of life on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Athena. However, this device will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">but two feet square, and three inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick. For viewing scenes on earth, it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">will be fully capable of anything we</seg><seg type="columnLine">need.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The big apparatus is ready. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage there is ten by ten, and I will put</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it life-size human images, with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten thousandth real solidity. The subr</seg><seg type="columnLine">jects which are viewed will feel a slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrical tensity, but absolutely nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that will disturb them in the least.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have adjusted the controls to view</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old city of Shkaga.

This was, actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">and really, the first time the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a whole had been tested. The tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmed, a low humming echoed momen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarily from the speakers. Then--ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruptly, solidification was complete. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stage there was a portion of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">building, fading off into misty unreality</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the edges of the focus. Dari? rub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bish lay at its base, and on the pavement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were no people on the stage; all</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dark, apparently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bruce rapidly condensed the image.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The building shrank, and the whole of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great Cube was visible, dark, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubbish-heaped. "There are no men in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this section. It is dark here, evidently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The image is lighted by our lights here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In reality, it is utterly dark. I will shift</seg><seg type="columnLine">the focus." The setting blurred, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shimmer and change, flashes of solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock obscured everything, then suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an instant a flashing human figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared and was gone. Instantly Bruce</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed the setting back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a passage, lighted evidently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Half a dozen human %ures in grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">garb slunk disconsolately down the rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor; at its end was a Polshin guard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the deep orange the Polshins of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shkaga wore. Bruce raced down the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridor with his settings, branched to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger one, down that, and finally reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small Cube. There were more people</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CONTEST OF THE PLANETS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">41</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">here, Plehbs in grey, and dark fed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark blue.

Don Steel had</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared for this request. Not for</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing had he studied mass psychology,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he had searched for many minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">on BrUce's original model of the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">before finding the scene he knew would</seg><seg type="columnLine">most quickly and effectively rouse the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. Suddenly the stage was a gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den, a magnificent garden of flowers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrubs. It was night, but soft lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a dirft illumination. In the garden</seg><seg type="columnLine">were scarcely a dozen figures. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">young Polshin men, an older Polshin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and three Plehb girls in a group. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">older Polshin Was bleeding freely from</seg><seg type="columnLine">five long gashes across his fat cheek.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Otie of the Plehb girls Was bound to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of young, stout trees. The Polshin</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a heavy whip, and was beating at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her body with all his fat strength. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole raiment Was coldred by criss-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross streaks of blood, she hung loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her bounds, perking feebly to each</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroke of the whip. Low moans came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the speaker, and soft cries from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two other Plehb girls, held by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two younger men, watching the scene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abruptly Bruce cut the dials sharply</seg><seg type="columnLine">across. A rumbling roar sounded from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speaker a9 there were flashed on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage masses of tumbled, jagged rock,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">green trees and solid mountain*. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry cry mounting Up from the audi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence drowned out the sound, as the scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was established at last in a swaying</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest of piiies.

"I did not pick</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the Polshins at first, because I feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sUch scene. We did not haVe to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see in order to know. We have heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">all this. I think it would be best if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">used now the more complex features,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and viewed Mars. That is the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem really. Have the planets suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered a like fate?

Tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">spots appeared on the very slowly turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing globe, spots of black and glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. "Those are lights on Mars,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bruce said, his voice tense. "Lights shine</seg><seg type="columnLine">as lights, even in this device." The</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface came nearer, toward one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those shining clumps of light. It grew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, as it grew, the rotation of Mars</seg><seg type="columnLine">became evident. The scene was turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">past them.

The buildings towered slim</seg><seg type="columnLine">and graceful, ships flew through the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">around them, and into them. Only here</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no perspective. Bruce altered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the setting, and the whole city, in min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iature, was on the stage.

People,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of gaily dressed people it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed, flowed along on the moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways. They were smiling, laughing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy. A scene such as no Plehb had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever seen. Brisk, clear sounds came</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the speaker, the sounds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices mingled faintly, the hum and rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vast business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Civilization didn't fall there!" gasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don.

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was specially equipped, and very few</seg><seg type="columnLine">had access to it without his special per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission. There, surrounded by a maze</seg><seg type="columnLine">of extraordinary apparatus, the scientist</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be found at almost all hours of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day Or night. Most prominent, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the huge laboratory, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the multiple battery of forty gargantuan</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">X*ray tubes, built at an enormous cost.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These were arranged in a near circle.

The whole, linked to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether end to end, could be operated as</seg><seg type="columnLine">one mighty unit--the wonder of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific world. All around was an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posing array of mechanical and electro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnetic apparatus, mostly of a kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and design altogether new to the eves of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ordinary engineer or laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">worker. Huge generators were hum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming their song of power. Another</seg><seg type="columnLine">special feature immediately arresting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eye, were the two 30-foot spheres</seg><seg type="columnLine">of highly polished metal, which served</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the negative and positive terminals</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an enormous electrical field.

But that was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a beginning, for this mighty power</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be gradually stepped up to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">even vastly greater voltage by means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tremendous circular electro-magnetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">field, which could accelerate the shoot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing protons to hundreds of millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">volts--a power never before dreamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of in laboratory science.

Further and further went</seg><seg type="columnLine">the switch. ... Ten million volts! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty X-ray tubes glowed fiercely with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their surcharge of power.

That is, he had a far keener eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">to politics behind adequate finance, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on which side the University's bread, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to mention his own, was buttered, than</seg><seg type="columnLine">matters pertaining to mere learning. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was therefore extremely careful of any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in the way of deeds, or even mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconventional utterances anywhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the realm of the institution under</seg><seg type="columnLine">his jurisdiction, whether by student or</seg><seg type="columnLine">teacher, that might offend the delicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensibilities and still more delicate pock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">etbooks of the influential donors and</seg><seg type="columnLine">keepers of the school. Certain it is, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a rumor among those who pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessed to be in the know, that the dig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nified Dr. Lorman owed his high posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, to an extent few appreciated, to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-connected political association rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than to his profound educational or</seg><seg type="columnLine">other abilities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T)E that as it may, the good Dr. Lor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was thoroughly dismayed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite put out by the recent disastrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire which had wrecked the newest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finest building on the campus, and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncomfortably close to destroying some</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. At the same time, to say the</seg><seg type="columnLine">least, he was quite annoyed at the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinguished physicist who had been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">careless, if unwitting and unhappy cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the disaster. More than once before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since taking office, it had occurred to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and now came to him with even</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater certainty, that the physicist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">granting his great distinction, had all</seg><seg type="columnLine">along been allowed too much, altogether</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much, of the lately restricted Uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versity funds for those never-ending and</seg><seg type="columnLine">costly experiments of his. Could there</seg><seg type="columnLine">be any doubt of it now? The school</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed a new gymnasium, for one thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">much more. There was a crying need</seg><seg type="columnLine">voiced by a large and vociferous major-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity for a new and larger stadium. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">52</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">all, he had his obligations to the student</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, not to mention the alumni. Be*</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides he doubted if the Professor, Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidering his age, could accomplish much</seg><seg type="columnLine">more anyway. And even allowing for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">utmost charitable view, what did the</seg><seg type="columnLine">professional work of one man mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">alongside the larger needs of the school</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a whole? And since he had for a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time intended to cut down the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor's huge laboratory appropriations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">right now was as good a time as any,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without arousing too much antagonism</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the part of those more scientifically</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Furthermore--and this Was of prime</seg><seg type="columnLine">importance, despite the man's renown-*</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not like, to put it mildly, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor's entirely too open and critical</seg><seg type="columnLine">views on Such public matters as religion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">politics, industry, and society in general;</seg><seg type="columnLine">views radically at variance with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own. There was great danger of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">open expressions contaminating the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloping mind of many an innocent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Student, whose parents Certainly had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right to expect protection of their off-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring against Such radical doctrines. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">the learned Professor, personally such</seg><seg type="columnLine">an admirable fellow, would only stick to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his grubbing, scientific experiments, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in itself, aside from the expense, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be so bad.

Again, regardless bf the modem</seg><seg type="columnLine">holly*balloo for science and still more</seg><seg type="columnLine">science, Dr. Lorman could not restrain</seg><seg type="columnLine">a secret belief that it was somewhat over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">done; the scientist Was getting alto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether too much attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dear Professor; won't yOu have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a seat?" the President began in his sauYe</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, his florid face wavering between</seg><seg type="columnLine">a polite Smile and a veiled frown.

He was di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rected to the "new wing" which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been added a few years before, and im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately ushered into the spacious</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Presidential Hall."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he entered, he was surprised to</seg><seg type="columnLine">note the large number present besides</seg><seg type="columnLine">the regular members of the Cabinet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everyone's eyes turned with ill-concealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity in his direction, rendering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually reticent scientist extremely self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious. Miss Harkness shook hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him very warmly and introduced</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to some of the notables.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few minutes later the President</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself came in and the session com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menced in earnest It was the most his-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torical, and in many respects perhaps the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most dramatically strange meeting of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kind ever held.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tomlinson listened silently to the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liminaries. He knew he was signally hon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ored to be called to such a notable gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering. And yet, he could scarcely repress</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a feeling of frustration, of bitterness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thought came to him. Why do so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many people wait until the devil him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self is upon them before they will listen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reason? There came over him a long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for his departed great teacher. Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Mendoza been alive, he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure, the threat would have received the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper attention long ago, and the dread-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful emergency might never have come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end of an hour's discussion pro</seg><seg type="columnLine">and con, Tomlinson was called upon to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak. When he stood up, all trace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervousness and bitterness was gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A dramatic silence fell upon the room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was plain, he was the master.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">MR. PRESIDENT, members of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cabinet, Friends: "I am in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed glad to have the honor of address-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing so distinguished a gathering, to par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">take in deliberations so vital to the life</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our nation. At the same time I feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">constrained to say that I speak with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy heart. For nothing that I can say</seg><seg type="columnLine">or do, nothing that we can all of us say</seg><seg type="columnLine">or do, will avail to alter the fatal course</seg><seg type="columnLine">of circumstances." Then he went on to</seg><seg type="columnLine">state the case as it stood from the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to the fatal stage to which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been allowed to go. Continuing:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The neglect can be laid at the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only of the public leaders but of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rank and file of those high in office,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who, no matter what their other qualifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cations, have proved themselves woefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">short of imagination, ignorant of im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant facts of science, lacking even</seg><seg type="columnLine">in true intelligence." Governor Sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ons of New York coughed and scraped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet. A crimson spot appeared on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hammond's cheek.

A way must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be found!" His powerful and command-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing personality, idol of the nation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathed an infectious confidence that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seldom failed. "I am prepared to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">before Congress at once and demand un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">limited funds to combat this great evil</seg><seg type="columnLine">which has overtaken us.

The doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor has been called too late. All the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money in America will not suffice to</seg><seg type="columnLine">undo what has been done. If all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">capital and labor of the entire world</seg><seg type="columnLine">were conscripted, even if all mankind</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked as one without stint or let-up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it still would not avail. It is dreadful to</seg><seg type="columnLine">admit, but the reasons are simple: We</seg><seg type="columnLine">could never build the necessary equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment fast enough and powerful enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Right now, this very second, there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">pouring out of that center of disinte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gration jn the Catskills more energy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">many times more, than all the energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and power we could muster against it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all the science and engineering re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sources known to man.

A momentary expression of</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief on the part of his listeners gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to bepuzzlement.

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, Tomlinson, working day and night</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a corps of able colleagues, made</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous progress, and was well on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way to devising a practical engine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose motive power was to come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the controlled annihilation of tiny quan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tities of matter.

Large</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces of radioactive matter thrown to</seg><seg type="columnLine">great distances started new centers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">infection. The steady desertion of New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York, Albany, New Haven, Philadelphia</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other cities which had been going</seg><seg type="columnLine">on for over a year, now gave way to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad stampede north and south, via land</seg><seg type="columnLine">and air and sea, which quickly depop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ulated a wide swath of the eastern states</seg><seg type="columnLine">for hundreds of miles up and down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only a providential downpour of rain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual in amount and duration, cooling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the overheated atmosphere, prevented a</seg><seg type="columnLine">holocaust right then and there.

A tight lid was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamped on to keep as much as possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">the full news of what was transpiring</seg><seg type="columnLine">from reaching the general American pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lic.

Perhaps the idea of other</seg><seg type="columnLine">worlds is a myth, and all our efforts will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be in vain. What then?

Why plunge the world into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">frenzy oi construction, only perhaps to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be followed by disillusionment and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreadful reaction that will come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">futility?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To this Tomlinson and his supporters</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied: Even if the quest for a habitable</seg><seg type="columnLine">world should prove unsuccessful, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing to lose by the immediate</seg><seg type="columnLine">construction of vast fleets of space ves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sels. Improvement Would thus follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">improvement. At any rate, if a habitable</seg><seg type="columnLine">new world should be found, as there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was every reason to hope, then the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediate construction of sufficient ves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sels to remove the earth's population</seg><seg type="columnLine">was imperative and might not otherwise</seg><seg type="columnLine">be completed in time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is remarkable to what depths of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stubborn foolishness some men will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried by ignorance, demoralization and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the defeatist feeling.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">personnel, besides a trained crew, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded a company of the most promi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nent scientists and specialists in many</seg><seg type="columnLine">fields.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The goal decided upon was the planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars, the ancient planet of war, but now</seg><seg type="columnLine">a welcome sight in the heavens. Mars</seg><seg type="columnLine">was chosen as the objective of the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">expedition because of its then being</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest in its orbit and because of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent similarity except in size to</seg><seg type="columnLine">its sister planet the earth. Just then at</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposition near perihelion, which occurs</seg><seg type="columnLine">every fifteen to seventeen years, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruddy planet was shining with extraordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary brilliance and only about 35,000,-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">000	miles distant. A long journey in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed !

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">initial rate of speed was easily regulated</seg><seg type="columnLine">due to the enormous power available.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The take-off, therefore, though swift,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was comparatively slow, thus avoiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the danger and discomfort which a too</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden release would bring.

Much of it was due to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of astronautical experience. Ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curate charting of the abysmal depths of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space is a new science, highly compli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated.

A similar fate had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come within an ace of snatching Tom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">linson's expedition also. Although his</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel had succeeded in landing safely</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Mars, it was not without a severe</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash, due to trouble which had unex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectedly developed with the control sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem. Fortunately, and partly due to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tomlinson's supreme genius, their equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and preparations were such that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were able at last to effect the neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary repairs in time; although not until</seg><seg type="columnLine">after several months of agonizing un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the safe return of his expedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, however, it was now possible to iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">out most of the serious unlooked for</seg><seg type="columnLine">defects in the new science and art of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space ship construction, as well as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">better to avoid the errors incident to</seg><seg type="columnLine">astral navigation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TOMLINSON reported that Mars</seg><seg type="columnLine">was habitable, although far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">being an ideal planet for the needs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a transplanted mankind.

Second, the water supply,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though ample, was badly distributed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of it confined to the frozen polar</seg><seg type="columnLine">caps, and would require an immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of engineering before it could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be made available on the needed scale.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rainfall was very scanty and practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">non-existent over large portions of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet. The air was very thin and dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">and much like that on the highest moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains on earth. Then there were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrifically cold winters, about twice as</seg><seg type="columnLine">long as the terrestrial (the Martian per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iod of revolution at a mean distance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">141 y?. million miles from the sun is</seg><seg type="columnLine">687 days, although the daily rotation, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">24 hours and 37 minutes, and the axial</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclination is practically the same as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were of course the peculiar draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">backs due to its small size, only 4,216</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles in diameter, and the still more pe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culiar conditions incident to its small</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass, which is only about one-ninth that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of earth. But Tomlinson was overjoyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find there was life on the ruddy</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet, although it proved to be of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very low order and of vegetable type,</seg><seg type="columnLine">confined chieflv to certain narrow tracts</seg><seg type="columnLine">*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">traversed by the summer-time streams</seg><seg type="columnLine">fed from the polar caps. All in all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet was not a very inviting world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was something. And under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern lash of necessity it is surprising</seg><seg type="columnLine">what can be done. If nothing better</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned up, the red planet could be made</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do. For the atmosphere, even if</seg><seg type="columnLine">rarefied, was fairly invigorating and for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuntely adaptable to man's nature.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of water, an ample supply could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">achieved with the aid of art and science,</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite the severe conditions imposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by most of the available supply being</seg><seg type="columnLine">impounded in the polar caps. Much gen-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eral preparatory work, of course, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be required.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOT content, however, Tomlinson</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately announced his plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">for another and greater expedition to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus. The cloud-enshrouded planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">would shortly again approach inferior</seg><seg type="columnLine">conjunction and be at its nearest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His plans for this new expedition</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on a much more ambitious scale.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It comprised six of the largest and new-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est type atomic-power driven rocket-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships, which incorporated all the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideas gained from his previous voyage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without the defects which had proved so</seg><seg type="columnLine">disastrous to all the others and which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was well nigh fatal to his own. Alto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, over eight hundred men departed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this great expedition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And successful it proved to be. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, Venus, the Evening Star, at near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est inferior conjunction--only about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">24,500,000	miles away--proved an easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">conquest. Five of the expedition's fleet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of six vessels spanned the distance in</seg><seg type="columnLine">only fifteen days, landing safely in</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect condition. The sixth unfor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunately was lost in a meteoric storm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that with experience could</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the future be avoided.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Venus, as explored by Tomlinson, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed itself to be a raw, young world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifeless and uninhabited. This was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first sight very disappointing. But after</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer study the planet was found to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have tremendous possibilities in its favor</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a future homeland. For, outside of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life itself, which had never developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, the planet contained within itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically all the essentials for life as</seg><seg type="columnLine">required by terrestrial creatures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost the same size as its sister</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet the earth, or to be exact 7,575</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles in diameter, with a somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger proportion of ocean covered sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face and large copious watered contin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ents, it offered, according to Tomlinson</seg><seg type="columnLine">84</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and his colleagues, a fit world for col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onization; far preferable to the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">and arid Martian planet. To be sure, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere was heavy and quite below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oxygen content to which human be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings were accustomed, but far from de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficient. With time and the agencies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">transplanted vegetation and human art-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ifice this could be brought up to the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sired content. Adaptation, too, if need</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, could be relied on. The temperature,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, due to its nearness of 67,-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">200,000	miles from the sun, was hot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">humid, but this was considerably com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pensated for by the thick envelope of</seg><seg type="columnLine">moisture laden clouds which prevented a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great deal of the killing heat from reach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the surface. An important drawback</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the excessive amount of carbonic</seg><seg type="columnLine">acid gas, but not dangerously so, it could</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fact be turned to advantage as con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducive to a rapid and luxuriant growth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of transplanted vegetation.

He could scarcely be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve that all this had actually happened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed more like the substance of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">realistic dream.

They had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of architecture, the use of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metals, the domestication of animals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons and a knowledge of military</seg><seg type="columnLine">tactics and, most important of all, an al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phabet and the power to put thought into</seg><seg type="columnLine">89</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wave upon wave of the men from the inner lands charged against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrier--only a few lived to return again to the main body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">90</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">form fully elaborated and indestructible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For centuries our ancestors on earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">had struggled with these problems be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore they had mastered them, then to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">retarded for countless years, when our</seg><seg type="columnLine">world had been lost in a maze of super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stitions and unnecessary wars. In this</seg><seg type="columnLine">region of Mercury there is no definite</seg><seg type="columnLine">night or day, which is perhaps the rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son why superstition plays no important</seg><seg type="columnLine">part in the lives of these people, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">night is the time of mystery, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind of man conjures pictures of evil</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirits and evil deeds. I have often</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that this is the reason that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is no counterpart of the evil spirit in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the religion of these men, nor anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is similar to Hades. We have never</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to alter these beliefs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During these months I had insisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a patrol far beyond the limits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley. The King had laughed but</seg><seg type="columnLine">consented, even Hughes was inclined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe that I was overcautious, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had persisted and obtained this guard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in the last few weeks had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">much more efficient, mounted on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tireless troads. For the same reason I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had insisted upon the speeding up of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">completion of the high voltage barrier</seg><seg type="columnLine">that surrounded the domain. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to believe, that, bested in a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirmish with only a few of their avail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able men in action, the men of the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">of darkness would leave us alone. I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not believe this. I had seen their chief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ig, and knew that he had far more in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligence and ambition than the average</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dar, also I had seen the look of en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">during hate that he had bestowed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill and me, when he had parted from</seg><seg type="columnLine">us on that night so long ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As was my custom, I had emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the terminals of the city one day</seg><seg type="columnLine">and climbed to the mountain top to</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch the signals of the guards upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the range to the eastward.

I marveled at the speed of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast and the natural skill of the rider.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fast as a swift horse would travel they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, unhindered by the rough ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the bad light.

To men un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar with their customs, as Bill and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I were, this might seem wrong; to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people of Sen Ver it was but natural.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They have done so since the beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">and do not draw the lines of sex very</seg><seg type="columnLine">finely.

"I will scout their posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion from the air, they must still be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great distance away. I will report to you</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the passes of the first range of moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains, since it is agreed that we shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">await the Sen Lev there and attack from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that point."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Happy landings, partner," said Bill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned to board the ship, to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dianna waiting for me there. A brave</seg><seg type="columnLine">and handsome picture she made as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood beside the outer port. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad in the conventional garment of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vereans, with a purple band around her</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaxen hair, from which arose a plume</seg><seg type="columnLine">of three purple feathers, insignia of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher officers. For a weapon, she had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short officer's sword in a golden scab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bard, Smiling she extended a slim hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wish you happy landings, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">David,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the spur of the moment, forget'</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting that this was a princess, unmind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful of the fact that I was an outsider,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a thought of anything except</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I loved her more than any one I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever known, I drew her to me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed the rose-petal lips to mine.

I was not sure that she did.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Realizing finally that I could not stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">this way forever, I tore myself away</seg><seg type="columnLine">and entered the ship. As we rose swift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly into the air I could see my loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">one below, sword raised in salute.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swiftly we sped across the valley and</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the mountains beyond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Electric Soldier</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OVER the plain beyond the range</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mountains we came upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy.

My worst fears were realized.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was no mob of beasts but an army</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men with some semblance of order.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were encamped below us and huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">fires were blazing away. As I studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">them through the glasses I could see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly all of them were armed with long</seg><seg type="columnLine">bows and many with swords. The sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought home the fact that men are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultimate artists in mimicry. A few short</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks Hughes had been amongst them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still they had learned from him to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire. On one occasion only had they seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow, arrow and sword in action. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">agile brain among the mass had regis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered the value of these and put them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">use.

A long</seg><seg type="columnLine">and heated discussion followed, Hughes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I both being in favor of returning</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once, but we were over-ruled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dianna and her following.

Hughes is such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man." Bill was a West Point man, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been an officer in the army. This sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">warfare was new to him, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since on earth, for many years, all wars</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been won, or lost, for the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">part, in the air. However he was well</seg><seg type="columnLine">versed, as an army officer must be, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">methods of ground warfare, the distribu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of supplies, care of the wounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all the many details of a campaign.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was to be guerrilla warfare, fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">from behind trees and rocks. Our plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">of action was to meet the enemy at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">base of the range. The mounted men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed with most of our supply of</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy pistols in addition to their regu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar equipment, would attack all along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the line of battle. My crew, using the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big guns of the ship would cover the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack. Any of the opposition that</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke through would meet the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of archers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the valley below, the enemy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread out in an encampment about</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve Yurgs in length.

The first action would begin at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the wooded slopes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our thousand of cavalry advanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">first to meet them and from the air I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave the signal to attack. Simultaneous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly we opened fire with the big guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard the ship. The mounted troops,</seg><seg type="columnLine">using Indian tactics were strung out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a long line, always moving along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enemy front. The fire from the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was supposed to clear a path for them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arrows of the archers to take care</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any that they missed. I knew that, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first burst of firing did not demoral-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ize the forces of Sen Lev we were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a long hard battle, the outcome of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was really doubtful, as we did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have enough ammunition for the energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifles to carry on a sustained attack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The supply that we had brought from</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth was nearly exhausted and we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not as yet found time to make more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The leaders of the nation had expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">some attack by their enemy, but had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that it would come so soon nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">by such a large force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The enemy had been well trained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As soon as men began to fall and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that our attack was on, they made</seg><seg type="columnLine">use of their natural ability for camou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flage.

The ultimate de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cision, on their part, I felt, rested with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one man, Ig.

I came to a small intersecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley from which flowed a trickle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. Thinking that I would find a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring back in the shadows I entered. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very thirsty and longed for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink of cool water. Most of the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Mercury is very warm, except when</seg><seg type="columnLine">its source is underground or in small</seg><seg type="columnLine">springs.

The Nimar</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruler and his following had refused to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accept our explanation of our presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Nimar soil, because their books</seg><seg type="columnLine">have said that there is no other land than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nimara.

This seemed to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of a hospital and a very poor one</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that. That these men held us in great</seg><seg type="columnLine">respect was evident from their attitudes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those able to do so crowded around Bill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">asking him many questions. We learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">much of their history and mode of living</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a short time.

Some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these men,-Imar is the name of the race,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had been captured in the lands of dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and brought here, a greater num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber had been born in captivity. All hated</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feared the men that they slaved</seg><seg type="columnLine">for, but none seemed to have the resource-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fulness to organize a successful revolt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although outnumbering their masters. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of sporadic attempts at escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been made within the memory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zuth, but the results had been so dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">astrous that they were at the point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete submission. I wondered why</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leader had thrown men, such as Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">amongst these, but could find no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation than that he rated us as</seg><seg type="columnLine">very inferior in intelligence, or else was</seg><seg type="columnLine">secure in his belief of the infallibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Nimar defense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A plan was forming in my mind. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had numbers, if we could learn the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret of the Nimar armor or of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon that they used, we might stir</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and direct a revolt. Bill and I talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">this over for some time and finally he</seg><seg type="columnLine">addressed the men gathered about us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You say, men of Imar, that you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">never been able to escape from the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hold you.

Our masters, realiz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing this, make of it a sort of a reward</seg><seg type="columnLine">for faithfulness, as they consider it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill's plan in short, was that all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Imar should be informed that a break</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be made sometime in the near</seg><seg type="columnLine">future, that, under penalty of being killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by their fellow slaves, no mention was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever to be made of this plan except at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time when we were locked in quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters for sleep, at which time we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that no inquisitive ears would hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">our conversation. We planned to dig</seg><seg type="columnLine">our way out of our quarters, capture</seg><seg type="columnLine">our guards by surprise, and armed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their weapons and armor, to fight our</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to the land of darkness. The suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess of our plan was dependent upon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">our attacking the guards before they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to bring their weapons into play,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until a number of us were armed, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, our armor protecting us from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas, we planned to kill any others with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own weapons, or, failing that, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat them to death. We counted a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal on the fact that the guards, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">when actually in combat, leave the hel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">met of their suits open, and that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could put them out of action before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could prepare to fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Imar argued over this long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heatedly. Most of the older men con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered it as impossible, but the younger</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaves were all in favor of some sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of action. They had lacked a leader.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zuth, a powerful influence, was hesitant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">undecided.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You say," argued Bill, since he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished to win Zuth over, "that all may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be killed? It is only a living death that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have now. There must be many of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, who, like Zuth were born far away</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the light of the stars, and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom the first years of life are remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered as free ones. Then there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">lash to sting your back when you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">so exhausted that it seemed that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not go on, you had only to kill the</seg><seg type="columnLine">game to feed yourself and your family,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the worry of finding a cave suitable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sleep in. To men of spirit, freedom</seg><seg type="columnLine">is worth dying for if necessary." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally persuaded Zuth that the plan had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very good chance of success and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">won him to his views.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had talked a long time. An Imar</seg><seg type="columnLine">posted at the door shouted to us that</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaves were being driven in and that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course guards were with them. Soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">after that the hundred men in the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">room were herded into line and</seg><seg type="columnLine">marched to another long low building,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where we were fed. Much to our sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise, the food, though coarse, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholesome and there was plenty of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apparently the Nimar were crafty</seg><seg type="columnLine">LAND OF</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TWILIGHT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">103</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to realize that a creature,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether man or beast, can do more work</seg><seg type="columnLine">when well fed. No conversation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed while eating and the table was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringed by a number of guards with</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons. There was no time for con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation in any case since a man must</seg><seg type="columnLine">grab what he desired quickly. We won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered at the haste displayed and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered the reason, when we were or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered away before my companion and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had found time to satisfy our hunger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We were hurried back to the first .build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and it was barred from the outside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was thankful in one respect, in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">no move had been made to separate</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hughes and myself. I would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly handicapped had our captors</seg><seg type="columnLine">done so, since I knew only a few words</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tongue. Excitement was at a high</seg><seg type="columnLine">point after our guards had left. Zuth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his companions were gravely dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussing the ideas that Bill had given to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We learned that the Imar women, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom there were not many, as compared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the males, were kept in a separate sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the town. Each day they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">transported to the city proper where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they performed the menial tasks of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">household. Meetings between the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">sexes were few. In spite of their mode</seg><seg type="columnLine">of living the Imar were much further</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced in civilization than the wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of the southlands. Living in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tact with a civilized scheme they must</seg><seg type="columnLine">of necessity absorb considerable of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme. Conversation soon ceased in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the building and they all slept. We were</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon to learn the reason. That sleep was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sleep of complete exhaustion. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim light of the following day we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">routed out by the guards and herded</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more to the mess-room. Bill and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I, taking our cue from the experience</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the previous day, wolfed our victuals</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same as the others, managing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusion to fill our stomachs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Conveyances were lined up outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for us and we were soon in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foothills of the mountains. The gang,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we were in, were mining copper</seg><seg type="columnLine">which existed here in a huge vein of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">native metal. For five hours we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">compelled to swing a heavy hammer</seg><seg type="columnLine">drilling the holes that other slaves would</seg><seg type="columnLine">fill with explosive. It was man-killing</seg><seg type="columnLine">toil without a moment's rest. If the pace</seg><seg type="columnLine">slackened for a moment, we felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lash of the guards great whip across</seg><seg type="columnLine">our backs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'T begin to see the hand of the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain of our guard in this," I said. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice that the other drilling crews are</seg><seg type="columnLine">not rushed at the pace which is forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I imagine that we will be continually</seg><seg type="columnLine">harassed," answered Bill, "since that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nature of the cruel man wherever he</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were allowed fifteen minutes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which to eat a midday meal. I was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhausted that it was necessary for me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to force the food down my throat but</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing that I would be in better shape</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I ate something I did so. Then we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven back to our work. I noted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other drilling crews were changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that my friend and I were given</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same assignment. The latter half of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day passed somehow. We w'ere in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best of physical condition but unused</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hard physical labor. I was thankful</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed when the signal for a halt was</seg><seg type="columnLine">given and we were marched to the cars</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started on our return journey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the seat beside us wTas a young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Iman who opened conversation as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as our vehicle was under way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Nimar intend to kill you by</seg><seg type="columnLine">work," he said. "I overheard two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guard talking in Niman. Some of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand their language, though they</seg><seg type="columnLine">know it not.

Should the labor be not more</seg><seg type="columnLine">severe than to-day we can get along."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They have put you to the hardest</seg><seg type="columnLine">work that there is. As you may have ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served, in the other gangs they take turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">about and only work one-half the day at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hammer and drill. We did not be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve that you could last the day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can last many days," Hughes</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied, "but as soon as the Nimar dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover this they will find other means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting rid of us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The routine in the days that followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">was much the same as the first. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were fed and locked up each night in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut that contained the physically fit men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The aged one, Zuth, I saw was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same shanty. He told us that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been returned to the mining gang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have had word of the she that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was captured with you," he said one</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. "She has been taken by one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wives of Duneen, as her personal</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave. She will be safe from any Nimar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except perhaps, the ruler himself. Being</seg><seg type="columnLine">more comely than the Imar women her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistress will take pains to protect her</seg><seg type="columnLine">from all other Nimar."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every night for one hour we tunneled</seg><seg type="columnLine">under our prison walls. One thing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our favor was the fact that once the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors were barred our guards never</seg><seg type="columnLine">molested us, unless the covers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted from the lights, which was never</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted to happen during this time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One month from the day of our cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture word came in from all sources that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Imar were ready for the break. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">me it was pleasing news. I swung the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammer almost joyously that day under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glowering, baleful glare of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two hours after we had been checked</seg><seg type="columnLine">into our building. I pulled away the</seg><seg type="columnLine">false support that held up the scant six</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches of soil that remained between us</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the outer air. Very carefully we</seg><seg type="columnLine">scraped away this layer until a hole big</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for egress had been made. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">poked my head above the surface and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a hurried look around. The guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">on our side of the building was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappearing from view around a cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner of the structure!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Surprise Attack</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH a low spoken word direct-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the others to follow, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped my club and went out</seg><seg type="columnLine">after him. I reached the corner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building, around which he had disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared, and in the shadows I awaited</seg><seg type="columnLine">his return. As he came into view, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet open, I recognized him as one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the many who had crossed my back with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lash, leaving scars that would re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">main with me for many years. Seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, he reached for the visor of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet, to close it, but he never had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance, the heavy club, painstakingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashioned from the poles of flooring, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scended upon his head crushing the skull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two remaining guards to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">building were stalked, surprised and</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed before they could give an alarm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill and I left the disposal of the corpses</seg><seg type="columnLine">and recovery of weapons and armor to</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the others and ran to tfi5"</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest adjoining building. As we made</seg><seg type="columnLine">our attack there, the slaves inside came</seg><seg type="columnLine">through and joined us, and so we</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread our conquest throughout the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vicinity. As we collected numbers, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtained armor and weapons from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slain guards, I called some of the lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers to conference, Bill said to them:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Men of Imar, the other white man</seg><seg type="columnLine">and myself, being swifter, will run</seg><seg type="columnLine">LAND OF</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TWILIGHT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">105</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">down and kill any that may get free.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You, men of the inner lands, must bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brunt of the attack."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The buildings were invariably guarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by three men. Sometimes one, in a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases two, of the guards would escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slaves who are very slow of move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. Our earth-trained muscles en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abled us to run these down before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could escape, and clad in their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">armor the weapons did not harm us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our forces were now large enough so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that some sort of campaign could be fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed. We called the council together</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more, Zuth was chosen, by them</seg><seg type="columnLine">as their spokesman. Bill gave him his</seg><seg type="columnLine">instructions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very soon the Nimar from the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">city will be here in force, if they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been warned already. Our plan of</seg><seg type="columnLine">action is to lead them away from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">headquarters, on to the open plain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There we will destroy all of their con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veyances and prevent them from re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning to their city. Pick a strong force</seg><seg type="columnLine">that shall remain concealed near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridges. After the Nimar have crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">they shall come forth to prevent any</seg><seg type="columnLine">from returning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We went on, and soon came to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">section of the town housing the Nimar</seg><seg type="columnLine">women. This section was not nearly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">large as that which held the men; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Imar women were few in number.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quickly we went through their quarters</seg><seg type="columnLine">but no where did I find Dianna!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill questioned one woman. "Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">has the strange girl gone?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"She must still be in the city upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill. I will get you a woman who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quartered in the same hovel with her."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Do so at once! There is no time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Soon the woman put in an appearance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They keep the white one at nights</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. I do not see her often but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">tells me that she has to entertain the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nimar."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The slave town was in our hands now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and but for this circumstance we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to leave it. Bill and I called the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Imar together. They were all near as</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been strict orders that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be no looting, no disturbance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rouse the upper town. Now the order</seg><seg type="columnLine">was changed, we called for a score of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men to follow us to the regal quarters</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I believed we would find Dianna.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The response was not as spontaneous as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would have been, if we had been deal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with Vereans, who would gladly</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow either of us through fire, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though in justice I must say that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissenters were greatly in the minority.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last we picked a score of the young-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er, more daring, only to find that none</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the upper town. They had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been bej'ond the river in their cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tivity, but we soon found a woman that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been there many times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Twenty minutes after we cross the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge, create as much noise as you can,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until you know that the entire Nimar</seg><seg type="columnLine">town is aroused. Retreat to the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, leaving men to blow up all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridges but the one. Those men are to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait for our raiding party here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We sallied forth, a small band against</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great town. Our advantage lay in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that nearly all of the populace were</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep. We had no means of knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">what policing system prevailed here. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had traveled a considerable distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">when one of our party spied a sentinel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Imar have sharper eyes than their</seg><seg type="columnLine">masters. The party came to a halt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I will circle around him,'' I said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill, "since, if I am seen, less notice will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be taken of me. Your great stature</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes you a. marked man in any com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man was standing partly in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow of a building that faced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street. He had not moved since we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighted him, but the Imar told us that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not apparently directing his atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">106</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to us. I went over into the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">street and hurried along its length till</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had him in a position directly between</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself and our party. I was returning</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly towards him when suddenly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">started in my direction! Twelve feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">above my head was the railing of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">porch. I leaped in the air with my arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">outstretched. I was again thankful for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lesser gravity of Mercury, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped the railing and hauled myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">over! Tensely I waited as he approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">but nothing seemed out of place to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he sauntered along. When he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly underneath I launched myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him kicking out hard with my feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I neared the bottom of my leap, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give the blow the necessary power. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell to the ground--dead. The body had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly ceased to convulse, when Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up ready, as ever, to take part</seg><seg type="columnLine">in any trouble that might develop. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, the episode had passed so swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">that no one had been aroused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We signalled to the rest of our party</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come forward so that we might con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinue on our way. Behind us, at the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the river, pandemonium broke loose!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heavy explosions sounded and fire broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in many places, as the Imar, follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing our instructions, wrecked buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the river front.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the shelter of a huge storehouse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we heard the alarm sounded in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets about us. In a very short time, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw, from our hiding place, the Nimar</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces marching en masse, to the settle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment across the river. I climbed to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">point on the roof and made as accurate</seg><seg type="columnLine">a survey of their numbers as was pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible.

Above the chamber was a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pound microscope of peculiar shape,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a double eyepiece and a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">keyboard mounted on its side. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were other peculiar things about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">miscroscope; for instance had one been</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to examine it, he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed that all the illumination was</seg><seg type="columnLine">provided through a microscopic aperture</seg><seg type="columnLine">underneath the chamber, and that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light was artificial, provided by a mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cury lamp of some type and filtered</seg><seg type="columnLine">through two lenses before it reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hole. Had Atwar been in a talka-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive mood, which he never was, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have explained, that the purpose of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenses was to increase the magnifying</seg><seg type="columnLine">power in a peculiar system of his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Atwar was quite proud of the affair</seg><seg type="columnLine">for from bottom to top it was his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">invention and the thing he proposed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do with it, of course with the help of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistants, would undoubtedly astound</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific circles if he succeeded, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew he would succeed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While he made a minor adjustment</seg><seg type="columnLine">with two right hands, he prepared a pad</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pencil with a left hand and reached</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for a bottle of small transparent crys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tals with the other left hand.

A sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond later he was back bringing with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">a group of thought-readers who were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">read Atwar's mind during the experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and to accurately record his im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressions at first hand; this made it</seg><seg type="columnLine">equivalent to having four separate people</seg><seg type="columnLine">perform the experiment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Silently Atwar bent over the micro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope, two huge eyes focussed upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage, a third was on the paper pad on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he would write the results of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment, while the fourth eye gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight at the group of thought-readers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order to facilitate their task, for it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the eyes that the mind is most</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily read. With deft six jointed fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers he picked up a pair of tweezers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed a minute crystal of the substance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was in the bottle, upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage.

Slowly materializ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out of the blackness, a dull reddish</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball about the diameter of a cent ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared, and about it spinning at great</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed were minute specks, like grains</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dust in the sunlight, or was it only</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes? His fingers adjusted the knobs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the red ball grew to the size of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small orange, covering the whole stage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He slid the stage slightly to one side</seg><seg type="columnLine">and three of the specks came into view,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now as large as pinheads. By careful</seg><seg type="columnLine">manipulation he counted eight, it was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had thought; now he must finish; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">committee met at seven and he wished</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have a report ready. He made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid calculation as to what wire the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atom must be over and pressed a but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton. There was a flash that half blinded</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, but that was all; he had miscal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culated.

A num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber thought of establishing some sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a counter-current, but it was pointed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was not known whether or not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"destroying flame," as the religious fan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atics had named it, was electrical or</seg><seg type="columnLine">not, and that, if it were such, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not enough electrical power on earth to</seg><seg type="columnLine">successfully neutralize it.

Then all the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">went into action, and by that statement</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is meant that twenty billion tireless</seg><seg type="columnLine">robots started to labor, day and night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to complete the terrific task.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything was in readiness by Sep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tember eleventh and the world was wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, waiting breathlessly for the result</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the test of the forlorn hope of</seg><seg type="columnLine">humanity. From points all over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe huge structures, like the long range</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns of a bygone day, were pointed sky-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, and a network of some sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipes completely checkered the globe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">An anxious world was waiting its</seg><seg type="columnLine">time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE eighteenth of September was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fatal date. At three-thirty in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the afternoon the blue flash streaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the solar heavens, heedlessly an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nihilating Venus and Hailey's Comet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its course and struck the sun. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a huge flash, the like of which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never been seen before, and the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed into hundreds''of flaming pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">which flared up in the solar heavens each</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little star in itself. Throughout the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire universe there was a jar as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars readjusted themselves to the loss</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their brother and things started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the instant the flame had struck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Dr. Granstedt had thrown the</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch which was to save or ruin the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. From the vast network of pipes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lay over the world had arisen huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds of gasses that dimmed the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosion of Sol to all human eyes. Slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in great billowing clouds, they went up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards, until they seemed to merge into</seg><seg type="columnLine">one vast mass that completely sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded the atmosphere.

An</seg><seg type="columnLine">experimental rocket was projected; up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">up it went until it reached the ceiling;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then it seemed to strike something solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in another instant it was falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to earth, its steel head buckled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impact of a collision. Dr. Granstedt</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled for the first time in many</seg><seg type="columnLine">months; it was as he had hoped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned; the gases, no longer warmed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heat of the sun, had solidified and</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed a solid casing around our earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her atmosphere.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not so hard to reach its new sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if in preparation for the catastrophe</seg><seg type="columnLine">from time immemorial the Sun had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been rushing toward Vega at an incon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceivable speed and now the earth under</seg><seg type="columnLine">its own power completing the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">lap of the trip for it was toward Vega</seg><seg type="columnLine">the independent planet was traveling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It took nearly a year to complete the</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey but then, as if prearranged, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth fell into an orbit about the star</seg><seg type="columnLine">and took for itself a place where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat from the second sun would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">adapted for human life.
