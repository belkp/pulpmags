Maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hadn't killed him. The doctor said</seg><seg type="columnLine">one punch would never have done it.

Let your brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">manage the ranch. Vince knows as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it as you do. You could make</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough in the ring in two years to buy all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the raspberries in the world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney said shortly, "The ranch needs</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But that wasn't all there was to it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three of them knew it. Left to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self at the ranch, Vince wouldn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised a sweat, much less raspberries.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vince was the older of the Nolan boys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but without Barney he was no good for</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything. Half the time he was no good</seg><seg type="columnLine">for anything, anyway, and doggedly Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney kept things going.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That had started when they were kids.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vince was ten, Barney was eight. Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man Nolan was a tough Irishman, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two boys had to do their chores every</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, or else. The "or else" hung behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kitchen door and stung like blazes</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it snapped across your backside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vince had been as little fond of chores</seg><seg type="columnLine">then as he was now, and the minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two kids were out behind the barn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vince would light into Barney and beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bejayses out of him until the younger</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy, stubbornly fighting back the tears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did the chores for both of them. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just fine for Vince, but there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one thing he forgot, and that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney's red-Irish temper. Barney fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">back until he was bloody, but Vince was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bigger and stronger, and it always ended</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same way with Barney lying flat on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face with Vince astride his shoulders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinding his face into the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      OW will ya chop that wood? Now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      will ya fetch up the water? Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">will ya pitch down the hay?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Vince always gave him a final cuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the ear, even after Barney nod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ded, grinding his teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The end of it came abruptly, with vio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence and blood that wasn't Barney's.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vince was supposed to go down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river pasture and bring up the Nolan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">three cows, but the minute they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the barn he slapped Barney across</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the back of the neck and grinned:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get gawn, half-pint, and no backtalk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For emphasis, he planted the broad of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his foot against the seam of Barney's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pants and sent him sprawling to his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knees across the stony ground. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the indignity of that contemptuous kick</seg><seg type="columnLine">that blew the lid off Barney's temper. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed up a handful of stones and flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">them into Vince's jeering face. For a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment there was an awful silence, then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the blood spurted, Vince let out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shriek that could be heard the entire length</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Puyallup Valley, clear to the base</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mt. Rainier in the chilly distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vince clapped his hand to his face, ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">in howling circles, then lit out for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">farmhouse, yelling at the top of his lungs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had reason to yell. A sharp stone had</seg><seg type="columnLine">split his right eyeball as if it were a grape.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was never even a prayer that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of that eye could be saved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old man Nolan wasn't fooled for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute. He knew what had been going on</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them, but he had the idea it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">toughen Barney to fight his own battles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but with Barney's mother it was different.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vince was her first born, her favorite, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she never let Barney forget for as long as</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour what he had done to his brother.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And neither did Vince. That was Vince's</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. That was the cross he nailed Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney's red hair and fierce blue eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave the clue to the hot temper that burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside him, but from that day on he kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lid clamped so tightly on it that some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times you could see him shake from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of it, but he never let go. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance at his hard, leathery face would</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you that here wasn't a man you could</seg><seg type="columnLine">take liberties with.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And no one except Vince had seen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety blow off that temper until Barney's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight with the Canuck, Dupre.

Ev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erything had let go at once that night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only Goldie Goldstein would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">brash enough to mention that fight to Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney, but Goldie was notorious for step-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping on people's toes. And he was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one in Tacoma who didn't know why</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney took care of Vince the way he did.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wouldn't have understood it, anyway;</seg><seg type="columnLine">ONE FIST</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his reaction would have been a disgusted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Aw, nuts!" That was the way Goldie was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said cheerfully, "Tell you what,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney.

Only a dope</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have talked that way about Vince</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of Barney. "Hold it, Barney," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleaded. Then, as his quick ear caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scurry of footsteps on the stairs, he add-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed warningly, "There's somebody com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney stopped at the corner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk, his face tight. The door flew open</seg><seg type="columnLine">and little Maxie Mahler darted into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. He looked at Barney and panted;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Henrouille's are after Vince!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney whirled. "Where?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maxie gasped, "The gin mill near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blue Mouse Theatre.

Sammy Sloan</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked bitterly at the empty doorway then</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached out and slowly tore up the papers</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney had just signed. He swore monoto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nously and wearily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Another good fight up the rainpipe,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he scowled.

I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen it happen before."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sighed and let the paper scraps flut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter into the wastebasket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BARNEY" strode into the gin mill and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barkeep gave him a frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance. The customers were huddled down</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the end of the bar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney snapped, "Where'd they go?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The barkeep shook his head and said</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly, "I dunno, Barney. Vince lit out</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the back when they come in. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't hear no fight outside. Maybe he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney turned and ran out. He ran the</seg><seg type="columnLine">full six blocks to where the Model A was</seg><seg type="columnLine">parked. He didn't hesitate. Vince would</seg><seg type="columnLine">head for home. He always did when there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was trouble, and four Henrouilles on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prod meant plenty of trouble. They were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WAS IRISH!	7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">French Canucks, fiery and reckless, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were a million of them in Tacoma.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney wondered angrily which four of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them Vince had tangled with. Or why, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as that went. The Model A roared</seg><seg type="columnLine">east out of the city, along the ditch-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Puyallup River. The moon was bright on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snowy crest of Ranier in the high dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance, but Barney saw grimly under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dusty ribbon on unwinding road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He bounced into the yard behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house and cut the lights. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snort in the fields behind the raspberries</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a wild, clattering crash of underbrush,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bony white shape, madly galloping. Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney swore. One of these nights they'd have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get together and hunt down that damn</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse. It was running wild and starving,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripping down fences. Some damn fool in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of shooting it had turpentined it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now it was worse than ever. It scared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pants off the women.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the horse was forgotten in a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment as Barney ran into the dark farm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, calling, "Vince! Vince! It's me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney." But the rooms were silent. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit his lip and lighted the lamp in the kit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chen. Someday when they had enough mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ey ahead, they'd have electricity. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced toward the corner beside the sink.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The guns were still there--the rifle, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shotgun, the .44 hanging from the nail</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its belt and holster. That alone told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him Vince wasn't in yet. Vince would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have grabbed for one of those right away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He lit a cigarette and flipped the match</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the coal scuttle, then went out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned against the side of the house in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark of the porch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was there only about five minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">when 'ft heard the muffled roar of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truck and saw the headlights stabbing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. It swung in at the end of the fence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounced over the hump and slid to a stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a spray of flying gravel. Four men</seg><seg type="columnLine">spilled from both sides of the cab. Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney caught the glint of a gun barrel. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">flipped his cigarette over the rail and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed himself away from the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. He stood at the head of the steps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thumbs hooked in his belt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Someone yelled, "There he is!" and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">four of them surged across the yard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was Leon Henrouille. So it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">FIGHT STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that gang. With him would be Pierre, Art</seg><seg type="columnLine">and maybe Paul--the gang that worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in the lumber camp, the tough ones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yelling, they ran to the foot of the steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and stopped. They stopped so suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the two behind tramped on the feet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two ahead. In the shadows, Barney had</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like Vince. They didn't want any</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of Barney. They stood scowling; as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped to the edge of the porch and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's going on?" he asked evenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's that gun for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leon glowered. "We want to talk to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vince."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go on home and take your gun with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind about the gun.

Alone, Vince</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never had faced the Henrouilles, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Barney there he stepped boldly out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and said in that cocky voice of his,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go ahead and talk to me." He laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A growl rose from the four men</seg><seg type="columnLine">grouped at the foot of the steps.

He caught him full in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mouth with a straight left, and buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right in his stomach as the Canuck</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back on his heels.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the biggest in the Puyallup Valley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he got top rates for them at the can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nery.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller berries were called canners and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went into jams or jellies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sammy climbed out of the car as Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney straightened up and wheezed across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yard, shooing off a belligerent gander.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know why I'm doing this for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Barney," he complained, "Don't ask.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You never do nothing for me but come</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the Arena whenever you need a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little dough to fix the farm."

Sammy saw the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">temper raging behind his eyes, but Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought it down as he always did when</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was something concerning Vince. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw down the hammer and nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right." he said between clenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth. He took a breath and held it.

"We heard there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were jobs in the lumber camps around</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tacoma."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney grinned.

I called him on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone right away. Barney'll be back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">face the rap, I said. You should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard him. The air was thick with mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zoths."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going back, Vince."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure. Sure you are, Barney. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">not right now. Right now they'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">crucify you. Sammy said, tell Barney to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait till after the election. The Henrouilles</seg><seg type="columnLine">are on the wrong side of the fence this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. With the Henrouilles out, you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">get a fair shake in court. And anyway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leon aint dead yet. They're gonna do</seg><seg type="columnLine">an operation on him. If he pulls through,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're in the clear, see? Sammy says he'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">write to you general delivery in Newark.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now let's get aboard and stay there till</seg><seg type="columnLine">we sail."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney said hopefully, "Sammy said</seg><seg type="columnLine">that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't worry, Barney. Sammy'll keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">things under control. Just wait till you</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear from him, that's all." He patted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney's shoulder and his grin ran lightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his right cheek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney got the 8-12 watch with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third mate; Vince was with the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate on the 12-4, and the third ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">seaman, a kid of seventeen hired at dock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, was given the 4-8.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The decks were piled high with stacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lashed lumber, but Vince got per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission from the Chief Mate to rig a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small ring on the poop deck. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly room to spar, but when the weather</seg><seg type="columnLine">became warmer and the seas smoother as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they sailed southward, Barney and Vince</seg><seg type="columnLine">put on the gloves everyday. Vince was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard to spar with because of his dead eye,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Barney had always to work to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left, but in no time at all Barney found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself with more sparring partners than</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew what to do with. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new one every day when the deck work</seg><seg type="columnLine">was done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Despite the situation in Tacoma with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Henrouilles, Barney was at peace with</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. He didn't have to worry about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vince. He had always looked after Vince,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now there was nothing to worry about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing could happen until they got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Newark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first the third mate had been very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly, but his manner toward Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">had cooled rapidly until at last they</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely exchanged a word through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark hours as Barney stood at the wheel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring fixedly at the yellow light of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">compass in the binnacle while the mate</seg><seg type="columnLine">paced the bridge from port to starboard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching for lights ahead. The mate spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">only on the half hour when Barney had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach up and sound the bells. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a break at four bells and Barney was</seg><seg type="columnLine">given ten minutes off to go down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">galley for a cup of coffee that tasted as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it had been brewed from dried liver,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the beginning the mate had always</seg><seg type="columnLine">said in a friendly voice;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Time for the smorgesbord, Nolan. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">take over." The mate's name was An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dresson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now he merely grunted, and shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered Barney away from the wheel after</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had struck the four bells. His hostility</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unmistakable, but Barney was feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">too good to think much about it. He en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">joyed the long, silent hours on the bridge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifting his eyes occasionally to watch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, blue Pacific ground swell, or to watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the play of dolphin at the bow or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift, cutting fin of a following shark</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for spilled garbage, or just to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand there and look up at the velvet</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowl of jewelled sky and feel the life of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the freighter under his feet as the heart of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engines beat against the soles of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. In fact he did not even realize that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mate's attitude toward him was</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged with the electricity of hostility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blowoff between them came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night before they anchored on the Pacific</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the Panama Canal. The old tub</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ploughing peaceably along through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long swells, listing just a little to starboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">--not enough to count--and the air was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as smooth and caressing as a blonde's arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">around your neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UNTIL darkness fell--the sun went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down like a fried egg in the skillet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sea--the mate paced the bridge with</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry, staccato steps. He was young, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than twenty-five, if that, and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stern, Scandanavian sense of right and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong. He felt very strongly about every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">OISE FIST WAS IRISH!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">13</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped stiff-legged outside the egg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yolk light of the binnacle and thrust his</seg><seg type="columnLine">square hands deep into his pockets and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said harshly;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See here, Nolan, I want to ask you</seg><seg type="columnLine">something. You're a professional ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice had a cutting edge and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">knifed through Barney's reverie. Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up with a start.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's that?" he said, "I'm sorry, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't hear you, Swede."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the beginning, in friendly comraderie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had called the mate Swede, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate had called him shanty Irish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mate barked, "You say 'sir' when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you talk to me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney grinned. "The hell I do. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't the Navy." He still thought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate was joking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mate asked nastily, "Do you want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be logged for insubordination? You</seg><seg type="columnLine">call me Mr. Andresson, not Swede."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney blinked, but still grinned. "Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir!" he said with amused emphasis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Answer my question!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sorry, sirrrrr, but I didn't hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">your question."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you a professional? That's what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want to know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A professional what?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fighter, Nolan, fighter! You know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I'm talking about."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney didn't know what he was talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. He glanced at the compass and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned the wheel slightly to hold the</seg><seg type="columnLine">course steady.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I fought some in the ring," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But I'm not what you'd call a profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought so," the mate said with satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faction, "That's just what I thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's the explanation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney wras no longer amused. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate's edgy voice had aroused his in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flamable temper. "Explanation of what?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he demanded. His hands tightened on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spokes of the wheel. Temper. That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had always gotten him in trouble.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Temper. His fingers relaxed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Pm sorry, Swede," he said more</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly. "What's bothering you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andresson's square, hard face moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the feeble light of the binnacle. "Can</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you lick me?" he demanded. "I been in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring, too. Or maybe you won't take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance on somebody that ain't a push-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Swede weighed a hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ninety, Barney was one-seventy-two. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrugged good-naturedly as the flood tide</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his temper receded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Probably not," he said amiably, "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">got weight and reach, and that I fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a ring don't mean nothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Scared?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I'm not scared!" his temper bub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled again, "What's on your mind, any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way?" A hot spot deep inside, deep where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he lived, began to glow. He felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat of it rising behind his eyes. "Dam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mit," he said hotly, "stop hinting around</seg><seg type="columnLine">and get it off your chest!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mate stood squarely before the bin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nacle so Barney could see him. Andresson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">young face was as hard as saddle leather.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You and your brother," he said harshly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been taking the crew over long</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough. You hear me? Long enough. I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">been watching you back there on the poop</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck every night. Sixteen ounce gloves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pillows! They might just as well expect</seg><seg type="columnLine">to knock you down with a feather duster."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"So?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You and your brother have been clean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up. Ten bucks to get in the ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you they have to pay, fifty bucks</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'd get if they can knock you down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not out--just down. Sounds easy, but it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a laugh, ain't it, Nolan? A big laugh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That bunch of clowns couldn't knock a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good professional down if they hit him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with capstan spokes. You and your</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother haven't left a dime in the deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew or the whole damn black gang."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chill that prickled down Barney's</seg><seg type="columnLine">back told him that the mate was telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the truth--that Vince had been to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the crew, that all those willing sparring</seg><seg type="columnLine">partners had just been suckers--suckers</seg><seg type="columnLine">at ten bucks a throw. You could trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vince to have an eye out for the easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">buck. Knock him down! Those free-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging comedians couldn't have knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a wooden Indian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was still that soft, rotting</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot in Barney--no matter what Vince</seg><seg type="columnLine">did, it was Barney's fault. Vince wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">14	FIGHT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have been like that if he'd had two eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">like everybody else, if he didn't have that</seg><seg type="columnLine">damning black patch over his right eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">socket, if he could but have faced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world squarely instead of having to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">his port side to it continually. A thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that could gnaw at a man's soul, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had gnawed at Vince's, who had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deformity through no fault of his own,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had a deformity because of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother. His brother, his own brother--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney said dully, realizing that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely defending Vince, "Nobody made</seg><seg type="columnLine">them box with me. They took their</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances. The odds should have told them</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was damn little chance of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">winning. We didn't pick their pockets."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mate said sarcastically. "The hell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you say!" then grimly, "I talked to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain about it. He wanted to stop those</seg><seg type="columnLine">little boxing bouts on the poop deck, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I talked him out of it. I talked him into</seg><seg type="columnLine">letting me put on the gloves with you</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow night. Just a friendly exhibition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolan. He thought it would be good for</seg><seg type="columnLine">morale for the crew to see you flat on</seg><seg type="columnLine">your back for a change. What do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, Nolan--or do you have to ask your</seg><seg type="columnLine">shyster brother first?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney said, "Don't worry about me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll be there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Andresson nodded and, without another</seg><seg type="columnLine">word, walked to the end of the bridge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At seven bells Barney went aft to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">focsle to ready Vince for his watch. Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">seamen were playing rummy on one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lower bunks, but Barney noticed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there wasnt any money up. They watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">him silently as he reached up and shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vince's shoulder. Vince sat up imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately. He hadn't been sleeping. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been lying there pretending because the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew was giving him the same silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">treatment they had given Barney. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned at the door, thumbed his nose at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three penniless card players and fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed Barney out to the deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Crummy bunch," he grumbled, "I'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad when we get to Newark."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Me, too." Barney said nothing about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way Vince had taken over the crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">or about the scrap he was going to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the third mate the following night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He left Vince in the galley with a cu^</seg><seg type="columnLine">of steaming coffee, and when he climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the bridge, the second mate was</seg><seg type="columnLine">already there in earnest conversation with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the third. As Barney took the wheel, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second mate said abruptly;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's off. There isn't going to be any</seg><seg type="columnLine">bout."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The third mate growled, "The hell it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second mate swung around. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you want to do--lose your ticket?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded fiercely, "The Old Man'll break</seg><seg type="columnLine">you if he finds you getting beat up by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">focsle bum."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I won't get beat up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's a chance you're taking.

Barney and Vince went up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the poop deck as usual after chow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The crew lounged around the tiny, im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">provised ring and jeered.

"It's all over the ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Look down there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down on the afterdeck, leaning comfort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably against the stacked lumber was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief Mate, the Chief engineer and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">two assistants, and perched on top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumber was Sparks, the young radio opera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor. The only officer not there was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain. By rights the Chief Mate</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldn t have been there either, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a little Irishman who dearly loved a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrap and he was not missing this one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even at the risk of a reprimand from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten minutes later Andresson climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the pop deck with the second mate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He nodded shortly at Barney and barked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Vince, "Take off those gloves." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">peeled off his shirt and gave it to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second mate. He wore only a pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick-soled sneakers and pants. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, heavy arms and a deep, muscle-padded</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney eyed him as Andresson held</seg><seg type="columnLine">out his hands to the second mate, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">laced on the gloves-. Andresson had twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him and maybe an inch or two in</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach, but he looked slow--though speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't going to mean so much in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">little, pint-sized ring. Not much chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">for foot work there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bosun, a chubby, stolid Dutchman</seg><seg type="columnLine">was timekeeper. There wasn't room for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">referee in the ring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vince had been shrewdly sizing up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third mate and just before the bosun</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the steel bar, that was to serve</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a bell, he whispered gleefully to Barney;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You got nothing to worry about, kid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's muscle-bound.

Our whole bankroll's riding on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney's mouth tightened. So that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">how the news got all over the ship--Vince.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The second mate must have shot off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth some more after Barney left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge--but Vince had spread the word.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unless the Captain was deaf, dumb and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind, he must have heard it, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bosun struck the steel bar with a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">chipping hammer and cried, "Go!" Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney moved easily from his corner. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take only two steps to meet Andresson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumbering rush. He parried a swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">right and stabbed a light left into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate's earnest face. Andresson missed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a short clubbing left, hammered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">right home to Barney's ribs and used his</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight to bull him across the ring to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ropes. Barney stayed inside and close</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pumped rights and lefts into that</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy midriff. The mate cuffed him across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of the head, but Barney had his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face against his chest, and Andresson did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know how to pry him loose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney brought up another short right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the mate grunted. Barney pushed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">away and danced out into the middle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ring, keeping his flickering left in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim, Scandanavian face. Andresson</seg><seg type="columnLine">plodded after him. They traded long-range</seg><seg type="columnLine">swings. There was a snap and speed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney's that the mate would never get,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was beating Andresson to every</seg><seg type="columnLine">punch--and still the mate kept plodding</seg><seg type="columnLine">in and plodding in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney felt a stab of pity as he lanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">out that straight left again and rocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bulky mate just enough to keep him</seg><seg type="columnLine">off-balance. This wasn't just a boxing</seg><seg type="columnLine">bout to Andresson. It was something much</seg><seg type="columnLine">more important. It was another skirmish</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the everlasting struggle between right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wrong. Andresson, in his bleak, craggy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scandanavian soul, firmly believed that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">personified Right and that the flame-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired. cold-eyed Barney was the epitome</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Wrong. Right must triumph.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT was the way Andresson thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was what kept him plodding</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight into that light barrage of long</seg><seg type="columnLine">rights and lefts. All he wanted to do was</seg><seg type="columnLine">get close enough to send in a smashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">right that would end the battle--but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't get set. He just couldn't seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get his feet in position so he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the full weight of righteous wrath</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind his heavy right arm. He blamed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">on lack of training; he blamed it on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">failing light; he blamed it on the uneven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the iron-plated deck--he blamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it on everything but the flickering skill in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney's gloves. He took a right to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">16	FIGHT STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">jaw and a left jab on his nose but kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">going forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If Barney had put any real sting in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that left, his nose would have been smeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">from cheekbone to cheekbone, but Andre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sson did not know this. He felt only con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt for the lightness of the blow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept his wide right cocked. But when his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance came, it was so unexpected that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was caught flat-footed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney jabbed with his left, jabbed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jabbed again, and circled to the right, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he went around his foot slipped on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smear of crude oil. He floundered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed at Andresson for support. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate stood open-mouthed, then with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunt slammed in that waiting right. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught Barney high on the cheekbone. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg slid completely from under him and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down on the flat of his pants with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost visible thud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crew screamed with delight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the phlegmatic Dutch bosun became</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited and began to count almost as fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he could sputter the numbers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Vun, two, t'ree, faw, fife, zix zeben. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vince was on his feet snarling "Take</seg><seg type="columnLine">it easy, take it easy! Give him time!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crew booed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Up on the boat deck, the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">frowned. How did they expect him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignore the fight when they howled like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. But he gripped the rail and watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensely as Barney gathered his legs under</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and leaped to his feet as the bosun</seg><seg type="columnLine">sputtered, ". . . nine und. . ." The crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled back with a disappointed sigh as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney, his temper high, lashed into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulky mate and drove him back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ropes with all the sting he could put into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pumping gloves. Andresson pawed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, but furiously he swept the clumsy</seg><seg type="columnLine">defense aside and drove a right and left</seg><seg type="columnLine">to that square, heavy jaw. Andresson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs began to cave at the knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a start, the bosun realized he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed to be keeping time and he beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the steel bar with his hammer, yelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">gutterally, "Hey! Hey! Dots the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roundt. Hey! Stop idt!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Barney sat down on the crate Vince</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed under the ropes, Vince com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained, "What kind of round was that--</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten minutes long! Then just when you. . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney said, "Shut up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vince shut up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wait between rounds was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">five minutes long. When the bosun ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mered his steel bar, Andresson got up</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily and lumbered toward Barney, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands held a little higher, protecting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. He had been getting advice between</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounds. He looked cautious and slower</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ever. Barney stung him with three</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning left jabs and moved in close.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney's face was white and his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn down at the ends. He was leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">openings for the Swede--but nothing hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened. He didn't want to drop his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and have his head torn off. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">power in that awkward right of Andre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sson's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mate shot in a left that caught him</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ribs. It jarred him. A pale smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">flickered for an instant across his lips. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">jabbed for Andresson's face and the mate</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot in that left again. Barney gasped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped his guard. The mate swung that</seg><seg type="columnLine">looping right.' Barney rolled with the punch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking the weight off it, but he went to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees, hoping desperately he was making it</seg><seg type="columnLine">look like an honest knockdown. Andresson</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be satisfied with less.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The poop deck was a pandemonium.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every member of the crew was on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet and even the Chief Mate had jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the stack of lumber to see better, grab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing the pipe from between his clenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth before he bit through the stem.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andresson smiled sternly as Barney rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bosun yelled, . . nine und ten,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're oudt! You're oudt!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vince bent over Barney. "Okay, wise</seg><seg type="columnLine">guy, so you took a dive. So we're broke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nuts to you!" He jumped up and walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">away without seeing if Barney needed any</seg><seg type="columnLine">help, without lifting him to his feet, with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out even taking off his gloves. But Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen the hatred in his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up on the boat deck, the Captain's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands relaxed on the rail. He flicked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">perspiration from his upper lip. Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thank God that was over! It was all right</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. That third mate was all right. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a good boy. It would have been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shame to break him--but a mate who's</seg><seg type="columnLine">been licked by a deck hand isn't a mate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">OISE FIST WAS IRISH!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">17</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A mate has to enforce discipline. If Nolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">had beaten him, that story would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed Andresson around the whole mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chant marine, from one job to another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving from bad berths to worse. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain shook his shoulders and strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurriedly for his cabin before anyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught sight of him there. Praise be that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andresson had won. He liked Andresson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BARNEY and Vince landed in Newark</seg><seg type="columnLine">with only five dollars between them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Vince had bet even their pay on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight with the mate. Subtlely, Vince's</seg><seg type="columnLine">attitude toward Barney had changed. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was friendly, but faintly patronizing, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">one scoundrel might be toward a worse</seg><seg type="columnLine">scoundrel. He had figured it all out. Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney had thrown the fight. That was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing you couldn't fool Vince on. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew prize fighting, and he knew a tank</seg><seg type="columnLine">job when he saw one. He had seen Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">go down from a punch that shouldn't even</seg><seg type="columnLine">have shaken his hair. Barney had thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fight. That was obvious. And what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was equally obvious to Vince was that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate had slipped Barney a couple hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">or so to lay down. And Vince didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">blame Barney a bit. He would have done</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same. It was good business. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sore that Barney didn't share the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred or whatever it was. Well--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he kept his grin up there--that was okay.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was chicken feed. In fact, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">money in the bank. He had Barney's</seg><seg type="columnLine">number now, and that was going to pay</seg><seg type="columnLine">off. And in bigger numbers than a measly</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They took the bus from Port Newark</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Penn Station.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think we'd better wire Sammy Sloan</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have Lars Widlund send us some dough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tide us over till I find a job," Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "We can't go far on five bucks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," said Vince sarcastically, "that'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">be smart.

She was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">small but deep-breasted and her glance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sharpened with sensuous interest when the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">two tall brothers came from the dusty</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hallway and strode across the lobby to-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ward them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  1 he man looked sideways at her and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said wearily, "Ah, for gosh sake, Lily,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">meet them before you start making them."</seg><seg type="columnLine">ONE FIST</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She put on a full-lipped smile and said</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it "Shut up, you little rat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vince came forward with his hand out</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched and the man took it limply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is Alec Frazer, Barney," Vince</seg><seg type="columnLine">said heartily, "Alec's got a fight he wants</seg><seg type="columnLine">to talk over with you while we have dinner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where we going, Alec? You better take</seg><seg type="columnLine">it easy on yourself, because we're broke."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you said. Let's go down the Nov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">elty Grill for a slice of fish. That won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">bust me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman pinched his arm. "May I</seg><seg type="columnLine">come, too, darling?" she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Uh. Yeah. Sure. This is my wife,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helen. These are the Nolan boys, Vince</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Barney."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Barney is Ryan," smiled Vince. "That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ring name, Helen. Barney Ryan, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best light-heavy this side of the Rockies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the other side, too. I'll tell you all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it while these two talk business."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took Helen's arm and led her out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lobby, talking eagerly while Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Alec followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alec didn't say a word during the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">block walk to the Novelty Grill, but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard gray eyes darted from Helen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vince in front to Barney at his side. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">the initial, clinical glance, his eyes dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">carded Helen and Vince and watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney--watched the way he walked, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way he held his head, swung his arms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the intentness in his gaze, you might</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost have thought him a doctor. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a way, that was true. He was watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">for something, and what he saw satisfied</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. At the corner of Mulberry and Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ket, a cab blared a sudden horn, and Alec's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes stabbed at Barney, who merely waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the curb, then crossed when the taxi</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed. Alec's thin lips show a brief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They took a rear booth at the Novelty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Both Barney and Vince ate avidly.

Alec stabbed disinterestedly at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">swordfish, and Helen was watching Vince</seg><seg type="columnLine">too closely to enjoy anything that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">set before her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WAS IRISH!	19</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That patch over your eye, * she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly, "It gives you quite a look, Vince.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Piratical, strong, dashing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vince touched the patch with his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and looked quickly at Barney. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes me feel like a heel" he said shortly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, ain't you?" demanded Alec.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vince grinned. "Me? I'm just a farm</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy." Then, quickly switching, "What do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you think of the kid brother, Alec?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alec said, "No."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No?

He swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cynical eyes on Barney, "What's your</seg><seg type="columnLine">price for a dive?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Vince gripped the table edge and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">white. He said hastily, "Wait a minute."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nuts." Alec did not even look at him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's your price for a dive, Barney?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney looked from Alec to Vince,</seg><seg type="columnLine">back again. "A dive?" he stammered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah, a dive. A tank job. You got a</seg><seg type="columnLine">price, ain't you? Your brother here said</seg><seg type="columnLine">you did. Well, what is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney felt suddenly ashamed.

You stuck your</seg><seg type="columnLine">big foot in it, now get it out.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. Alec jerked his chin contemptuously at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vince and said to Barney, "This punk</seg><seg type="columnLine">your manager?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney shook his head.

You can believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">it or not. Maybe I am. Maybe not. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll tell you this much--Abe Salinski wants</seg><seg type="columnLine">a boy for a tank job, and your brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">here said you were it. I don't think so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Salinski wants a shot at the champ. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">building a rep. He'll pay five C's. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you say, Barney?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vince slapped the table. "I thought I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to handle that end of it," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">angrily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alec shrugged.

You don't have to sign a</seg><seg type="columnLine">contract with me. Just give me a chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney looked hard at him and Alec</seg><seg type="columnLine">met his eyes squarely. Barney nodded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Okay," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE WAS in Miehle's Gym at nine</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next morning. Alec had a pair</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ring shoes and trunks for him and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back to the locker room to change.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alec had looked at the worried frown</seg><seg type="columnLine">between his eyes, had started to say some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, had thought the better of it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">let it drop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Barney came back from the locker</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, Alec was talking to a stocky heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was pulling the weights at the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the big room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here he comes now," Alec said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">'There's an extra fin in it for you if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can put him down and keep him there."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The heavy looked at Barney with re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">newed interest. To him Barney was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">another tall, lean scrapper, flaring wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the upper chest into powerful shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders. Barney moved with a lazy, deceptive</seg><seg type="columnLine">stride. The heavy wasn't impressed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can pay mo now," he yawned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Them tall, skinny ones can't take it in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle. I'll cut him in half." He took</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the two pairs of practice gloves</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alec had under his arm and slid his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">into them with accustomed ease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney came up, looking around with</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity. "I never trained in a gym be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore," he said. "Smoky in here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The heavy looked at Alec in disgust.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alec said woodenly, "Barney, this is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clapper Wells. He's gonna go a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounds with you. Make it good. I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see what you can do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney said, "Sure," and grinned at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wells, who nodded disinterestedly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled under the ropes into the practice</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring. Barney followed him after Alec</seg><seg type="columnLine">laced up his gloves. Wells lounged out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cjrner where he had been leaning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bored, against the ropes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney sparred lightly, the way he al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways did with Vince, losening up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">those fast little left jabs, dancing around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slow-moving Wells to warm up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs. Without blinking, Clapper took four</seg><seg type="columnLine">lefts to the jaw and side of the face. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">languidly raised his guard a little higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gave Alec a dry, pitying glance. Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney peppered him with a shower of</seg><seg type="columnLine">featherweight rights and lefts, moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">around a little faster now. Wells waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he was sure he wasn't going to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">into anything solid, then stepped in, taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">a light left to the jaw, and hooked a</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage right to Barney's ribs. He brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his left and sank the right again. Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney gasped and went back against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ropes on his heels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">OISE FIST WAS IRISH!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">21</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wells lunged after him, grunting as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw in a hard left and a harder right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A mist swam before Barney's eyes and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched at Wells' arms, but the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed him away, took a short step back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward and drove a straight right flush to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney's jaw. He hit him twice more</seg><seg type="columnLine">with short hooks as he went down. Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">sagged to his hands and knees and swayed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head hanging. Wells gave him a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance, then turned on his heel and walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the ring to the corner where Alec</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frazer was biting at his nails.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll take it now, Alec," he yawned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What a creampuff! He ought to be up</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Sunday."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah? Take a look behind you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wells turned. His eyes widened in</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise. Barney was not only up, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dancing blue eyes said that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for a fight. Wells grinned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, well," he said, "if the little rubber</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball ain't bounced up again. I hate to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, but let's go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He put up his hands and let Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to him. He saw the left coming and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he moved his head a little, intending to</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll with it, then bore in with savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands for the midsection. It caught him</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the cheekbone. There was an explosion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sparks before his eyes. A right flushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his jaw from the other side and he grabbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately for a clinch. Something ripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his body and he clung tighter. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw his weight forward and, locked to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, they staggered across the ring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wells gasped, "Take it easy, bud.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's only a fin in this for me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A glove crashed against his chin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sat down. He stayed there until his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head cleared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alec kept saying impatiently, "Come on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">come on. I could have counted you out</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wells turned his head and thumbed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose. He'd get up when he was good and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready. His temper began to prickle. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lousy trick! Leading him on like that</seg><seg type="columnLine">so he'd run into that powerhouse wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He climbed slowly to his feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched, holding a tight guard. Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">came at him, weaving lithely. Wells didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw a punch. He carried and ducked,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting, just waiting for a chance to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">in close where he could do the most dam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney didn't like it in the middle. Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was just where he was going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get it. Barney's left flickered time and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again over his guard and they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">punches that stung, but it was the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Wells kept his eye on. He didn't like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left, but he could take it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney was grinning. He was warmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up now and his gloves flickered in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">out so effortlessly that there didn't look</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be any real snap in them. They seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lick out, lightly touch Wells' head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">snap back into position for the next blow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the heavy swung, Barney reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and touched this thick biceps, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched them it seemed, and the sting</seg><seg type="columnLine">evaporated from the punch. But Wells</seg><seg type="columnLine">could tell you what was behind those light</seg><seg type="columnLine">touches; so could Alec Frazer, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">could the tall thin man, wearing a rakish</seg><seg type="columnLine">derby, who stood behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney went in with his hands a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher, and was just what Wells had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for--a clearer shot at that mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">section. He lunged in, pumping with both</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and felt them land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But almost simultaneously his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocked from twin explosions that crashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his chin. Darkness fell with a thunder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous rush. When he opened his eyes, Alec</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frazer was mopping his face with a wet</seg><seg type="columnLine">towel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You might of told me," he said bitterly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Who is he, anyway, Billy Conn's</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just a mick from the West. I never</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw him fight in my life Clapper."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wells looked at Barney, who was pulling</seg><seg type="columnLine">off his big gloves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You got quite a wallop, kid."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney grinned. "Sorry I got sore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clapper.

It's tough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know just how you feel." He climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet and as he turned to slip under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ropes, Alec slipped him a ten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALEC threw a shapless robe over Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney's shoulders and whispered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's a guy over here I want you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">22</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIGHT STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">meet.

Talk sense.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tell you what I'll do--if he shows up to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow night the way he did this morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if the crowd likes him, I'll think</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him for a semi-final."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alec threw up his hands in despair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grumbled, but finally said grudgingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Who'll he be fighting?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A1 Moore, a Harrison boy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"That meatball] It won't go a round."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willis smiled from Alec to Barney, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned back. "I don't go for one-round</seg><seg type="columnLine">knockouts," he said, "I've seen too many</seg><seg type="columnLine">good boys put away trying it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Willis winked at Alec. "And he's smart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too," he said. "See you tomorrow night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">guys." He walked away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he was out of earshot, Alec said</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleefully, "Sold him, by heck! Believe it</seg><seg type="columnLine">or not, lie's one of the toughest onions</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the racket."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How tough is this A1 Moore?" Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alec grimaced. "He's got two hands</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and one of 'eni's a right, and so far he</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't seem to care who punches him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snoot. The kid who was supposed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have fought him didn't come down with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken hand. He came down with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken nerve. I happen to know. You'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">earn your fifty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney nodded. "Nobody looks good</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a palooka. I don't like push overs."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Talking of push overs," Alec pulled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">newspaper from his pocket, "Take a look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this and thank your lucky stars." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed at a paragraph in a sport column</seg><seg type="columnLine">called Inside stuff with Jimmy Duff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It said, "Mentioning no names, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's a light-heavy contender around</seg><seg type="columnLine">town looking for a push over and offering</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hundred, providing that he won't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to push too hard. This department is</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigating, and if a fish has nibbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">there'll be two of them telling the Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission how come."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He means that, too," Alec said seri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously. "Duff's a tough baby. Am I glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">we didn't nibble! Salinski won't dare</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight a set up now. Duff's the boy who</seg><seg type="columnLine">can put the fear of God in them. Well,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stuffed the paper back into his pocket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"put on your clothes and do a little road</seg><seg type="columnLine">work in the park. I don't think you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">need anything more in here today."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney hesitated. "Alec," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Look, if you're going to handle me, tank</seg><seg type="columnLine">jobs are out from now on. All tank jobs."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alec's eyes lighted. "Kid, all my life I</seg><seg type="columnLine">been looking for a fighter--a clean guy I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be ashamed of handling. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he never got to be champ. I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're it. Know what I mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Okay. That's the answer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's the answer. You won't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to worry about. Now," his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">took on a note of authority again, "now</seg><seg type="columnLine">get dressed and get out there and run a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little. You shouldn't of let Clapper move</seg><seg type="columnLine">in on you the way you did that first time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We're gonna get a little more spring in</seg><seg type="columnLine">those legs. Now get going."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as Barney turned away, he stam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mered, "Say . . uh . . . did . . did your</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother . . . get back to the hotel all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right last night?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney stopped. Vince had not been at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hotel when he awakened that morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ONE FIST WAS IRISH!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and his bed had not been slept in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But he said, "Yeah. Sure. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alec looked visibly relieved. "I just</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered. He ... he seemed kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sore," he mumbled. "Get dressed, get</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed. Waiting for me to dress you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney grinned and walked toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">locker room, but his grin disappeared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment his back was turned. Poor guy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought, poor guy. He knew what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was behind that question. Helen Frazer</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not been home last night, either.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHILE BARNEY was taking his</seg><seg type="columnLine">roadwork in Branch Brook Park,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alec dropped in to see Jimmy Duff, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sport writer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The kid's got everything, Jimmy," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "He can box and he can hit. Sure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are a thousand guys with the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff, but he's got something else. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">should of seen what he did to Clapper</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wells this morning after the Clapper</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked him down for a good count. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished the Clapper off like it was a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal grudge. He never let up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duff riffled through the papers on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk. He had a round, pink face and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little rosebud mouth, but his eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray and intent like those of a hungry</seg><seg type="columnLine">shark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hear he was approached to take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall for Salinski," he said bluntly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was one of the reasons Alec had</seg><seg type="columnLine">visited Duff. Ordinarily he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">stayed away until Barney'd had at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">one fight. "Sure he was approached," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said promptly, "but he turned it down."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He should have reported it to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Commission."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, Jimmy," Alec said reproachfully,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you know better than that. You know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how these things are done--there's nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to put the finger on. Suppose some hot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot you'd never seen before and you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">never see again comes up to a fighter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">says out of the side of his mouth--'there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spot for you on the St. Mike card next</seg><seg type="columnLine">month. I ain't saying a certain guy'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the same ring with you, but if you took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the count in the fifth and when you got</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">back to your dressing room and there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an envelope for you, wouldn't you be sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised to find five C's in it?' That's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">typical approach around here. What can</seg><seg type="columnLine">you do with it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duff tapped his teeth with the tip of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shears. "Who's this Barney Ryan</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting tomorrow night?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That tough Harrison egg, A1 Moore."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, grinning, "Maybe you think there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fix on that, too?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Could be," Duff said casually, "To</seg><seg type="columnLine">build Ryan up. I think I'll drop in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">look it over. I can tell when Moore's try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing or not." He put down the shears and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked Alec full in the face. "I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust you from here to there Alec. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be the first fix you've been errand</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy for. God help you and this Ryan</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I as much as smell fish. Personally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I like you, but I don't like your habits. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't like the way your hands shake when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see a. chance to make a buck. Go down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and have a beer and think it over. I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eye on you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The enthusiasm went dead in Alec. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't deny anything Duff had said. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could explain. He could tell Duff about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helen, that he loved her, that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">only stuck to him as long as he was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chips, and in the fight game you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">either lucky or crooked--but Duff would</seg><seg type="columnLine">only laugh at him. Duff was tougher than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steel in a bank safe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped at the door and faltered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I suppose you wouldn't tell me who</seg><seg type="columnLine">tipped you off that Ryan was approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a fix."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duff said derisively, "Don't be silly."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alec went slowly down the stairs to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street. He glanced mechanically at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his watch, then, with dragging steps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked up to Broad Street and took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't really expect Helen would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the apartment when he walked in, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smoldering ache burst into tongues of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain when he found the rooms actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty, the way he had left them that</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning. Then he saw the closet and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty bureau drawers hanging out. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes were gone, even her handkerchiefs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bathing suit. He stared dumbly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked for a note, but of course there</seg><seg type="columnLine">24	FIGHT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't any. Helen would never have</seg><seg type="columnLine">bothered to leave a note, would never</seg><seg type="columnLine">have bothered to ease the pain. His mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted and he strode for the kitchen. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched up the bottle on the table but</seg><seg type="columnLine">even while he was drinking, the tears were</seg><seg type="columnLine">spilling down his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VINCE did not come back to the hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night, either. In fact, he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn up until Barney was getting ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave for St. Mike's Arena. Barney's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped wide when he walked in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a different Vince. He was wearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a yellow sport jacket, a coffee brown shirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brown sharkskin slacks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look me over," he said with a grin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where'd you get the money for that?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Take it easy. I didn't hold up any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. I cleaned up in a crap game," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lied. He didn't intend telling Barney that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had sent to Widlund for five hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars from the sale of their raspberries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney shook his head. "Aw, Vince,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're not going to start that again, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you? You know what it was like out in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tacoma. You were in hock half the time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why don't you. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was just for the stake, Barney,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vince interrupted swiftly, "I'm off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dice from now on. I got a job. This guy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willis over at the St. Mike's Arena needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a publicity man and I talked myself into</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Not bad, eh?''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On the level?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On the level, kid. You know me, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can talk myself into anything. Say, Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney . . he affected embarrassment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"there's . . no hard feelings about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other night, is there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney looked down at his hands. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a crummy thing to try, Vince. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">know I wouldn't throw a fight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure. I don't know what got into me,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vince said glibly, "I guess maybe it looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an easy way to make five hundred,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and no one'd blame you for getting beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Salinski. But just like you say, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a crummy thing to try. I'm strictly</seg><seg type="columnLine">legit from now on. Honest, Barney."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Okay, Vince. I'm glad to hear it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vince threw his arm around Barney's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder as they walked toward the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Gonna beat this punk tonight, Kid? He's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">three-to-one and I got a hundred riding on</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why don't you lay off the easy money,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vince? How do I know if I'm going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat him?'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vince laughed. "This isn't gambling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">kid. I've seen you fight when you get</seg><seg type="columnLine">sore. You'll take him apart. Well," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">slapped Barney on the arm, "see you at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Arena."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney was faintly surprised when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vince turned and walked down the street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving him standing there. He saw Vince</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn the corner, and a moment later he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the grind of a car starting off in</seg><seg type="columnLine">low gear, and then he understood. Helen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frazer had been waiting there for him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vince was heading for trouble again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alec was not at the Arena when he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. He went to the general dressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and slowly changed into the trunks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shoes Alec had gotten for him. Fran</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willis came in, leaned against the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney said, "Hello, Mr. Willis. Seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alec?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Willis shook his head. "Heard he's hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing trouble. I'll give you a boy for your</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner, but you'll have to slip him a five.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Going to give us a good fight tonight?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney grinned. Then, "Thanks for</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving my brother that job, Mr. Willis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vince is smart. You won't be sorry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Willis said drily, "I hope. See you later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ryan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney stood in the runway, the shape-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less old robe thrown over his shoulders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and watched two young inexperienced</seg><seg type="columnLine">middleweights trying to tear each other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads off. They were both bloody and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd was screaming. The bell rang and</seg><seg type="columnLine">both staggered to their corners. The ref-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eree raised the arm of one and the crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed but cheered good-naturedly. Who</seg><seg type="columnLine">cares who wins a brawl like that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The crowd was silent when Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped lightly into the ring, but it burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a roar when A1 Moore strutted down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aisle, cocky and tough. He was shorter</seg><seg type="columnLine">than Barney, but heavier through the body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The referee, an ex-heavy, gave them</seg><seg type="columnLine">the instructions in a hoarse rumble. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a tough referee and you had to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">punching when he was in the ring. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">ONE FIST WAS IRISH!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">25</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't seem to believe such a thing as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">foul existed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moore tried to act just as tough. lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a reputation for being a scrapper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in and out of the ring, and he was trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to live up to it. He grabbed Barney by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arms and snarled at the referee,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This guy's got a habit of doin' this,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he jabbed his thumb at Barneys eye, "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">put his own brothers eye out. If he tries</seg><seg type="columnLine">that on me, I'll give him everything from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boots up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The referee growled, "Get back to your</seg><seg type="columnLine">corners and quit the clowning." He gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">each of them a shove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barneys face was white. His lips were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thin line and his eyes were blue flames</seg><seg type="columnLine">as that old fury welled up inside him. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways to be reminded of what he had done</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Vince!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moore bounded across the ring at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell, coming in low and hard, mauling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">both hands. He grabbed Barney and</seg><seg type="columnLine">butted and wrestled him back to the ropes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">working with everything he had. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">fouled Barney twice before the referee</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted them. He always did that, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually worked. He put the fear of God</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his opponents. He even tried to reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney over the referee's arms as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were parted, knowing he could get away</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it, knowing the crowd was eating it</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. It was all part of the reputation he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was building. He came sweeping in again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Barney nailed him on the bridge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nose with that straight left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moore's head flew back and he flailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">backward across the ring. Barney stalked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Moore crouched. Blood dripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his face. He held up his hands but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he seemed unable to move his legs. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror in his eyes was so wild that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden hush washed back from ringside</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the deeps of the auditorium. Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">went in swiftly and Moore, suddenly find-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his legs, went skittering down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ropes, fleeing.

Barney straightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">him up with a lifting right and drove him</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the corner. He stood wide-legged and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat-footed and lashed a savage, two-</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed attack, swaying from leg to leg.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moore's head bobbed and his hair danced</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the gloves beat soddenly at his face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he couldn't fall for Barney had him</seg><seg type="columnLine">wedged in the corner and the blazing fury</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept Barney's hands beating in a frenzy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of punishment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A towel went flying through the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Moore's corners and at ringside even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reporters were on their feet, screaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a shrieking woman in the second row</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beating at them with her handbag.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The burly referee hurled himself at Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney, wound his heavy anns around him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as he dragged him back, Moore fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight forward on his face.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harrison boy was coming around.

Pfaff</seg><seg type="columnLine">took another to the side of the head, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly lunged inside, working both short</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful arms.

But before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">referee could come to part them* he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed Pfaff away with a surge of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders and sent in a straight left that</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed between PfafFs nose and cheek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone. Pfaff's head went back as if on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hinge and Barney hit him again while his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chin was still tilted.

You</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on the short end of 10-1."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BARNEY was off the table in a swoop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing stride.

Vinee swore and swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him. Barney saw the fist coming. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked his head to one side and Vince's</seg><seg type="columnLine">knuckles split the skin on his cheekbone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The compressed fury exploded in his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he lunged at Vince with both hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vince cried out in terror. Barney's fist</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught him on the left cheekbone and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelving cartilage over his eye. He crashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the chair beside the door and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the floor. He rolled on his back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The black patch had come off and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sightless socket stared emptily and redly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A small trickle of blood curtained his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left eye and ran down his cheek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney crouched, rigid with horror. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood moved down Vince's cheek like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching, accusing finger. He felt sick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Vince!" he cried in anguish, "Vince!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He picked Vince up and gently laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on the rubbing table. Frantically he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed into the shower for a wet towel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he came out, Vince was sitting up</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the table, .his hand to the cut over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his left eye. His fingers came away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">greasy with blood, and for a moment his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was half mad with fear--the fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of total blindness. But in the next instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">30	FIGHT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his face changed. He was seeing--he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing the blood on his fingers, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing Barney standing there, ashen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeked. He hadn't been blinded--but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't relief that showed in his face; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rage, hatred, cruelty. With a hoarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">growl, he leaped from the table and flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself at Barney.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew! that Barney wouldn't defend</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, wouldn't strike back. He set</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself and threw a hard, roundhouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">right that crashed on the side of Barney's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. Deliberately he swung his left and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut open the opposite side. Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">groaned, bowed behind his hands and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">back a step. Vince followed him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooked his fist heavily into Barney's</seg><seg type="columnLine">unprotected stomach, then rocked him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a right and left to the sides of the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">again as Barney's hands dropped. Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney was just standing there, leaning weakly</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall. Another groan was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrenched from him as Vince's cutting</seg><seg type="columnLine">fists smashed into his face, first the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye, then the left. Vince's knuckles ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mered his lips against his teeth and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole mouth went numb. He was hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">several times after that, but he was falling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was out when he hit the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vince stood panting for a moment, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightened up and shrugged his sport</seg><seg type="columnLine">jacket back in place.

On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second day Alec came to him. Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lying in bed, fully dressed, his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the wall. He did not stir, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he heard the door close, even when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alec sat on the edge of the bed. Alec lit</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cigarette.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is a heluva way to train for Salin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ski," he said mildly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney did not answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alec said, "Sick, kid?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still there was no answer. Alec took</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few more puffs from the cigarette. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself was gaunt and there were shadows</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of corroding tragedy under his eyes. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand trembled each time he lifted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigarette to his mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he spoke again it was with effort.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I heard that scrap between you and your</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother the other night," he said jerkily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I was out in the corridor. Vince wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one who put A1 Moore up to taunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">you about putting his eye out, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't the one who tipped off Heinie</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pfaff," he took a breath, "I was the guy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney. I tipped them off. Vince told me</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it that night I braced you to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fall for Salinski. Vince said he had you</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the palm of his hand. That's what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he told me before we met you. He said</seg><seg type="columnLine">all he had to do to drive you crazy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to mention his eye, or just bring up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name of that Canuck Dupre. I had Moore</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Pfaff tipped off because I hoped you'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">rip them apart when they opened their</seg><seg type="columnLine">yaps. They thought you'd fall apart. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted you to be sure to win, Barney.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's why I did it. Don't blame," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke with difficulty again, "don't blame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vince for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though Alec did not realize it, this con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fession only ground salt into Barney's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounds, made things worse. Now Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that he had attacked Vince with</seg><seg type="columnLine">no provocation, had come close to blinding</seg><seg type="columnLine">him entirely. And for what. For some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing Alec had done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said in a dead, muffled voice, "Get</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aw, come on, Barney. This ain't no</seg><seg type="columnLine">way.

"Okay," he said angrily, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're pulling all of us down with you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You know what Duff's gonna say when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hears the fight's off.

If I have the dough, she'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">come back. I'm not gonna let your lousy</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother take her away from me. I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">her back! And you're not gonna stop me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You hear? You're not gonna stop me!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He fairly glittered with the brittle rage</seg><seg type="columnLine">that wasn't entirely sane. He swore as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrenched open the door. He slammed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Barney could hear the trickle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaster dust behind the loose wallpaper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He closed his eyes and turned his battered</seg><seg type="columnLine">face into the pillow. A sense of guilt</seg><seg type="columnLine">and doom flooded over him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alec was back on Thursday, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him was Vince, jaunty in a green sport</seg><seg type="columnLine">jacket. There was a small bruise on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left cheekbone, but his eye sparkled more</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly than ever. Barney sat hunched</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the tattered club chair beside the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alec said coldly, "This . . .

It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">obvious that even being in the same room</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Vince was agony to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vince sat on the edge of the bed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chided, "Aw, snap out of it, Barney.

"I'm the guy that</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be taking it hard, not you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Barney looked up. He stammered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Vince</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah. I been kind of a louse, ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">I?

He put his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his face, but watched Barney between</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney jumped up.

You</seg><seg type="columnLine">get shaved and dressed," he patted Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">on'the back, "I'm gonna show you a real</seg><seg type="columnLine">time.

He skipped rope to sharpen his</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But mostly Alec worked to fashion his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left into a killing weapon.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked to Barney's right and slapped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">two left jabs of his own. Barney's head</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked twice and he covered automatically,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunching his shoulders a little higher. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat-footedly retreated before Salinski's ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vance. Salinski kept always to his right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">peppering away with that left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stabbed with his left, but Salinski</seg><seg type="columnLine">bobbed sideways and hammered him on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ribs with a left. Barney winced. Salin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ski could hit, he could hit harder than any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one he'd ever met. He covered and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated slowly. All of a sudden, Salinski</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducked his head, went in under Barney's</seg><seg type="columnLine">right and dug into his body with both</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. Barney automatically tied him up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're going great," Alec whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he sponged him off. "Just take it easy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He'll have to come to your left when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wants to get in with that right of his,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then let him have it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Salinski seemed to have forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had a right. He kept going in under</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney's right and slamming him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">those jolting lefts. He rolled away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">every left Barney threw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He moved a little faster in Round Two.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The crowd was yelling for blood, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to give it to them. He picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney's left off in mid-air and slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in with a right that caught Barney flush on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nose. A razor of pain sliced into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney's brain and the blood was a shawl</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his mouth an chin. Salinski grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he ducked under Barney's left and</seg><seg type="columnLine">raged at his stomach with ripping hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney doubled under the tornado of pain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Salinski stepped back and calmly cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face to pieces with slicing hooks. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the kind of work Salinski liked. Chop</seg><seg type="columnLine">them up, then cut them down--but chop</seg><seg type="columnLine">them up first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney reeled to his corner and lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasping on his stool while Alec stopped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flow of blood over his eyes with astringent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alec was hissing advice, but Barney did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hear him. His body was a torment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pain and his broken nose throbbed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabbing deep into his head with each</seg><seg type="columnLine">throb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking down into the press row, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Duff's plump, jeering face, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that he wasn't putting up a battle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He'd have to do better to save Vince.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Salinski came out confidently in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third. He had nothing to worry about</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. He had solved Barney's left, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't afraid of the right. He came in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">weaving and bobbing, swinging hard for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body. Barney shuffled his left foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward and nailed him on the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face with a straight right, the right Salinski</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought no longer counted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went back on his heels and his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew up. Barney stepped in, sank a left to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the solar plexus and swung a right over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dropping guard. Salinski's eyes went</seg><seg type="columnLine">glassy and he dropped to his knees. Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney stared at him with horror, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">referee had to thrust him forcibly to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">neutral corner. Barney's heart thudded</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickeningly as the referee's inexorable arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose and fell. Salinski was on one knee</seg><seg type="columnLine">at "seven" and up at "nine." The referee</seg><seg type="columnLine">siezed his arms, wiped off his gloves</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his shirt and stepped back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Salinski crouched as Barney walked to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward him. There was caution in Salinski's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and, though Barney boxed weakly, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept the fight at arm's length for the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mainder of the round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alec wasn't in the corner when Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back to his stool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second sponged him briskly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "He seen his wife up there and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back to have a word with her. He'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be right back. He says to keep after Abe</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that left. You'll get broke in half,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he says, if Abe finds out you got a right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, jeez, it seems to me . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney said wearily, resting his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the ropes, "Okay okay. Give me</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little water."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went out in the Fourth determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take no chances of repetition of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost-disastrous knockdown, but Salinski</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not the kind of fighter you could</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely block. You had to punch with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was too fast for purely defensive</seg><seg type="columnLine">tactics, too smart. The moment he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney holding back, he rocked him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a volley of rights and lefts. Blood-smeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips puffed, one eye half closed from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vicious left hook, Barney went down be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ONE FIST WAS IRISH!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">35</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fore one minute of the round had passed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took "eight", but Salinski was raging</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him the moment he was up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crowd was on its feet baying as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he drove Barney back into the ropes with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ferocious body attack and pinned him</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, rattling his jaw with one-two's,</seg><seg type="columnLine">working down to the stomach again. Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney clutched, holding himself together by</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer nerve, keeping himself on his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">only because he knew he had to make it</seg><seg type="columnLine">look good. Weakly, he fought back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through the haze of pain, he saw Salin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ski's face before him and he hooked a</seg><seg type="columnLine">right into it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The face bobbed and he stabbed at it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a left. Salinski crowded closer, bury-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his head against Barney's chest. Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney was numbly surprised. Salinski</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldn't have done that. He was throw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing away his advantage, because now Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">new was able to tie him up and they stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked until the referee parted them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not know the bell had rung</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the referee grabbed him roughly by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shoulder and growled, "Break it up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">break it up. Get back to your corner."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stumbled across the ring. Alec stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the apron waiting for him. Barney's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was bad, but Alec's was ghastly. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow skin was so tight against his skull</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his bones stood out in sharp prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inence, and his eyes burned deep in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">sockets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alec's fluttering hands shoved him down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the stool and Alec sobbed, "This</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaughter's gotta stop."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney mumbled, "Don't let them stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, Alec.

His beady eyes watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two red blobs that were Barney's fists.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So there was still thunder in them. Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could wait. He'd cut him up a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, take some of the sap of him, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">chop him down. The fight was young. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved to Barney's right on those spindly</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs of his. Barney turned slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something was building up inside him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something exploded, blowing all the dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the corners the long years had made.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now he knew why he'd had to go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sammy Sloan every so often for a fight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vince. He remembered the storming fury</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rode his gloves, and now he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">why it was. He had always seen Vince</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in the ring with him, Vince's jeering</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. That Canuck, Dupre, had looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Vince.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had known, right from the beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Vince was something evil that had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">-be destroyed, but he had never faced it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had tried to take the blame himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell himself that he was the evil. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vince had always dirtied everything he</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched. He felt suddenly clean and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">freshed. He didn't have to worry about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vince anymore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the first time, he seemed to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Salinski there in the ring with him--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall man with thin legs and a chest that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too heavy for him, a man with cruelty</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his little eyes, a man with a knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">twist on his slitted mouth. Barney went</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him, up on his toes, weaving. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">jabbed with his left and Salinski bobbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he knew he would--bobbed straight into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a driving right. Salinski staggered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed for a clinch, but Barney nailed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a short right and drove him back</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Salinski stood straddle-legged and tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to slug it out, thinking this a short-lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">flurry. But Barney was waiting for him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He slipped a right and his left went up in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a short arc. Salinski's legs went watery</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he half stumbled and was half ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mered back to the ropes. His eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfocussed but he fought automatically.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney got him into the corner and stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing flat-footed wove from side to side as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he drove in a savage right and left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Salinski was out on his feet. His guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as loose as a torn pocket. Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have hit him with anything. But that</seg><seg type="columnLine">festering fury no longer drove him. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of tearing into him as he had into</seg><seg type="columnLine">A1 Moore, as he had into Heinie Pfaff,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stepped back and mercifully let Salinski</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall to the floor. He helped them drag</seg><seg type="columnLine">Salinski to his stool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he walked to his own corner, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a shout and three loud claps as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone had slapped two boards together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A woman screamed, and there was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunder of frantic feet as the crowd at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left side of the ring rushed for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A blue-coated policeman ran across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring, tugging at his hip, and leaped over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ropes. Barney's second was standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his stool, staring over the bobbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads. His hand trembled at his slack</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth. He looked down at Barney.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your brother!" he gibbered, "Alec just</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot him, then shot himself. They're lay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on the floor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Barney turned. The crowd bubbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the spot where Vince had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting and three policemen were fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">their way through it. Barney turned away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stooped and picked up his robe. He tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to feel sorry for Vince, but all the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded into his mind Helen Frazer, dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her husband's bullet, Alec, Jeanne</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henrouille, Leon Henrouille. How many</seg><seg type="columnLine">others had there been?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jeanne Henrouille sat frozen in the seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">at ringside where kindly hands had placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her after her faint. Around her was</seg><seg type="columnLine">turmoil as men leaped 011 their chairs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">craning their necks to see better, but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">just sat staring straight ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney jumped down from the apron.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come on, Jeanne," he said, "There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing for us here." He led her up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aisle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">LEATHER</seg><seg type="columnLine">LARCENY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By Larry Sternig</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">This kid they practically dragged into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ring . . . made him fight . . . made</seg><seg type="columnLine">him yellow . . . made him tough . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him champ.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE was no one watching now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The jeweler was busy at the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the counter, and the few cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomers in the store were engaged in busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of their own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My hand went toward the watch, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then stopped.

A girl stood there, a plain girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but one who created the illusion of beauty</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of superb health. A girl with clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and a complexion there are no words</seg><seg type="columnLine">for, and a smile that went straight to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is," I agreed. I was staring at her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and realizing it, I blushed and looked awk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wardly at my hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think you'll like it here," she said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling. "Dad and I will try to see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you do." She held out a hand. "I'm Tim's</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter, Ellen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh," I said, and there was a tinge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitterness in my voice. I barely touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went inside, and up to the room Tim</seg><seg type="columnLine">had assigned me. I sat there on the bed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my mind passed Over the day's events.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt annoyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tim put me on a routine the next day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A routine of road work and bag punching,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swimming. Tim intended to build up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body that prison life had softened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went through it obediently. I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it like a bad child who was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">disciplined, and though I knew the situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was ridiculous, I also knew there</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't a thing I could do about it. Because</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tim Dolan had connections, and Tim's</seg><seg type="columnLine">word could put me back to that place that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave me nightmares.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw little of Ellen, and I was thankful</seg><seg type="columnLine">for that. The few times I'd seen her, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing strange and new had happened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my heart, and I'd felt a sharp regret over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first day's rudeness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All that was needed to make this set-up</seg><seg type="columnLine">tougher was for me to fall in love with her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a couple of other boys from Tim's</seg><seg type="columnLine">stable came up to train, and I had a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to mix it with them. One of the boys, Vic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grant, was a welter, and a good one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I mixed with Vic for two short rounds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and took the pasting of my life. Tim saw it</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, and a wrinkle deepened between his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, and he called a halt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He told me, "This Vic is good, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">that good. Haven't lost your heart, have</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, boy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My timing is off," I said, "and my wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't all back.

I was never a champ, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You never had the title," Tim corrected</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. He paused. "Don't think all the wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">things about me, Jimmy. There's a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">you may be wrong."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can tell me what to do," I said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But I can think what I please." I turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">on that, and went to the showers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vic Grant was unlacing his shoes when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I came in. He was a short man, even for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">yvelter, with a slugger's build. He said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, "Tim figuring on building you up, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">just till lie can peddle you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wouldn't know," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vic shook his square head. "Well, it's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">screwy set-up. Here I figured I'm really</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to get some promotion, and he picks</seg><seg type="columnLine">a has-been from the clink."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked him over slowly, while the bit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terness in me boiled. I looked him over</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly--and said nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I came out again, after my shower,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vic was talking to Tim, and by the tone of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice, he wasn't pleased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went up to my room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tim came in a few minutes later. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "I fixed you up for a prelitn spot for</seg><seg type="columnLine">next week. It's not much, but it's the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could do. You aren't ready for any big</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns yet, anyway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I asked, "What did Vic have to say?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A muscle ridged in Tim's jaw.

"I mean what did he</seg><seg type="columnLine">say about me ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tim looked at me for a moment. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He said you were yellow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I smiled. "Maybe I am."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't think so," Tim said, and left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thought back to the night of my crime.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the first time since the trial, I'd be</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing a crowd of people. People who knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">my story. It had been news, big news a</seg><seg type="columnLine">year ago, and they wouldn't have forgotten.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew enough about fight crowds to fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I didn't mix with Vic in the days that</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed. Tim imported a couple of boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I began to get the range again. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a long way from my best.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ellen drove me in the afternoon of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight. She'd been civil since that first day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but only civil. Today, she seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">going out of her way to be friendly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said, "Dad told me--about--about</seg><seg type="columnLine">your trouble. And he told me--" She</seg><seg type="columnLine">faltered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About blackmailing me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She kept her eyes on the road ahead. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's the way you put it." She paused.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That night, that night it happened. Did</seg><seg type="columnLine">you need the money?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My laugh was short. "I didn't even know</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was money in the purse."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She nodded, as though suddenly under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing. "It was at a party, wasn't it? You</seg><seg type="columnLine">were excited, nervous?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was at a party," I repeated, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though talking from some grim dream.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"One of those fancy parties, where the elite</seg><seg type="columnLine">invite a fighter for the atmosphere or some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. I walked into a room, and there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">some women's coats on the bed. And some</seg><seg type="columnLine">purses. I don't know what happened after</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. I simply couldn't help what I did. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the purse I took happened to have a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">more money in it than any purse should."</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was looking down at my hands, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shame in me brought a flush to my face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ellen's voice was soft. "You mustn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of yourself as a criminal. You've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to forget that. You--you were sick.

You admit that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She didn't say anything for a minute,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when she did talk, she evaded my ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. She said, "Dad isn't very often wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">about people. I hope he wasn't wrong about</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN the dressing room that night, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenseness that had grown in me the past</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks reached its peak. I could feel it</seg><seg type="columnLine">physically, in the tightening of my muscles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hammering of my heart. Tim was</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me every second, and Tim's eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">off of me for very few of those seconds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The call came, finally, and I went out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Tim and a handler. Out, and up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aisle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could feel Tim's presence, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense that he was walking very closely be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side me. The handler flanked my other side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the boys was coming down, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winner, and getting a hand. Then the crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">spotted me, and I held my breath, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayed. There was a silence, a sort of sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dued murmur. Then someone yelled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Lookit! The man of steal!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A laugh went up, a short laugh that dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved in a bedlam of talk. I kept my eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the glare ahead, and the bitterness</seg><seg type="columnLine">surged in my taut body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We went up, and through the ropes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a part of the tautness melted. For this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old glare, the old smell, the old noise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked over in the opposite corner, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">my opponent of the evening. A hairy, bulky</seg><seg type="columnLine">lad named Stover. A lad who looked like</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd been to the wars once too often.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ref was introducing us, and I dread-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed the reception I expected. But the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of the crowd's sentiment was the weak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of applause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I'd had a crazy notion during the past</seg><seg type="columnLine">few days of throwing this fight, just as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of getting back at Tim Dolan. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew now that I couldn't do it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maybe I wouldn't have to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stover came out with a rush at the bell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouching, and trying his best to look mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derous. I put a jab in his face, and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">my ground. Stover stopped, and began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I circled with him, kept pushing that left</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand in his face, vexing him into a lead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stover came in under the left, and put a</seg><seg type="columnLine">40	FIGHT STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy hook into my middle. I tied him up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We broke, and I was short with a left. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed a right, and Stover closed again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This time Stover's hook really shook me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I back-pedaled, jabbing. My chin was</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But Stover came in again, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought a right to my throat that gagged</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The lights began to waver as I hung on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Stover was pummelling my midriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">viciously, slamming away with both hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the lights went out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I heard a great buzzing in my ears, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pinwheel overhead seemed to be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scending on me. Somebody was calling out</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers. I heard "6."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I rose groggily to one knee at 8. At 9</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stover rushed in for the finisher, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">put the remnants of my strength into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistling right. It landed with a splat on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stover's nose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tim said, "this guy is strictly a mixer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keep him clear. He shouldn't be able to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">within shouting distance of you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stover came out for the second with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very red nose, and a little more caution. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved around in a shell, and I took the of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fensive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was short with a straight left, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw a right that wasn't short. I connccted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Stover's eyes with another straight left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then my right whistled to the button.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stover went back into the ropes, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed him in. But Stover tied me up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ref parted us, and we moved to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the ring, Stover circling, my left</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping him clear. Again Stover rushed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this time I was ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I put my weight into a straight left, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then crossed a hard right. Stover went back</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and crashed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I walked to a neutral corner, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunder of the crowd was sweet music to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My timing was back this round, and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">if Stover should get up, I knew I could take</seg><seg type="columnLine">him now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stover did get up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I moved in, and feinted him into a lead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was set, and really put my weight into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">right smash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HIS time Stover didn't get up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was a club fighter, this Stover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he'd been licked a lot of times. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">victory is always sweet. I almost felt normal</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in the dressing room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tim said, "You looked like your old self</seg><seg type="columnLine">for about a minute there. When you are,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll get you some good boys."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded, my eyes averted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day's papers gave the bout</seg><seg type="columnLine">more ink than it was worth. It had what</seg><seg type="columnLine">newspapermen call "human interest" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole account of my crime and subse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quent imprisonment went with it. I winced</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I read it, and the hate I had for Tim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolan was fired anew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later that morning, when I came in from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a two mile jog, Tim introduced me to a tall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">expensively dressed man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dr. Barton is a psychiatrist," Tim ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained, "and he wants to ask you some</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I didn't like the sound of that, but I sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted grudgingly. For almost an hour I</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered questions as honestly as I could.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later I heard Dr. Barton talking to Tim.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard the phrase, "compulsion neurosis"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and "unstable emotional condition " I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a human guinea pig.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Despite my poor mental condition, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, my physical health was coming back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its former peak. My timing was still bad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but my speed and wind were nearly what</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were. I mixed with a better than aver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age lightweight that afternoon and scored</seg><seg type="columnLine">often on that fleet target.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ellen was watching me from the ringside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she smiled as we finished the round in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flurry of leather. "You looked like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">champ for that last round," she told me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I managed a grin. "I feel like an insect</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a slide. Who was that doctor that gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">me the third degree this morning?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's one of the best psychiatrists in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country," Ellen said. "And he agreed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tim about you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what was their verdict ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was silent for a moment. Then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said with a smile, "they think you're one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best welterweight prospects they've</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," I said. "I'm a little ooy, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can't take the truth. Whatever it is, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't be worse than a purse snatcher."</seg><seg type="columnLine">LEATHER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She made a face. "Whatever it is, you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">know when they're sure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly I blurted, "I was thinking--</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's a good movie in the village tonight</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and--nh--I--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd love it," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a good movie. And there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great big musical comedy moon hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sky as we drove home. We stood on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the porch for a minute before turning in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the moon combined with Ellen's fra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grance was a little too much for me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My lips came down to hers, and her lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I said shakily, "I--I've had a girl or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two. But not like--I mean, for me, this is it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew it since that first day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She nodded. "Me, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I didn't get much sleep that night. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thing that could happen to make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation unbearable had happened. I'd have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to talk it over with Tim in the morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But in the morning, Ellen told me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You'd better not say anything to dad about</seg><seg type="columnLine">us right now. He and Vic had a quarrel</seg><seg type="columnLine">this morning, and he gave Vic his contract</seg><seg type="columnLine">back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I figured that was coming," I said. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think Tim lost a gold mine. That Vic will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be champ soon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ellen nodded. "That's what started the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarrel. Vic's been promised a chance at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the title by another manager if he could buy</seg><seg type="columnLine">his contract back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll bet Tim got plenty for it," I said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ellen looked at me queerly. "Sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wonder why I love you. He didn't get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dime for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I smiled, but said nothing. Loyalty was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">virtue I particularly admired, and I loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ellen all the more for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TIM arranged another bout for me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next week. It was a wind-up this time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a small club, and my opponent was a trial</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse who'd crashed many a hopeful to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sent him to slumberland in the fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the next morning, I had my talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">.with Tim about Ellen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tim said, "Ellen's old enough to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">her own mind. But it'll be kind of tough on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, don't you think, married to a man who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LARCENY	41</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hates her dad?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had no answer for that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the next three weeks, I had three more</seg><seg type="columnLine">bouts, and won them all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the night I won my last bout, Vic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grant won the welterweight title.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I told Ellen. "Tim never had a real line</seg><seg type="columnLine">on that boy. But I knew. I mixed with a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, and I can tell a champ when I see</seg><seg type="columnLine">one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe dad was blind," Ellen said</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. "When it came to welterweights,</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe he could only see one boy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I grinned. "Maybe--and maybe not."</seg><seg type="columnLine">That afternoon, Tim Dolan asked me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Would you like a shot at the title? Would</seg><seg type="columnLine">you like a crack at your old friend?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're the boss," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They want you now--in a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks," Tim said. "In six months you'd be</seg><seg type="columnLine">too hot to handle. But by then we might not</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the chance." He paused. "Think you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can take him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't think I ever saw the day I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">take him," I said modestly. "But I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">try."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tim shook his head. "That isn't enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll turn them down." His eyes were on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. "It might be your last chance at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crown, Jimmy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I won't lose any sleep over that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The afternoon papers carried the story</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a manager who'd refused a title fight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was comparable to a man biting a dog,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and good for a column.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I realized then that I'd put Tim on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot. For it was he who'd refused the fight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I didn't feel too good about that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went to him. I said, "accept the fight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tim. I don't know whether I can lick him</seg><seg type="columnLine">or not, but I promise that I'll fight the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight of my life."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whether you can lick him or not, you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to think you can," Tim said. "But that'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be my job, to make you think that way."</seg><seg type="columnLine">As it turned out, however, it .wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tim's job. For that evening Ellen told me</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that made my blood boil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That night," she said, "when we went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the movie, I stayed downstairs after you</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to bed, to do some bookwork for dad.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Vic came in." Her eyes left my face,,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He--well, he got a little fresh, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">slapped him. Dad happened to walk in just</seg><seg type="columnLine">42</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIGHT STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">then." She paused. "That's why he gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vic his contract back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I reached over to hold her head in my two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. I kissed her gently. "That guy will</seg><seg type="columnLine">know he's been in a fight, honey. I promise</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next two weeks were a grind, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">toughest training grind of my career. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had a lot to regain in those two weeks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'd need all the moxie I ever had for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two days before the bout, I began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">taper off, to prevent going stale. I saw a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Tim during those two days, and Tim</seg><seg type="columnLine">said to me one afternoon, "I'd like to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">you thought enough of me to know I'm hon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est. I'd like to think you wouldn't need</seg><seg type="columnLine">an explanation from me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was silent, studying him. Finally, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "I do think you're honest, Tim. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess the whole town knows that." I shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head. "I've been, well--rattled. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">before that happened, that thing that sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">me up, I'd been unsettled, nervous."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tim nodded. "This urge, this desire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">steal. Had you had it before that night?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">My thoughts raced. "Only in my mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you get what I mean. I mean, I'd see</seg><seg type="columnLine">things in stores and the thought of taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">them would come to me, but I didn't think</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was serious. I mean, a fellow gets a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thoughts he doesn't follow through with.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was one of them. Until that night."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You should have explained that to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">judge," Tim said. He paused. "You know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what kleptomania is, Jimmy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded. "Uh-huh. And I think I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather be tagged a criminal than a nut."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It isn't insanity," Tim said. "Your un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled condition had something to do with</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Maybe, we all have a touch of it--some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing for nothing, that's a pretty common</seg><seg type="columnLine">fault. That's why I--blackmailed you. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to keep your mind occupied on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thing you knew best. And I wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get you up here, where it's quiet. I wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cure you if I could."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I realized then, that all this should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been clear to me from the first day. I said</seg><seg type="columnLine">humbly, "Thanks, Tim. I think you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">cured me. But, why? Why go to all this</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble for a guy you only knew slightly?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Because," Tim said, "I think you're the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best welterweight in the w'orld. And be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cause--I always want to see the best man</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the top in this game."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE three of us drove in together the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning of the fight, and I felt more</seg><seg type="columnLine">physically and mentally fit than I had at</seg><seg type="columnLine">any time within my memory. I'd need to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be for this one tonight. For I had a lot more</seg><seg type="columnLine">respect for Vic Grant than Tim did. Ellen</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been right about her dad. Tim Dolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">was blind in the welterweight field; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could only see one man, and that was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">man--Jimmy Powers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The manager had released the psy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chiatrist's opinion of my malady, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers had given it a play. I wasn't sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether to feel vindicated or further con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">demned. One thing was certain, I was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most publicized welter in the game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There seemed to be a hundred reporters</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the weighing in, and another hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for us at the hotel. I kept my mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly shut, and let Tim do all the talking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tim Dolan was a master at it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the dressing room that night, Tim</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooed them all out. He told me, "Keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear for two rounds at least. Even if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">start to boo. For two rounds, Vic is better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than you are. That much I'll admit. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, he's not in your league."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grinning, I shook my head. "If I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">only fight like you think I can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ellen was there, then, for a final word,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I told her, "If I win, tonight, it's be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of you. This brawl I now dedicate to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She kissed me lightly. "Knock him into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cheap seats, Jimmy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the call came, and we went out to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the lights. The house was a sell-out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jam packed, the biggest crowd I'd ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced. But there was no tenseness in me</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the normal tenseness expected for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a title bout.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went up the aisle, with Tim and two</seg><seg type="columnLine">handlers, and the crowd's reception was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearteiling. I had a glimpse of Ellen, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed between the ropes, and she held her</seg><seg type="columnLine">small clenched hands aloft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On my stool, as I relaxed, while Vic's</seg><seg type="columnLine">new manager came over to inspect my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, my eyes were on the man across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring. A good man, broad and husky, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">those muscle bunches in his back that</seg><seg type="columnLine">LEATHER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">labeled the hitter. A champion. Tim Dolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brought him up to this. Tim had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought us both this far, and Tim thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was the better man. I certainly hoped so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We went out for the introductions, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the instructions. We went back to our cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ners to flex. The bell, and we turned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vic came in like a tornado. He came in</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Dempsey used to in his prime, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed two fists to my midriff that actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtled me back into the ropes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crowd gasped, and then rose with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hoarse cry. It was the fastest opening any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them had ever seen--or I, for that mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter. And I was on the receiving end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vic came in with his left hooking vi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciously, and took about three-quarters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my starch in the first ten seconds. I wilted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">got my hands inside, and hung on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ref broke us, and I got on my bi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cycle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For two minutes I kept clear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">charging Vic, kept my left pumping weakly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while my stomach settled, while the crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">howled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then I braced up, snapped home a</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight left, and was short with a right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vic tried to close, but I had the range with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my left now, and my timing was flawless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I managed to stay clear for the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">round, and scored twice with the right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In my corner, Tim said, "Whirlwind</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff. And he didn't do it. He shot his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolt."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We hope," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We hoped in vain. Vic stormed out for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second in a flurry of flying leather that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent me into a backward march. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Armstrong stuff. I rode it out, landing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinging jab enough to keep the champ cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tious, bringing home a short right that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped him in his tracks for a second.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I moved in lightly, circling a little, look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for a hole for my right. Vic turned with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, contempt in his eyes, and a smile on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I FEINTED twice and landed a left, tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">a right that missed. I moved around</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, using the left like a riveting machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Vic took it all with a grin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Angered, I moved in to mix--and Vic</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought up a killer from his knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LARCENY	43</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I fell forward and hung on, while my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head cleared. Vic went to work below. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke, stepped clear, and tried to paste him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a left. But Vic had smelled blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and no jab was going to slow him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He chased me for the remainder of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fans were booing at the bell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tim said, "I could have been wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">about that guy. But I wasn't wrong about</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. You've taken his best punch. You can</seg><seg type="columnLine">open up a little now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I almost laughed in his face at that one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said, "Did you bring some spinach ? What</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've got doesn't seem to be enough."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What you've got will be too much," Tim</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The third was slower. Vic seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think he could win this one when the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, but there was no hurry. He countered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and parried, circling always, moving in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">semi-crouch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did open up a little. My right was mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in now, short and swift, but Vic was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty much in a shell, and few of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed heavily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I began to set up things with the left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">feinting, looking for openings. But Vic</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't champ for nothing. Vic didn't bite.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vic taunted me, smiling, and Vic moved in</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the end of the round and brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hook with him. It was a good hook.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was weary at the bell. I'd taken a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">during those first two rounds, more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could have taken a month ago, and I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alized how far along Tim's conditioning</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brought me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fourth was faster. Vic began to mix</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. But I had his rhythm now, and I beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to the punch. Vic stepped up the pace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I stepped with him. For twenty seconds</seg><seg type="columnLine">we traded. Then I broke, stepped back--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vic rushed and I met him with a straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">right that landed squarely on the button.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vic went back a half step and toppled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vic was up at 9. I didn't rush. I came in</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously, and brought the left in sharply</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice, before trying another right. Vic was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still alert. The right was shorthand Vic</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to close.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tied him up at the bell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tim said, "That's the Jimmy Powers we</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to know. That's the Powers who's</seg><seg type="columnLine">44	FIGHT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">going to be champ. Like Loughran. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tunney. Like silk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fifth was slow. Vic wouldn't lead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I couldn't quite penetrate the armor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the fifth, I could sense a change of crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">sympathy. I'd stood up well those first two</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounds, and lived to hand it out. They liked</seg><seg type="columnLine">that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toward the end of the round, I moved in</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly, trying a desperate right. It never</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vic put his weight into a right hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow that landed flush on my jaw. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights went out, and the canvas came up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hit me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I didn't even hear the count until it</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached 7 and then I rose too soon. Vic</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in like a cannonball and landed again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stumbled into the ropes at the bell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tim and the handlers worked like beav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers. Tim was muttering something inco-</seg><seg type="columnLine">herent, massaging the back of my neck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I felt the chill of a cold towel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vic came out with a rush for the sixth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He landed heavily with the hook and tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">that right again. I moved in desperately,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the right went around my neck. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vic was beating a sickening tattoo on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach. Then the champ stepped clear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and threw his Sunday punch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again, I managed to step away from it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vic came in carelessly, and I threw a right</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the blob that should have been his jaw.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was. Vic stumbled back three steps, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went into his crouch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I moved in slowly, my head a buzzsaw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my footwork ragged. I kept the left pump-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing automatically, and the right cocked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I got through that round on all the finesse</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd picked up through the years, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed it all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In my corner, Tim said, "this is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">round. This is the one they won't expect</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to mix. How are you feeling, Jimmy?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Are you up to it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think so," I said. "And I hope you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So I went out slowly, and waited to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attack Vic Would launch. But Vic had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same idea in mind. We stalled for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">full minute, while the fans grew restless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Vic moved in and I answered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">challenge. For seconds wc exchanged. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds I slugged it out with the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">slugger in the field. And the slugger came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out second best.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vic was weary when we broke. Vic was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wilting, and my left lanced out sharply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vic tried a wild right, and I crossed over it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It landed, and for a fraction of a second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vic seemed to hesitate. It was all I needed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I put my hundred and forty-seven pounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a Sunday punch. I put all my weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all my hate into it ,and sent it over with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a prayer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They carried Vic to his corner, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ref came over to raise my right arm aloft.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the crowd poured into the ring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw them all through a mist, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one that mattered most was coming to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward me, a smile on her face and arms out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched.

Allan</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In a strange city things are different for a fighter... a fighter like Joe Corey,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">anyway. You take the big Hive, collect the moola, tlrink and forget. But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tonight Joe was home . . . and the marbles were on the table for everyone</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LONELINESS and the reality</seg><seg type="columnLine">trapped him, finally. The train was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, and the song of the rails</seg><seg type="columnLine">could no longer lull his thoughts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here the sharp June sunlight glistened</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the sticky asphalt streets. A sucking</seg><seg type="columnLine">whine was left in the wake of speeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">cars. The tall buildings shimmered in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat waves. His shirt clung limply to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad shoulders. There was not a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar face. No band was here, no may-</seg><seg type="columnLine">or with a gilded key. This was a home-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming for you. And Joe Corey laughed--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rough laugh that ended abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sure, this was the way to come home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Or maybe it was, he thought slowly. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty-six hours it would be over. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">train would take him back to New York.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Between now and then it could be like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall--like a long silent hall that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked through. You didn't open the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors. You made no noise. You passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through and were gone. Yes, that was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed to simplify something in Joe's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. He lifted his worn suitcase from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the curb and moved toward the line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting cabs. The sun glistened in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown sandy hair and deepened the color</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his broad rough face. He carried his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">45</seg><seg type="columnLine">46	FIGHT STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">coat under his arm. He walked with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalking grace, his shoulders leading, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels scarcely meeting the pavement. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a heavy rhythm and power in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat forward in the cab, rubbing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knuckles with the great palm of his left</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. He saw the new post office, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trackless trolleys, and he kept searching</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the strange faces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How many of them would be there to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow night? Twenty thousand? Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps thirty thousand, rising out beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glare of the ring. They would know</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, then. Here and there someone would</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, "Corey. Came from here, remember?</seg><seg type="columnLine">... Sam Krebble, this same guy that's got</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dulaney, he used to manage him. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the top. There was nobody . . . That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was five years ago. Then something hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened in Pittsburgh. I don't know. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">think they ever proved anything . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fingers of his great hands were</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted tightly together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Marsden Hotel was a fat brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure--a shabby old lady resting com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">placently on the outskirts of the business</seg><seg type="columnLine">district. Joe put on his hat and coat before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went in. The lobby was shadowy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooler. He saw the poster, thumb-tacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the bulletin board. The name flamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the top in crimson letters--Baron</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dulaney.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe looked at the curly blond hair in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the picture, at the smooth unbattered face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the level eyes. Below, in smaller letters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Joe's name. He was glad they hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">used a picture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, Joe!" The shrill greeting turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">him around. Little Sam Krebble came</seg><seg type="columnLine">panting across the lobby, his tie askew, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit wrinkled. It might have been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same cigar of five years ago. "To see you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looking so good!" Sam gasped. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">black eyes sparkled as he grasped Joe's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, Sam." Joe smiled and held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile as the little guy's eyes darted over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his frame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "iNever have I seen you looking better,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam pronounced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm allright. For thirty-two, anyway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is but childhood. When you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived as long as Sam . . ." He wagged his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">head mournfully and steered Joe toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the elevator. He explained why he hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">met the train. He mopped his damp jowls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He assured Joe that his indigestion was</seg><seg type="columnLine">definitely worse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe was grateful for the rush of words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE followed Sam into the room that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been reserved for him. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">large and slightly shabby. The windows</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced west. Beneath the glare of the sink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sun the city rolled gently out into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluish haze. Sam turned on the overhead</seg><seg type="columnLine">fan and the blades generated a monoto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nous drone. The air remained thick and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sticky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dorsey will come in later," Sam was</seg><seg type="columnLine">explaining. Dorsey was the man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">would handle him tomorrow night, Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered. "It is all arranged at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Downtown Club, if you want anything.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And about Dorsey--as soon would I trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself. That is right, Joe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll get along. There won't be much</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A silence formed, deepened by the drone</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fan. Sam fretted his cigar. Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">massaged his knuckles until they were wet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he rubbed them against his coat. Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared his throat. "You have seen Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laney ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Once, about three years ago. His last</seg><seg type="columnLine">light before he went into the army."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is faster, now. Heavier. A left like</seg><seg type="columnLine">never before." Sam blinked at him. "For</seg><seg type="columnLine">you it will not be so easy tomorrow night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the Hell, Sam! I know what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">came for. Me tomorrow. Maybe Dorati</seg><seg type="columnLine">next month, then the championship in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall. I'm glad it's your show. Anyway,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said more quietly, "twenty-five hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred dollars can buy a lot of rounds from</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, now." And instantly Joe felt the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pact of the unplanned words. His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked with Sam's. Between them leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the recollection of that night in Pitts-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burgh. The Paski fight. Sam's eyes, elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tric with outrage, his round face apoplec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic, his voice quivering: "Carried him!</seg><seg type="columnLine">You carried him! That money should</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever mean so much to you that you should</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn . . . turn crook!

For ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand dollars. Why? . . . No, it wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">just the money; he could make that. Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wanted to please Silvestri ? Perhaps ...</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was all part of the swift new intoxica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. New friends. New places. The sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den fame.

Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">began. He stopped and rubbed his chin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He sighed and held out his hand. "But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is time for me to go." He held out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. After he had opened the door, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused. "Yesterday I saw Letty. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">asking . . He glanced at Joe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe tightened his fingers. Walk softly</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the hall, he was thinking. Leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door closed. It will soon be over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sam frowned. Slowly he closed the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorsey dropped in just after five o'clock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was a stoop-shouldered man of about</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty, with faded wise eyes and a melan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">choly voice. After they shook hands, Dor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sey seemed ill-at-ease. He sat there, creas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a newspaper between his bony hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blinking at the window. Joe was glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took off his coat, loosened his tie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stretched out on the bed. He unfolded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crumpled newspaper Dorsey had left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the sports section of the Herald.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the left was a box-column, Looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">Them Over With Levlitt. Joe remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben Levlitt from high school--a thin hay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired boy with a touch of wry humor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The column discussed the fight, devoting</seg><seg type="columnLine">three-quarters of its space to an examina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of Dulaney's maturing skill and pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er. The final paragraph looked at Joe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Few fights, it said, have held the irony</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this one. Scarcely five years ago Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corey's star was in its ascendancy. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">championship twinkled just ahead. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a July night in Pittsburgh, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhibited one of the most intriguing fits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of chivalry since the era of King Arthur.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This ten-round waltz marked both the</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning point of Corey's career and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of his association with Sam Krebble,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his manager, and today the manager of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baron Dulaney. Mr. Corey began to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">an intense interest in the Full Life, doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fighting from the west corner of Man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hattan's High Top Club. It is rumored he</seg><seg type="columnLine">chose a liquid diet. Tomorrow night will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be something of a homecoming-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe hurled the paper to the floor. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded cry broke from his jaws. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">did they have to keep riding hifn? Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't they forget?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He covered his eyes with his arm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something kept squeezing in his stomach,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making him hot and breathless. This was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy thing! Why hadn't he realized! A</seg><seg type="columnLine">beating like this for twenty-five hundred.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It wasn't the thing that would happen to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow night in the ring. That was easy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was this--this ripping at his pride.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This . . . And Joe stopped and laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">acidly. That was a word! Pride.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hurled himself from the bed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalked around the room, shaking his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a stunned animal. He looked at him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self in the mirror. His eyes burned dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tormented. The skin of his cheeks felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn and old. He felt desperately tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lonely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PRIDE . . . This time Joe did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh. It was true. He couldn't ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain it, but he knew it was true. And it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was such a fragile thing. Like a scrap of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lace, salvaged and laboriously cleaned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mended with clumsy fingers until a pat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tern was formed again. But it was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">so frail, this pride. And they wouldn't let</seg><seg type="columnLine">it alone. If only--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gentle knock came at the door. Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned, his chest rising and falling heavily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Angrily he jerked the door open. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you--" The raw words evaporated. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped back. His arms sagged to his sides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She wore.no hat. Just a summer dress,</seg><seg type="columnLine">white and soft. From the look in her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, he knew she had been smiling be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore she saw him. Slowly she smiled again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">48	FIGHT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sam told me you would be here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sam ? Oh." He fumbled with his hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her smile was ebbing again. Joe gestured</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaguely. "Yeah, Sam. He made the reserv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation." Her quiet blue eyes searched his.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her fingers rested on the door. Her smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">had faded. "I'm sorry if ... Do you want</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to go, Joe?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't . . . No, please. I was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking when you knocked. I wasn't ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecting ..." He stumbled back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed out a chair. "Sit here, Letty. It's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little cooler under the fan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She closed the door softly. He could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">take his eyes away from her. Had she al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways been so small, so slender? Her hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed so much darker, her eyes so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">more blue. She sat down, tucking her legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">under. She'd always done that. Joe found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself waiting for the plop-plop of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes as she pushed them off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat down. Her job? . . . She didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">work for the oil company. She's been with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her father at the store since he fell and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt his hip. Her mother was fine; she'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered if Joe would come to supper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They talked while the fan droned in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling and the sunlight drained from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows. They talked carefully of little</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. She was living in Crestview, now;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a new addition, built on the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">municipal golf course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He listened to the gentle lilt of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">words. Her face seemed to grow more</seg><seg type="columnLine">lovely, more delicate in the shadows. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he scarcely listened; he thought of the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he had seen her: two years after that</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in Pittsburgh, a month after he'd lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cadillac to Silvestri. It hadn't been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk-out; Joe knew that, now. It had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Christmas songs, the toys in the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows. And the bitter emptiness. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come home. Now, thinking back, Joe was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so grateful that she hadn't been there the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next year.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was dark now. Nests of lights twin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kled on the horizon of the city. "Let's go</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to Dundee's," Joe said. "Remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">those lobsters?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They'd eaten there a lot, the first year</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'd been married. But it was gone now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was called the Crescent Grill, now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now the walls were white. A nickelodeon</seg><seg type="columnLine">wailed loudly. Old Dundee was gone. There</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was a lean sleek-haired man behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cash register.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the little things were said. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at each other. They were silent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then Letty touched his hand. "Tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, really, Joe. Tell me how things are."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wanted to tell her. His throat ached</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a yearning. If only he could make</seg><seg type="columnLine">her believe. "I tried to think. I spent a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time thinking," he began. "I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">take a drink. I haven't . . ." He stopped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It took a long time--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure it's him, like on the poster, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">dope!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe glanced around. There were four</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them--the oldest not more than twelve.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They stood at the side of the booth, star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at him boldly. "Ain't you Joe Corey?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one with the freckles challenged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, that's me." Joe grinned and held</seg><seg type="columnLine">out his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Like I said!" the kid said triumphant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. "My uncle was there. He seen it!" The</seg><seg type="columnLine">words rang through the room. The sleek</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was watching. The waitresses were</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring. "Said it was a fix and a bunch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gamblers sure cleaned up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe was frozen. Something horribly hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploded in his chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My uncle, he told me--" the kid was</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The terrible thing seared into Joe's</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain and blinded him. A cry of rage</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke from his lips. He leaped from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">booth.. The kids scattered, yelling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear, "Joe! Don't let--" Letty cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped and swayed like someone</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked from a nightmare. The room was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with eyes and faces. The kids were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone. He stood there alone in the shame</seg><seg type="columnLine">and silence. He couldn't stand it. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunged toward the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey, we're not running a soup line,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pal. Pay your check," the sleek man</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's all right, Joe," Letty said huskily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll meet you." He didn't wait. He want-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed to run--to run so fast that the wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">would cool the flame of his face; to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far that the voices would be lost for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever. He kept going, stalking deeper and</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper into the old section of the city. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth were clenched, his fists knotted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scent of beer came to him. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">HOMECOMING!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">49</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a little hole-in-the-wall bar. He stopped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chest rising and falling like a bellows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had been so long . . . Suddenly he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">care. It made no difference. They wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">let you forget, no matter what you did.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He walked into the place and sat down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first stool. He ordered a rye and</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. It burned, going down. He ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Getting in your last training licks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corey?" The question was careless, ironic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe twisted around and there stood Ben</seg><seg type="columnLine">Levlitt, the sports-writer. He was grin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning, and his lean face seemed to twitch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Get out. Get away from me," Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How does it feel to be home, Joe?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Levlitt asked dreamily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL the pent-up rage went into Joe's</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow. It caught Levlitt's chin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeled him into the wall. He went down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knees. The bartender yelled angrily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Levlitt stared with stony contempt. Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at his fist. He rubbed his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">across his eyes. Suddenly he felt sick. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling of desolation went through him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dazedly he turned, fumbled with the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went out. He felt heavy and old and</seg><seg type="columnLine">terribly tired. His eyes burned and blurred.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Damn them." But the words, too, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired and empty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was nearly midnight when Joe re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the Marsden. The street was</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty and still. Just within the darkened</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance a man moved slightly, seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lean forward and peer at Joe's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Corey?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah?" The word was hostile. "So</seg><seg type="columnLine">what ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you can spare a minute."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For what?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's take a walk in the park." The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man kept his voice muted. As his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved, a reflection of light gleamed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thick glasses. He was a short man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather plump, with an oval flat face. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't be wasting your time," he assured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe bent forward, trying to recognize</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "W(hat's your name?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Charlie. Come on, Corey. I think you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be interested."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe hesitated. There was something cu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">4--Fight--Fall</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">riously compelling in the muted words.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slowly he turned. They walked together</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the street and into the darkness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a patch of park.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll talk. You can stop me when you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">had enough," the man named Charlie said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"First, would it break your heart to win</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fight tomorrow night? Would you</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind having a few grand riding on your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self at maybe five-to-one?" He paused and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidled a sharp look at Joe. "It could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged. It all depends on you, Corey."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Is Dulaney for sale?" Joe whispered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's a lot easier than that." Charlie</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckled deeply. "It'll take just about</seg><seg type="columnLine">three ,solid rights while you've got him</seg><seg type="columnLine">blindfolded."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think you're a little crazy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Over a period of years I have dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved that theory. Suppose you listen."</seg><seg type="columnLine">His tongue moved over his lips with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moist sucking sound. "My information</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes from one of Dulaney's sparring</seg><seg type="columnLine">partners; first he heard the story, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">badkground. Later, just by accident, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw how this thing would work. He tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">it again; it worked again. It'll work to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow night. Krebble's spotted it, now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it's something that can't be smoothed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in a few days, see? It's like this . . ."</seg><seg type="columnLine">His voice softened deliciously. "You let</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dulaney come across with a left. Then--</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight up in the air with your left hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">see? Like this, wild like--like you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to drive a knife down in his face!</seg><seg type="columnLine">See it? . . . Then he does it. Covers up</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a kid about to get slapped. He throws</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right arm over his eyes. You've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole lunch-hour to bust him. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">all there is, see?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe stared intently at the shadowy face</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him. "Now I know you're crazy."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The story, the background," Giarlie</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued serenely. "It happened in</seg><seg type="columnLine">France. Dulaney's outfit was pinched off</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Battle of the Bulge. He was in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole by himself when a kraut climbed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with a bayonet. He'd been half-sleep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. For just a second Dulaney saw this</seg><seg type="columnLine">blade coming down. He tried to cover. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught him just under the eye. Somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">he nailed the guy, then he passed out. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was cold. He stayed there a long time, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinks, before they found him. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">FIGHT STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">50</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had fever. Nightmares, when he kept see-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that arm upraised, that blade coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. You get it? . . . He hasn't whipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. He will, sure. But not by tomorrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. Something like that takes a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. So . . Charlie cocked his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">alertly. "It takes somebody smart enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to handle him a while, then use this open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. You can do it. And I can get five-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-one on you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe swallowed. His throat was dry. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">flexed his fingers. They were stiff. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole thing, it's crazy," he said thickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll never know until you try it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charlie tilted his head again. "I've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">two thousand to bet for you. It'll bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">you ten. All I'm waiting for is your word."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I don't know. The whole thing ... I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to think," Joe stammered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's okay. Tomorrow morning will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be soon enough. You can call me at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">number . . ." He handed Joe a slip of</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper. "You know, Corey," he said confi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dentially, "you don't owe anybody a damn</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. They brought you in here to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">a beating. They were looking for a soft</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">touch. Why should you-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll make up my mind without the sob</seg><seg type="columnLine">story, Charlie," Joe said abruptly. "I need</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think. I'll call you." He turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked back to the Marsden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE tried to lie down, to think about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it calmly. A tense restlessness surged</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his veins. He got up and paced</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, if it was like that. Just a flaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Charlie said . . . Sure, if you spotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">an opening, you worked it. You always</seg><seg type="columnLine">did that. That was okay. Sure. So what</seg><seg type="columnLine">were you thinking about?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toe tried to understand. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something tauntingly familiar about this</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment--as though he had lived it all at</seg><seg type="columnLine">some other time. It was that time in Pitts-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burgh. "But it's not the same!" he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloud. "This is something different. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">is his weakness. It's nothing I've done.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What if things were turned around? Why</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't he-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes found the crumpled newspaper</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor. There was Levlitt's column.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could hear the taunting words again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How does it feel to be home, Joe?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood very still, his fingers closing</seg><seg type="columnLine">into fists. He felt the slow surge of fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach his cheeks. And he heard the shrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice of the kid again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They would be there tomorrow night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hungry eyes upon him. They hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">let him forget. What did they care about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pride?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If things were turned around ... Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of it again and his fingers cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his palms. "They wouldn't give a</seg><seg type="columnLine">damn!" he cried. His heart pounded. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands were wet. He reached for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telephone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten thousand dollars ... It would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the start. A store, a piece of land. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to get away. No need for this again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gave the number. One minute later</seg><seg type="columnLine">he replaced the receiver. He turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared around the room; he felt cold. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the strangest feeling--as if Letty had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed through this room and listened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The door was locked. It was only a feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Slowly he rubbed his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lights were hot on Joe's bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders. Noise kept flooding down</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the crowded darkness of the stands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He shuffled around his corner, flexing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders, filling his lungs deeply. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach felt light and airy, and a deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">richness of finality filled him. This time</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonight . . . This was the last time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bell jerked at his nerves, then ev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erything seemed to slide into a measured</seg><seg type="columnLine">pattern. He went out slowly to meet Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Dulaney. Dulaney's face was calm. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold hair glistened. His eyes were cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">and appraising. There was a long pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">scar under his right eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stung Joe with a left, crossed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a right, moved off and threw another left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe drew a deep breath. The physical con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tact was strangely reassuring. He went in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his massive shoulders bent, his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">tucked in. Dulaney fed a left. Joe smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lips with a looping right. Dulaney</seg><seg type="columnLine">backed away. Joe breathed hungrily. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was it. This was everything. His muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to sing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The round had been at least a draw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe knew. He breathed easily. His arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt long and tough. He saw Charlie and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little man winked. Then Joe saw Let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty. She was three rows back and to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">HOMECOMING!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">51</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">right. She smiled and her lips formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">some silent word. A momentary quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">strayed through his brain. The bell rang</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He followed Dulaney, found him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">lefts, rocked him backward with long</seg><seg type="columnLine">rights. He stalked him constantly. As the</seg><seg type="columnLine">round wore away, a growing exhilaration</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled his throat. He could take this kid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With half a minute left, Dulaney trapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The right seemed to explode between</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe's teeth. The ring rose and tilted in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision. He went down and a great roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">swelled in his ears. His legs felt numb</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flabby as he struggled up. The bell</seg><seg type="columnLine">rang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorsey worked on him frantically. Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">sucked fresh water as it ran down his lips.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The stands pulsated with a hungry chant:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Get him! Get him!" Joe stared at Dula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney coldly1. The false exhilaration was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shattered. His arms felt like wet pillows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He dragged in a deep breath as the bell</seg><seg type="columnLine">rang. This time. This round. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to be now, he thought fixedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dulaney worked him along the ropes</seg><seg type="columnLine">with cruel jabs. The blows were penetrat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, now. Joe's lungs began to burn. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribs ached. He backed away, licking his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips, watching, waiting, remembering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mid-way through the round the chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dulaney tossed over a left. Joe hesitated</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant, then hurled his left arm high</seg><seg type="columnLine">above his head. With the motion he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">taunted by a sensation of utter folly. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">it happened--so instantly and so incredibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe could scarcely realize. An expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stark dismay splashed over Dulaney's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. He jerked. He stumbled clumsily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His right arm went over his eyes. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">what seemed like an eternity to Joe, Dula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney huddled before him. Joe's muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">coiled and kicked loo.se. His right smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Dulaney's jaw and Dulaney went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A stunned roar broke from the crowd.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dulaney huddled on the canvas, staring at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe with tortured eyes, eyes that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">glazed with dull accusation. The referee</seg><seg type="columnLine">was counting. Dulaney started up. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">poise and calm had left his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Between the rounds Joe's eyes met</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam's. Their impact stung him. The cold</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THIRD MAN OUT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    Abe Attell, king of the little men some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  forty years ago, once kayoed the referee of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  a bout in which he xvas participating, then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  stood by while his opponent counted out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  the ref.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    The year was 1913. It was a hot July</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> night, and Abe was battling Willie Beecher</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> at Arverne, N. Y. For two rounds the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> referee kept pestering Abe for more action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abe, an obliging fellow, stepped up the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> pace. Then, in a flurry of infighting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beecher moved his head and the ref re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ceived one of Abe's rights squarely on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the nose. He hit the canvas and Beecher</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> counted him out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fury of five years ago was rekindled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam's face. He knows, Joe thought queerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Charlie was smiling softly. Joe looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Letty. She sat perfectly still, her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed on him with the strangest look of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder. Then, so very slowly, her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved toward Charlie. Finally she looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Sam. She seemed to be searching for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some interpretation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Midway through the fourth Round Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught Dulaney again. He threw up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left grotesquely. He hurled his right into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dulaney's mouth as Dulaney huddled be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore him. Dulaney fell on his side and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips began to bleed. Joe walked away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw Charlie. The fat face was radi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant. Charlie winked and nodded compla-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cently. Then Joe saw Letty. Her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were fixed on Charlie. Slowly they re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved themselves in his. Her face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashen. Her lips seemed to tremble. Abrupt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly she rose. Her eyes had found their an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swer. She stumbled toward the aisle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something tightened and snapped inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe. His throat went dry. Her name tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fight!" the referee commanded. Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laney was on his feet again. Letty van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished beyond the outskirts of light. Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to fight. All his heart and urge</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have walked away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat in his corner and stared at her</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty seat. All around was the ghosty sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of faces. A strange silence cloaked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd. Something hard and ugly was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawning into realization out there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It made Joe cold, and he looked at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty seat again. The anguish of loneli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">52</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIGHT STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ness strangled him. They hated him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and suddenly he hated himself. This wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing he'd come back for. Suddenly, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">those moments, Joe let himself think</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hadn't wanted to walk unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the hall. He had hoped there'd be</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone to meet him at the station. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">some unspoken way, he had hoped to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">something here. He was so very tired,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he'd wanted to come home. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">J.he last fight, and he didn't want it this</seg><seg type="columnLine">way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorsey was pushing him. Yes, the bell</seg><seg type="columnLine">had rung. He went out. His arms felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">like sacks of concrete. His lungs burned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The mechanical part of his mi'nd kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">prompting. "Now. This round. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">round."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dulaney hit him. Again. Again. Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited. He hurled up his left. A momen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary struggled stained Dulaney's face as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fought to control himself. He lost. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled and covered up. There he wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed. There was his chin. This was it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sob of anguished decision broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Joe's lips. His right arm sagged to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his side. He closed his eyes and shook his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. Noise, like the sharp rustle of leaves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept through the crowd. Then Joe looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Dulaney. The younger man's eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide, incredulous. Joe hit him with a left</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the eternal instant was past. Dulaney</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in. He slammed Joe back. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked him along the ropes. He ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mered at Joe's ribs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the fifth Joe was down. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">down twice in the sixth. His lungs felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">like furnaces. His knees shook. Each jab</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to grind his ribs deeper into raw</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh. The .salt of blood coated his lips.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sixth? . . . Four more left. Four</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. It was forever. The end of forever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was where he had to go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The seventh. Down again. The eighth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harder to make his knees carry him up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hard to see Dulaney through the mist.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No, this was the referee. Joe shook his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head doggedly. He was all right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sam's face swam through his vision.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Or was it Sam? . . . Something had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to the eyes. The face was gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sick. Was he smiling? Joe thought he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was smiling at him. Letty's seat was emp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty. Dulaney kept hitting him. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ninth round, wasn't it? The bell rang.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In an instant, it seemed, it rang again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can make it." Dorsey had said</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. Joe went out to meet the white wraith</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was Dulaney. He threw his tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">fists out. Dulaney slugged him. Joe start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed down, dragged himself up, and bowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his legs apart. He ceased moving and</seg><seg type="columnLine">planted himself to stay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blows ceased to sting. Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hurt. He was going to last. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible sweetness of the realization filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his throat. He wanted to laugh. His lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't move. He did not hear the bell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was alone, in the center of the ring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was still swinging when Sam and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">referee pulled him back, and there was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">endless thunder pouring out of the stands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorsey got him through the ropes. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes began to clear as they started up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long aisle. It was then, and only then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he realized they were shouting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, too. They reached out when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed. This had not happened in a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorsey was tying Joe's shoelaces when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Levlitt came into the silent dressing room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He walked over to Joe and held out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you want to know," he said. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the biggest fight you ever won."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe looked at him and understood what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he meant.

He sat squatly on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stool, scratched his belly and burped</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, impervious to the hostility of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Cribb sprang quickly from his stool at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bell, but the murderer came out slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking his hands a little, as if the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloves bothered him. He came out in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide-legged, spread-armed crouch of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">professional wrestler.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Cribb evaded his initial pawing grasp</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his hands licked out like striking</seg><seg type="columnLine">snakes. The spat-spat was audible all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arena as the gloves landed meatily on</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side of the Murderer's jaw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Murderer's eyes flew wide in sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise, but he just pulled in his head a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little more deeply into his shoulders and</seg><seg type="columnLine">plodded forward, weaving his pincer-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms. Cribb danced around the ends</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his gloves and hooked a hard right to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ear, sent in a straight left. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Murderer turned stolidly and followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him across the ring, hunching his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders higher until his shaven bullet head</seg><seg type="columnLine">was almost buried in mountains of</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscle. Cribb was being careful, very</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful, staying out of range of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutching arms, depending on his longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach to soften up the Murderer for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">decisive later rounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Murderer gathered himself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a rush. It was like the plunging</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge of a rhinoceros, but Cribb ducked</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his reaching arms and swung a</seg><seg type="columnLine">full-bodied left to the pit of the wres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tler's stomach. It was like beating a bass</seg><seg type="columnLine">drum. He smashed a right to the jaw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a left to the mouth, a right to the ;side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head, and threw in three lightning left</seg><seg type="columnLine">jabs as he danced back and around to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of the ring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But it was as if he had been assaulting</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tank with a bean flipper, for the blows</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost themselves in those layers of muscle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Murderer plodded inexorably for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, ever forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cribb was sweating now. It glistened</seg><seg type="columnLine">on every hair and ran down his ribs; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">dripped from the ledges over his eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pebbled his upper lip. He was worried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His Sunday punch had buried itself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">blubber and nothing had happened. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp, cutting punches had no target in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard turret of that round, shaven head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cribb was not imaginative, but he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not like the jolts that jarred his shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">blades every time he conected solidly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wanted to sit down and talk it over</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Rinky Sneed and get some advice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there was no time limit on these</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounds. One man or the other had to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">down before he could get back to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A 1 RINGSIDE, Roaring Mike yell--</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed imploringly, "Stay away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, Tommy-me-bhoy! Stay away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cribb showed his teeth in a wordless</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarl. What the hell did Pudgy think he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was trying to do, sit in the Murderer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lap and croon lullabies ? He shot in a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">left and as he circled, his foot slipped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a frantic moment he floundered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt the Murderer's arm slide asound</seg><seg type="columnLine">AN HONEST FIGHT EVERY NIGHT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">59</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his waist. He twisted, found a hold and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with surging desperation, threw the Mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derer with a cross-buttock. The judge's</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistle screamed shrilly and the round</seg><seg type="columnLine">was over, for the Murderer had touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">knee and hand to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cribb sneered at the cheers that show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered him. He had taken the round, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew how hollow had been that small</seg><seg type="columnLine">victory. He was arm weary from punch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and he had gotten no place. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murderer just sat phlegmatically on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stool and burped. Onions. And with</seg><seg type="columnLine">garlic it was the same. Always burps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The very thought of it made him burp. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook his head irritably.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thirty seconds ran out and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighters went to scratch for the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">round. Cribb's warning jab spat viciously</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the Murderer's head, but too high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too high. It was almost impossible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find his buried chin from that range. Tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a chance, he stepped in, hooking with</seg><seg type="columnLine">rights and lefts. He danced back be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the Murderer's seeking hands could</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle him. He grinned a little. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was better. There could be more of this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Rinky Sneed, his pointed face</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinched with worry, gnawed at his cigar</seg><seg type="columnLine">and glanced malevolently across the ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">--but Roaring Mike's seat was empty. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fled. Rinky grinned thinly. Tomor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row. He'd fix Mike tomorrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> More confident now, Cribb circled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponderous Murderer, then darted in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting a right--but the Murderer had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been lying in wait, and as Cribb came in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he brought up his linked hands and caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">him under the chin with a terrific, sweeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow. Cribb had expected him to grapple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not strike. Cribb's legs flew up and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed head and shoulders into the can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vas. The audience shuddered under a pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed groan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Murderer stared around disgusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, burped, and tramped back to his stool,</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was a hell of a way to rassle. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumpings-on, no kicks in the pusses, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunts, no groans. He belched and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stool creaked beneath him. The next</seg><seg type="columnLine">round was the end. He was tired of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">sissy stuff, and he wanted to go home and</seg><seg type="columnLine">take a bicarbonate of soda.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the dazed Cribb was dragged to his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">corner by his seconds, Roaring Mike</seg><seg type="columnLine">came pounding down the aisle, his collar</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, his face purple, his paunch heav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the exertion. He galloped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cribb's corner, uncorking a small bottle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He thrust Rinky Sneed roughly aside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarling:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ye want yer tramp to win doncha, ye</seg><seg type="columnLine">under-sized dose of arsenic? Git outta</seg><seg type="columnLine">me way!" Dabbling liquid from the bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle on Cribb's gloves, he whispered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let him grapple with ye next round, me</seg><seg type="columnLine">bhoy, and whin he does, shove yer gloves</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his fat snoot. That's all ye gotta</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. Mind me words now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sneed watched with beady eyes, not at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempting to interfere. If Cribb lost now</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had his rival in a box, a box filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the barbs and poison of scandal, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mike had no right in Cribb's corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said loudly, "Leave the boy alone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mike!" and noted with satisfaction that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reporters in the press row had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were staring curiously. That did it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cribb went groggily to scratch at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistle, groggily but grimly. Grapple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eh? He eyed the Murderer's flat, im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">passive features. There'd be some changes</seg><seg type="columnLine">made there before they got to grips. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">chopped a stinging right and left to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murderer's nose and arched his back as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wrestler's arms went around him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murderer braced his legs and settled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face against Cribb's chest with a satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied grunt. He cross-locked his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and constricted. For a terrifying mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, Cribb fought against that awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure. His ribs sprang and his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood out on stalks. He beat against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the Murderer's head with impo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent gloves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mike roared, "Under his snoot, ye stu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pid ape, under his snoot!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The voice came faintly through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of jagged cymbals that crashed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cribb's brain, and weakly he pushed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloves under the Murderer's nose. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">response was instantaneous. The Murderer</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked up his chin and sharply drew back</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head. He strained away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloves, but Cribb kept them glued to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper lip. The Murderer's expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed from that of distaste to one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror and agony. He turned green and</seg><seg type="columnLine">60</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIGHT STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">finally, releasing his lethal grasp, stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered back, wiping furiousy at his nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his fore arm. Thunderous, rum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling sounds came from his lips. Cribb</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursued him as fast as his shaking legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">would go. The Murderer covered his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">with crossed arms and retreated. Round</seg><seg type="columnLine">and round the ring he stumbled, rum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling like a train in a tunnel. Cribb boxed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him into a corner and hammered pile-</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving rights and lefts into that agon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized face, to the tilted shelf of the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">protected chin. The Murderer looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost grateful as his knees crumbled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sank into unconsciousness, signalled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a monumental burp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rinky Sneed snatched the little bottle</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Roaring Mike's hand and snarled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What did you rub on Cribb's gloves?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">His pointed nose dipped to the lip of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle. His features convulsed and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust out the bottle at arms length.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Peeyoo!" he gasped, "Garlic!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Essence of garlic," corrected Mike</seg><seg type="columnLine">complacently, "Poison for a bilious stom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ach like the Murderer's, poor lad!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next day, Rinky Sneed brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">out another innovation in ballyhoo, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid advertisement in the form of a two-</seg><seg type="columnLine">column sports gossip feature in the Cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter City New,s.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT RINGSIDE</seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH</seg><seg type="columnLine">RINKY SNEED</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What prominent manager-promoter,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wrote, "sprang a ringer on Young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom Cribb, Classic champion of Center</seg><seg type="columnLine">City, and got his comeuppance ?

This wasn't running on schedule.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A body slam, he remembered, a body slam</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done for Keogh the last time.

This had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken many a man by surprise, but Dinny</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped toward him, swaying his hips just</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fraction, evading the grasp, and shot out</seg><seg type="columnLine">a straight-arm as they crossed. Dinny</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed as Cribb pancaked, face-down, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canvas. The whistle shrilled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cribb, dazed, lurched to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Roaring Mike kneaded Dinny's heaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach and whispered, "And jist exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that one, Dinny-bhoy?

He grinned. This was what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">really liked. That other stuff was okay</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the clowns Rinky Sneed had</seg><seg type="columnLine">matched him with, but against a boy like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dinny a real stand-up fight was the thing!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He bobbed under Dinny's reaching jab</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lanced in a straight left that took</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dinny high on the forehead, snapping his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head back, drove in a right to the body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but took in return a slashing right and</seg><seg type="columnLine">left that rocked him to his heels. This</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">monkey could punch! He moved more</seg><seg type="columnLine">warily. He bobbed, feinting, and grin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ned as he sank a left to the heart, but in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next instant his grin was nailed to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth by a crashing left. He back-ped-</seg><seg type="columnLine">elled and the grin stayed where it was.

This was a fight now!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dinny let himself be driven back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ropes, then chopped twice for the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cribb's head and turned as Cribb went</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the ropes from the force of his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentum. Dinny straightened him up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a short right that had bone, muscle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sinew behind it. It took Cribb on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the neck and sent him lurching</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the corner. Dinny followed relent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly, stabbing over the feeble defense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Cribb's raised arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He drove a left to the heart, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cribb's arms came down, he shot a</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight, ramming right to the jaw. Cribb</seg><seg type="columnLine">toppled into him and he stepped back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">raising his arms, and Cribb went to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. The judge's whistle shrieked into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pandemonium--there was no count</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this scrap--and Dinny trotted to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The seconds dragged Cribb to his cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner and Rinky Sneed, his cigar cast aside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked frantically over him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cribb was able to stand at the bell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gamely but blindly, he wavered to iscratch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when the referee stepped back, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurched at Dinny, still punching, still try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Dinny caught him under the arm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pits, held him up and turned his head in</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeal to the referee.

To begin with, he was outnumbered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Originally, there had been something like eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">Americans in his party but four of them, in wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their surreptitious way to a swampy island</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a marshy part of the Seine River in France</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the illegal match was to be held, got lost.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus, of the 100 or so spectators who did get</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, virtually all were Englishmen, deeply parti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">san, in their sentiments and in their financial</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagers, to the Britisher, Jem Smith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The year was 1887, when the boxing glove was</seg><seg type="columnLine">first beginning to be used. In fact, back in</seg><seg type="columnLine">America, what fighting Jake Kilrain had done</seg><seg type="columnLine">always had been with gloves. This was to be his</seg><seg type="columnLine">first bare knuckle encounter and also, as a matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fact, his first appearance in a professional</seg><seg type="columnLine">prize ring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Englishmen, consisting pretty much of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobility, were quite certain that their man, highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">touted the world over, would waste little time and</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience no difficulty in finishing off the raw</seg><seg type="columnLine">lummox from across the waters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, although Smith landed a blow at the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">set that closed one of Kilrain's eyes, it became</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident quickly that the game American was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be far from a pushover and, indeed, that Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going to need all his ring lore and stamina to</seg><seg type="columnLine">survive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As one of the chroniclers of the event reported,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"When Kilrain came up for the next round there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something in the expression of his good eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">that caused Smith's seconds to warn him." In</seg><seg type="columnLine">every round from the fourth through the 11th</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kilrain knocked Smith down at least once and</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the 50th round he had knocked him down more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than 30 times. The last portion of the fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to follow just about the same pattern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, while Kilrain was doing plenty all right</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his ring opponent, that is, against one</seg><seg type="columnLine">specific one, namely Jem Smith, he was having</seg><seg type="columnLine">discomforting moments with Smith's seconds, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular a chappie named Baldoch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seems that in those days if the two pugilistic</seg><seg type="columnLine">opponents got into a clinch they would wrestle</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other trying to break out of it and if both</seg><seg type="columnLine">men went down, which frequently happened, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seconds ran into the ring and brought their</seg><seg type="columnLine">man back to his corner. Well, it seems that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith's second, Baldoch, would use his oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity in the ring to do nefariously mischevious</seg><seg type="columnLine">things to Kilrain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At the end of the 32nd round," went an ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">count of the fight, "Kilrain staggered to his feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half blinded. 'Mr. Atkinson,' he addressed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">referee, 'that man Baldoch rammed his finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">into my eye as I lay there and tried to gouge it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">out. You can see for yourself.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "His left eye was streaming with blood. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">right eye had been closed for an hour. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound in the eye was on the lower lid where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nails of Smith (apparently not a paragon of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentlemanly attributes, either) had dug into it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fortunately, he had not succeeded in piercing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyeball. Atkinson reproved Baldoch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, reproof or not, it appeared Baldoch could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be contained from his rather underhanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">practices. At one juncture Charley Mitchell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kilrain's handler, leaped into the ring and cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">out: "You dare not maltreat my man. 1 blush</seg><seg type="columnLine">to acknowledge that you are Englishmen. Here's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lad who has come three thousand miles over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seas to fight your champion. He never even saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a prize fight before. He has no friends here</seg><seg type="columnLine">while there's one hundred against him. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to have his right or I've got to get licked</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as he."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even this stirring declaration did not deter the</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined Baldoch and at the end of the 38th</seg><seg type="columnLine">round, while in the ring supposedly to pick up</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gladiator, was seen trying to break a finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Kilrain. This was too much for Mitchell and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he jumped into the ring and took a swing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baldoch, knocking him out of the ropes. Baldoch</seg><seg type="columnLine">got back in and the two seconds went at it ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer and tong, threatening to eclipse in fierceness</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main event, but ringsiders finally brought it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a halt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the fight passed the 100-round mark there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no doubt that, from one quarter and another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the American had absorbed quite a bit of punish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. "Kilrain's right eye was puffed like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">miniature 'balloon," a journalist wrote. "His</seg><seg type="columnLine">left eye could open itself only partially. His jaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like a piece of raw beefsteak and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were bumps on his forehead the size of eggs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A continual stream of blood flowed from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right car where it was torn. There were blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">smears all over, his body although it was kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">continually sponged."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, although Smith only had one opponent in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ring to contend with, the journalist went on to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say that the Englishman's appearance "was even</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse," indicating very strongly that Kilrain had</seg><seg type="columnLine">got much the better of the embroglio. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">106th round Kilrain knocked Smith down again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Britisher seemed to have trouble getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">up but the fight was stopped and called a draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">"because of darkness."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A heartbreaking denouement for Jake Kilrain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it goes without saying, and a rather strange fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the way around, but perhaps the most curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of it was the presence at the ring of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather small Englishman with patches of hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his cheekbones.

While Tom was putting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of heavy gloves on him, Jim looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">across at his opponent.

As a matter of fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't have anything very good right now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Besides, how did I know you were gonna</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull your punches and tap around? You</seg><seg type="columnLine">said you'd been trained by Solly Mason."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy's face froze. "I said I had some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">exhibitions with him in the Army-1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't say he trained me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Uh-huh," said Old Tom. "Did Solly</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever pull a punch?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," said Jimmy, "when he wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cut me up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Tom wisely refrained from any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more questions. "Okay," he said, "I'll get</seg><seg type="columnLine">you some fights. You can use that locker</seg><seg type="columnLine">and train here. A lot of the good boys</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">train here at times-even Solly Mason!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Tom got Jimmy fights all right, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy took them on in business-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion. Jimmy always gave the customers</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good show. He had a knockout wallop</seg><seg type="columnLine">in either hand and he bowled over the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">he met. Within a year Jimmy's name be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came known in the East.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Tom stopped him at the gym one</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. "Say," he said, "Solly Mason's going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to train here for the Jenkins fight. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for good sparring partners. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said Jimmy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He pays pretty good money to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparring partners," said Tom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He should," said Jimmy shortly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he walked away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Solly Mason came in to train every</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon, belting kids around the ring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">punching them silly even with the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloves. To Solly fighting was a joy. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was a born killer and liked to punch a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man around. To Jimmy it was a business</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he set about to win a fight in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">easiest possible manner for both him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his opponent. He didn't have the color</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Solly Mason, but Old Tom recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">in him already a possible challenger for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mason's crown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy deliberately avoided the loud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouthed champion. He fooled with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bags in the morning and did a little spar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring, trying to teach Old Tom's kids some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, then quit about the time Solly was</seg><seg type="columnLine">due. He hid in the showers under a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cascade of water while Solly dressed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out when the champion had gone into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gym. Then Jimmy dressed and left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About a week after Solly went into</seg><seg type="columnLine">training, Jimmy was leaving and stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a corner a moment to watch Solly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the gym, pummel a sparring part-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner. Even with the heavy gloves, Solly</seg><seg type="columnLine">was giving the kid a bad time and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a little groggy. Jimmy turned away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little sick with the remembrance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventy-three times he had gone through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same thing with Solly, but with fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing gloves. Exhibitions! Exhibitions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">how Solly Mason could knock a man out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or cut him up, or beat him groggy. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy had been in the army and his orders</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to climb in the ring and fight Solly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mason whenever an exhibition was sched-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy opened the door and almost ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a girl standing there. She must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been peeking in the window and Jimmy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">preoccupied, had bumped her head, knock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her silly hat askew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sorry," he said, grabbing her by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the elbows to keep her from falling, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't see you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's all right." She gave him a smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Jimmy's heart did three quick nip-ups.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was peaches and cream. Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't tear himself away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can I help you with anything?" He</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Possibly you can," she said, straighten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the hat on her rich brown hair. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was classic except for a nose that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just a little too snubbed, and to Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was the prettiest thing he'd ever seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm looking for Solly Mason."</seg><seg type="columnLine">70</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIGHT STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy's heart did a quick dive into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit of his stomach. "Oh, no," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked surprised. "Oh, yes, I am.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What's so surprising about that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well" said Jimmy, still not believing,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"it just-1 mean, you don't look-,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he stumbled thinking of the type of girl</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Solly usually dated-and he still didn't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">believe it. The girl was nice. She was-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nice!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a sudden thought came to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What did you want to see him about?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">His voice was hopeful, looking for ail</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy explanation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her surprise deepened. "Don't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that's my business?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, sure, I just meant-1 mean,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought maybe I could help you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You can. If you'll tell Mr. Mason I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">here I shall be grateful. My business with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him is personal."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh." Jimmy's face hardened. "Thank</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. I'll tell him." He turned away and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strode across the gym to where Solly was</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting until another partner was ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him. Jimmy's mind was so busy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was so angry that he was halfway</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the gym before he remembered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was going to talk to Solly Mason! His</seg><seg type="columnLine">stride faltered and he almost stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Solly Mason! A hard, cold lump formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his throat at the thought of Solly's ugly</seg><seg type="columnLine">face leering at him across a pair of gloves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was tired, so tired, and his face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleeding from cuts that didn't have time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to heal between bouts. The doughboys</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hollering and he tried to get his</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard in the right place, but Solly kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashing it aside and flicking those gloves</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his bloody face. Jimmy couldn't lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and quit in front of all these GI's.</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his legs were rubbery and his arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy, and Solly just danced around,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flicking and cutting and making himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">look good instead of delivering the coup</seg><seg type="columnLine">de grace and ending it all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JIMMY shook his head to clear it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that he was at ringside. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard Solly's hoarse, rough voice and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jimmy," Solly yelled. He threw his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head back and guffawed. "Well I'll be a,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooden saw-horse, if it isn't old Jimmy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hi, Sol," said Jimmy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say," said Solly "you're just the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm looking for. I need a good sparring</seg><seg type="columnLine">partner. Come on, I'll fix you up in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">togs and you can show these bums how</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No thanks," said Jimmy coldly. "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">not in the army now I don't have to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">in there and let you show off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Solly allowed surprise in exaggerated</seg><seg type="columnLine">proportion to cross his face. "Let me?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He guffawed again. "Don't take it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart, Jimmy. Besides, it seems to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">you used to fight back now and then and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	had to give you a lesson." Solly let his</seg><seg type="columnLine">raucous laugh peal out again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sure, he had fought back before he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">too tired, before the tricks and pounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Solly wore him down. He had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">no match for the experience and ability</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the older man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You gotta admit, Jimmy, you learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you were fighting the champion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," said Jimmy. "I learned a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">things." He had at that. The last eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">or nine exhibitions he had been giving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">champion a rough time. He tagged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">champ every now and then and once he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had nearly put the great Solly Mason on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ropes. But Solly had what it took and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he always came back to lace Jimmy un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercifully in the later rounds. It never</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid to fight back, although Jimmy always</seg><seg type="columnLine">did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Watcha doing Jimmy? Still fighting?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Solly was curious about this fighter who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never quit during seventy-three beat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah," said Jimmy, "I'm still fighting."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he remembered why he had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">over. "Just came to tell you that there's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl at the door waiting for you." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicated the girl and watched Solly</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely. Solly looked over and his chest</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffed up. He had always been proud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his women. This one he could afford to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be proud of. A leer came to Solly's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She the current rage?" Jimmy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">goaded into the question by something he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Solly looked down at him and guffawed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sure, Jimmy, you know how I was with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the women." He waved his glove and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted across the gym. "Hi'ya, Honey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LADY LIKES BLOOD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">71</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">come on over."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was enough for Jimmy. He turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">away and started back across the gym.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He met the girl halfway and she didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">look as though she were advancing eagerly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to meet a lover.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you," she said coldly to Jimmy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy stopped doggedly and regarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. She stopped too, uncertain. Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at her well-dressed figure, looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">into her clear, hazel eyes and shook his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. "No sir," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I beg your pardon?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No sir, you don't look like the kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of girl that would fall for a lout like Solly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mason." Jimmy's eyes were cold and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hostile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her eyes widened in surprise for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment and then anger swept across her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. She turned on her heel and walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Solly Mason.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About two days before the Jenkins fight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy found out who the girl was. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers were full of pictures of her, pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures of Solly Mason, the middleweight</seg><seg type="columnLine">champion, and of the two together. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Adele Lemuir, an actress who seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a champion in her own field al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though Jimmy didn't care much for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name, and she announced her engagement</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Solly. She was opening a new show</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Broadway the night after the Jenkins</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Solly announced to the world that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would be there, win, lose or draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">against Jenkins. She would be at ringside</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cheer Mason on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy attended the fight. She was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only there but climbed into the ring and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was introduced to the cheering crowd as,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"the champion's fiancee who is opening a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new show on the great white way tomor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy prayed fervently that Jenkins</seg><seg type="columnLine">would knock Solly's head off. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't. Jenkins was a rough, tough slugger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made to order for Solly. Solly was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand-up fighter who cut Jenkins to pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the hitter tried to get in close. Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to admire the way Solly's feet were</seg><seg type="columnLine">always in position to hit a solid blow with</seg><seg type="columnLine">either hand, the lightning way Solly's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands moved to block and hit, the ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">generalship of the man. He knocked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Jenkins out in the sixth. He was a cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pion all right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next week Old Torn called Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the office. "Jimmy," he said, "we got</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chance for a big fight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can take Jenkins on in the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">event at the Garden two months from</seg><seg type="columnLine">now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy was surprised. "How come?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Old Tom shrugged. "You've built a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good reputation since you've been here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Your record from the Coast is good. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to build Jenkins back up for another</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot at Mason's title."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Jimmy's turn to shrug. "Okay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll take him on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Tom's eyes narrowed. "You realize,</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't you that they figure Jenkins can</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat you or they wouldn't make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">match ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy stood up. "That goes two ways.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think I can beat him, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So do I," said Old Tom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This surprised Jimmy. "Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said Tom, "did you notice how</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was kind of made to order for Solly?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you ever figure out that you fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great deal like Solly Mason? You don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight a man seventy-three times while</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're learning without picking up some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy looked down at his closed fist.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I don't force a fight the way Solly does."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No, you counter-punch more. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">why I figure you'll beat him when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"When we meet?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Tom shook his head wisely. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to happen, Jimmy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy snorted. "Not unless it's an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hibition," he said. He walked out on Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom, that cold lump of lead back in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JIMMY stood in his corner, waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bell. He looked across the ring at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the husky, gnarled figure of Jenkins and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a million thoughts raced through his mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This man was fighting for another shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Solly Mason. If Jimmy let him win,</seg><seg type="columnLine">72	FIGHT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy would never have to fight Mason</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the bell rang and Jimmy was out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the crowd yelling. He moved warily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping his feet in position, watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">older man come in, alert for the opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jenkins just plodded in and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging. Jimmy picked off and countered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then retreated. Picked off, countered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreated. He moved out of a corner and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped to beat Jenkins in the head, taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few blows to the body that didn't carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much sting. With surprise Jimmy real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized that Jenkins was no longer a fighter,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he was too old, washed up-he shouldn't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">even be in the ring. Jimmy could hit him</seg><seg type="columnLine">at will.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So that's the kind of stuff Solly was</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding his title against, Jimmy thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy had met several promising young</seg><seg type="columnLine">middleweights that could do better than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jenkins. And had beat them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end of the first round Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back to his corner breathing easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unmarked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're doing fine," said Tom as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponged him off. "Just keep moving and</seg><seg type="columnLine">picking off. You're way ahead of him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don't let him get in close and you've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to worry about."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sure, Jimmy thought, stay away and cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">him up, just like Solly Mason. Wear him</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and then knock him out, make it</seg><seg type="columnLine">look good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tom" said Jimmy, "how many rounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">did it take Mason to knock out this pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looka ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Six!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I'm going to do it in two!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy was out at the bell and walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the ring to meet Jenkins. Instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of moving away, Jimmy closed in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat the older man to the punch. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasted a right hand to the face and hooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">a left deep in Jenkin's stomach. Jenkins</seg><seg type="columnLine">countered to the body and Jimmy hooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">a savage right that caught Jenkins right</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the button. Jenkins' eyes glazed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he reached for a clinch. Jimmy stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the arms and threw a long left</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the top of them to the head. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd was sensing the kill and were on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their feet screaming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy moved inside again, put the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the body and hooked the right to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaw. Jenkins' knees buckled and he held</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. The referee separated them. Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">went right back in and hooked the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the head. Then he brought a right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand up that had behind it every bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">timing and every ounce of weight that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy owned. Jimmy twisted his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">into it and it snapped Jenkin's head back</seg><seg type="columnLine">savagely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jenkins went back into the ropes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then slowly dropped to his knees. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached automatically behind him for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ropes, missed, and fell forward on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. He lay still while the referee counted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JIMMY stretched out on the davenport</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his small bachelor's diggings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">read the papers. Usually his wins were</seg><seg type="columnLine">just in with the fight results. Sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">he got a write-up. But this time he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">headlines on the sports pages. His knock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of Jenkins was described variously as</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Unexpected", "Thrilling", "Savage", and</seg><seg type="columnLine">an "Upset". Jenkins said after the fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was the hardest he had ever been</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit. The papers named him as the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to meet Solly Mason.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy frowned. If there was one man</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knockout wouldn't fool, it was Mason.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mason had just fought Jenkins, he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">how impotent that older man's blows had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become, how slow he w'as, how easy it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to knock out Jenkins. It wouldn't fool</seg><seg type="columnLine">Solly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Apparently it didn't fool Solly and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Champion still considered Jimmy a set-up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seventy-three times he had his way with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy that's a habit hard to break. Solly's</seg><seg type="columnLine">manager announced the next day that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was willing to meet Jimmy. Old Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">called Jimmy to his office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said Old Tom, indicating a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheaf of newspapers on his desk, "Mason</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't kidding the press. I had a call</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his manager."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy was silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you think?" Tom asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy shifted his weight. "Jenkins was</seg><seg type="columnLine">washed up," he said, "Solly knew that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm not as good as I looked against</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jenkins-Solly knows that."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LADY LIKES BLOOD	73</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe not, but neither is Solly then."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Solly sees a good gate and an easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">win," said Jimmy bitterly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It won't be so easy, if he does win,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Old Tom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Do you think I'm ready?" It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy who was uncertain this time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How old are you now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Twenty-six."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you're not ready now, you never</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">will be. You should be at your peak-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and maybe four more years. Then you</seg><seg type="columnLine">start slipping down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mason's twenty-nine," said Jimmy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's still a good fighter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," agreed Old Tom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe I better not fight him," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom looked Jimmy up and down slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy was ashamed of his cowardice but</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven by it nevertheless. He could feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blood stinging seventy-three different</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuts on his face now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No guts?" Old Tom's two distinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">words dropped into the stillness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office like gun shots on a quiet fall morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy's face jerked up and anger, anger</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hide the shame, convulsed it. Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped to his feet. "No guts, that's right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I got no guts to fight Mason. But go</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead, sign me up, I'll fight him." Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned across the desk and pounded it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Go ahead, I'll fight him. Sign me up."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy turned and left the office, the quiet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">accusing eyes of Old Tom following him</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the stairs and into the street. Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">jammed his hands into his trouser pockets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and walked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked without direction or aim,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind a tumult, the hurrying crowds</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him unheeded, until suddenly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was face to face with a life-sized picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Adele LeMuir. He looked around and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that he was standing in front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">theatre where her show was playing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl had often been in Jimmy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts since that day he met her at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gym. Now almost without thinking, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled a bill out of his pocket and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ticket window. There was a matinee</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he purchased a seat in the front row.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy sat among the scattered patrons</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the afternoon performance and watched</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">her slim beauty and grace as she performed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her part. It was a comedy, and the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Jimmy laughed heartily at different</seg><seg type="columnLine">times. But Jimmy glowered through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire show, hearing none of the words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes fastened on each movement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her face, remembering the clean cut lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hazel eyes of the girl. Jimmy drank</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fill and when it was over he rose to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TO HIS surprise an usher stopped him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he reached the aisle. The usher</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed Jimmy a small, folded and deli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cately perfumed piece of paper. Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the paper and there was a note</seg><seg type="columnLine">penned hurriedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Please see me after the show. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">usher will lead you backstage." It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed: "Adele."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy was more than surprised, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazed. He would have bet money that</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he had met Adele LeMuir in the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">she wouldn't recognize him. And he hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed that she had paid any attention to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the audience. Yet she had apparently seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">him there and had written him that note.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy meekly followed the usher.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was led through the confusion back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage to a door with the traditional star</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it. The usher knocked and Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard Adele call out. The usher opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door and Jimmy went in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a very lovely room, obviously a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressing room. Adele sat in front of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge, mirrored dressing table. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearing a fluffy dressing robe that covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">her from throat to ankles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello," she said to Jimmy, "sit down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat and she smiled at him with great</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoyment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's so funny?" He asked sourly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You," she said. "I don't think I ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw anyone get as little enjoyment from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a performance. I don't think you smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You were watching me?" He was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credulous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Intently," she said. "If everybody's</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaction was like yours, the show would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have closed its first day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was getting my enjoyment another</seg><seg type="columnLine">way," said Jimmy, thawing a little and</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving in to the joke on him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">74</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIGHT STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Indeed. What way was that?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Watching you," he said, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished he hadn't.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She dropped her eyes but then returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">her gaze to his with the same mocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile. "Even though I'm engaged to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Solly Mason?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy shook his head slowly, the frown</seg><seg type="columnLine">returning to his face. "That's' something</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll never understand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's why I asked you to come here,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said, the smile leaving her face, "to</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"To explain? To me?" The surprises</seg><seg type="columnLine">since Jimmy had entered this theatre were</seg><seg type="columnLine">piling up on him. "Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She hesitated before answering and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were steadily on his. "I don't know</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">-do you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He held her eyes a long moment. "Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe I do. Maybe the same reason I</seg><seg type="columnLine">came here this afternoon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was a silence as they both digested</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this. Then she laughed quickly and turned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">away to her mirror, picking up a brush</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and smoothing her hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"It was a publicity stunt, the engage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. Our press agents cooked it up. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">show was opening the next night and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">figured it would help the box office for</seg><seg type="columnLine">both the fight and the show."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Did it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"It did for the show. It isn't a particu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">larly good show, yet we've had a decent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rim. I think we'll close sometime next</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">month."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Do you think it was worth it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She stopped combing her hair. "Aren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">there some things necessary to your pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fession that you don't care for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Okay." Jimmy shrugged his shoulders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I guess you're right. I just couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure it out. Then you're not going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She shuddered. "Perish the thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He's-he's very coarse. I had to go out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with him a few times with plenty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">photographers around."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm glad you agree with me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She turned to face him again. "I do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, I probably wouldn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded it so much if you, a complete</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger, hadn't been so outspoken. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">kept worrying me-and when I saw you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in the audience today I had to tell you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once again their gazes locked in a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment of silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are you eating tonight?" Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wherever you are," she answered gaily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's a deal," Jimmy said, and Solly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mason was forgotten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning Jimmy called Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the phone. "Have you signed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Solly Mason fight yet?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do it this morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do it this morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Tom's voice became joyous. "That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy, Jimmy. I knew you'd do it, boy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew you'd fight him. I'll call right</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, Jimmy boy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fight was scheduled for January</seg><seg type="columnLine">1st in the Garden. Mason had insisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon waiting until January for income tax</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasons. By that time Adele was rehears-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a new play and Jimmy saw her as fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quently as training allowed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One night a gossip columnist saw them</seg><seg type="columnLine">together. The next day he ran a query</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to why Solly Mason's fiancee was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">out with his next opponent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Solly called Adele and complained. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him they should publicly call off their</seg><seg type="columnLine">engagement and that was the next story</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hit the papers. The sports writers be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to bill it as a grudge fight because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pretty actress. The stories made</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberal mention of her next show and</seg><seg type="columnLine">called her the "Fighter's Lady."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy didn't care for any of this. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to him that her whole life was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sham, just like a role in one of her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">plays. Even her name was false-Adele</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LeMuir was something her press agent</seg><seg type="columnLine">had dreamed up. But Adele was genuine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when he was with her Jimmy forgot</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> January 1st approached and Jimmy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">training became intense. He was worried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was worried not because of the fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">or because he might lose, he was worried</seg><seg type="columnLine">bccause he knew that he had a physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear of Mason. He knew it was unreason-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, that he was a much better fighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LADY LIKES BLOOD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">75</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">than when he was in the army, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't control the reaction he had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">night after night when he climbed into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring against the champion. It was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On New Year's morning Jimmy was up</seg><seg type="columnLine">early after a restless night. He had risen</seg><seg type="columnLine">at midnight to lean out the window and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch New York welcome the New Year.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had slept little after that, the night's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight revolving in his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He picked up the morning papers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned nervously to the sports page. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a huge picture of Adele standing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a night club table, a glass of champagne</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her hand, New Year's Eve revelers all</seg><seg type="columnLine">around her, announcing that Solly Mason</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Jimmy McNear were fighting for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand that night, that she went to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winner. The caption said: "Fighter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lady says, 'Winner, Take All Of Me'."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then there was a mention of her new</seg><seg type="columnLine">show, opening the next night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy went to the phone and snatched</seg><seg type="columnLine">it up, gripping the receiver until his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knuckles were white. Then he slammed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">back down without calling her. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been on a merry-go-round ever since he</seg><seg type="columnLine">met her. She always protested her inno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cence, but that stuff wouldn't come out</seg><seg type="columnLine">without her consent. And look at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture, she must have been at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night club.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He picked up another paper and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the same picture from a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle. Her skirts were raised high to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show her beautiful legs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later in the morning the phone rang</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Jimmy ignored it, jamming on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat and leaving the apartment. She would</seg><seg type="columnLine">say she had nothing to do with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was at the gym when one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trainers yelled at him that some dame</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted him on the phone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell her I never talk to anyone on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight day," said Jimmy tightly. "Tell her</seg><seg type="columnLine">my press agent doesn't like it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy waved a hand at the trainer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tell her!" The trainer shrugged his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders and went back to the phone. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">little later he reported.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This dame says to tell you she's sorry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's tough," said Jimmy, closing his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mind to the thought of hurting Adele.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JIMMY climbed woodenly into the ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night. He could already feel the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapier fists of Solly Mason cutting him</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and he didn't much care whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">he won or lost. He knew from long ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perience how fast Mason could feint and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hit-how hard Mason could hit and how</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it felt when things suddenly blanked out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you came to a few seconds later in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an awkward position on the floor with no</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea of how you got there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Then suddenly Adele was on the ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps and had hold of Jimmy's arm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Jimmy," she said, "Jimmy, you've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to listen to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy looked at her and saw she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to tears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He didn't say anything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Jimmy, that picture was faked."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A photographer had seen them and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashbulb burst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"That one wasn't," said Jimmy. "There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">another thousand dollars worth of publicity</seg><seg type="columnLine">and another week for your show."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Jimmy don't! They have hundreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictures of me in different poses. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dubbed in that background-don't you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">understand? I was home all last night."</seg><seg type="columnLine">More pictures were being taken and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy's face froze into a mask.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Jimmy, I fired my press agent.

The youngster</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove needle-point lefts into his face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinging, sneered as he spun to the left out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of range, away from the ropes, back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle of the ring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perry Walsh grinned at Travis, tight</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental checkrein on his temper.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't punching at me, Perry realized, he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">walloping at my temper. Perry half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched, shuffled forward, let a hail of</seg><seg type="columnLine">jabs rattle high across his forehead and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulled his man into the ropes. Pie ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half-dozen murderous lefts and rights</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Travis' belly before they clinched,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as the referee worried them out of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">a backhand flick slapped sweat into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. A deliberate foul. Perry grinned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the bell Travis dropped his gloves</seg><seg type="columnLine">and headed toward his corner, a swagger</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his walk, because the championship was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one round nearer. Perry turned to his cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner more slowly, economizing on strength,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sat down. Buzz, his second, sloshed</seg><seg type="columnLine">water into his mouth, hard hands lifted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest to make room for deep gulps of air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perry casually gazed out into the smoky</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimness. A full house. His cut would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good one, and he needed it. "Lotsa shoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">for baby," he thought and pictured his wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening to the radio, alone, anxious . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulling for him not to go crazy again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Little Katy would be asleep in her crib.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was still early in the evening when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Dick had sat down at one of the tables</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his little restaurant to count the day's</seg><seg type="columnLine">receipts. Dick ran the place for him. It was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted when the three robbers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked in, guns gripped tight in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, coat collars turned up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt good, strong, as he sat in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner. Buzz was working over him hard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">kneading his legs. His eyes wandered out</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the crowd again. The dirtiest man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ring, they called him . . . The Bum.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, what the hell, why not, he'd thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">for so many years. He'd been born into</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirt, the filth of the East Side. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nine life had taught him how to fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">life--with every weapon on hand, fists, feet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brains and even clawing fingernails--after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gang of street toughs broke his nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a blackjack, stole his clothes, and left</seg><seg type="columnLine">him naked in the gutter. At eleven he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered he had an ally, an ungovern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able temper which shot dynamite into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard fists and coated pain with a dulling</seg><seg type="columnLine">redness. The magnet of money had lured</seg><seg type="columnLine">him into the ring and fans such as these</seg><seg type="columnLine">had poured more into his pockets. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">booed him, they hated him, but they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see him fight. Because when he got mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">he forgot the rules, forgot he was fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">a foe with padded gloves and was battling</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the streets again for his life. Sure, he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">been kicked out of rings. Plenty. In Cali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fornia he was barred for life. But he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good fighter, almost a great fighter. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the past year he had stood as the insur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountable obstacle between all comers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the title. The champion of the champion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">always the challenger but never the champ.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now he was through as a dirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smacked his wine red gloves together</seg><seg type="columnLine">in grim determination, glared at the crowd.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just this one last good clean fight against</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mike Travis tonight; he'd prove he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight clean.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He and Dick had half risen in surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the three thieves 'walked in. One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them had grated: "All right, you guys, up</seg><seg type="columnLine">against that wall and no monkey business.,&gt;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick, old and cautious, had backed against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall, hands raised over his head. Perry</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved slowly, fighting the temper which</seg><seg type="columnLine">choked him. "You'll never get azvay with</seg><seg type="columnLine">this," he'd growled. One of the robbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made a menacing gesture with his gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Travis moved into him, cautiously;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would be cautious.

This guy</seg><seg type="columnLine">would fight dirty given the chance, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirty fighter had no place in the ring. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">should know. He thought of Florence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Promise me," she'd pleaded a couple days</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago, "promise me you'll keep your temper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ring and out." And he'd promised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Travis' left jabs were small charges of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamite exploding in Perry Walsh's face</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he worked in close. But Travis locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his elbows and butted him sharply with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, starting blood flowing from a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut under the eye. The referee didn't see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foul. Perry ignored it and clipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Travis alongside the chin, drawing from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his deep reservoir of hard-earned experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence to shake one hand free, but he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt Travis. The kid went on his bicycle</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, circling to the left and pecking open</seg><seg type="columnLine">that cut beneath Perry's eye. Slowly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut grew and blood flowed more freely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly a left hook swished into Perry's</seg><seg type="columnLine">groin, low. It didn't hurt him or slow him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the referee warned Travis, but Perry</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that wouldn't stop these tactics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A film as red as the blood smeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">across his cheek slowly rose in Perry. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was getting the business. The old crimson</seg><seg type="columnLine">tide of ungovernable anger welled within</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. His eyes narrowed to twin slits. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he suddenly stopped his forward rush as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he remembered Florence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He halted for a moment, shaken, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved into Travis more confidently. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had beaten the thing and could have hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">Travis out of sheer joy after the bell if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">youngster hadn't suddenly sat down. Perry</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized Travis had cleverly worked him</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his own corner just as the bell rang,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he didn't care. He was inwardly glow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing proudly as he strode across the ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lay back. Buzz leaned close to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear: "Better get goin'. This guy's givin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">you the works!" Perry nodded, grinned at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, then smiled and waved at Travis</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the ring. Buzz' mouth fell open in</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishment; a surprised murmur ran</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">6--Fight--Fall</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">through the crowd. Perry chuckled. Flor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence would appreciate that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three thieves had him covered cold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew that. Well, let them have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, which was little enough, he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. Then Dick, in his confusion, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed his hands to drop. One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thugs had half-whirled and crashed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol barrel alongside the old man's head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crumpling kirn to the floor. Then Perry</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew what he had to do, and he was proud</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he did it coldly, and not in anger. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick step had carried him to the nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">man; a hard right knocked him across a</seg><seg type="columnLine">table. Perry spun around toward the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Guns roared. One slug had smashed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his neck. He'd staggered back as another</seg><seg type="columnLine">had blasted into his chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perry kept his eyes on the timekeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was out of his corner with the bell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buzz was yelling at his back for him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore in, to infight. The kid tossed some</seg><seg type="columnLine">rights, hard and sharp. Perry worked over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stomach with both hands before switch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to a clean uppercut. He was feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">good now, and getting stronger. The sweat</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled freely, lubricated his big muscles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Travis took a lesson from what had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened before when he tried to swap</seg><seg type="columnLine">punches and went back to his educated</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hand, unstitching the cut under Perry's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye. Perry grinned at these tactics. Travis</seg><seg type="columnLine">circled, always back and away to his left</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Walsh deliberately stopped in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of the ring and waved him in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Travis merely spat out a foul word</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Perry couldn't identify. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kid moved in swiftly to bounce two knife-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like lefts off the cut again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The youngster was working even faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. Swift, like a collie, in and out. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">round was it ? Eighth round ? Perry wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure. It was a good, hard fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went after Travis, blocking him into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a corner while his eye sopped up a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those snake-like left hands. Blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowed freely now and Travis was trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to out-maneuver him, to stagger him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a right cross and dance free. Perry knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the punch was coming, flexed his knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly to let it slide past his jaw over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left shoulder and then curved a looping</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hook against Travis' ribs. Travis</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunted and scowled, smashed a hard right</seg><seg type="columnLine">82	FIGHT STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">below the belt. It hurt, but Perry only</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned at him. He had that temper situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion well in hand now. The kid finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked out of the trap back into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of the ring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perry had remained standing, his legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread far apart, weaving slightly, a dazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">look in his eyes. From the floor the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandit had propped himself on an elbow</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pump another bullet just below Perry's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. Then the bandits had fled, racing</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the street. Perry had staggered to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open door after them. They were running</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the alley alongside the building. Perry</seg><seg type="columnLine">had follmOed a feiv weak steps, then had</seg><seg type="columnLine">collapsed in the gravel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Travis was there in front of him, always</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabbing, moving away from Perry's right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, his chin hidden behind a raised left</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. He was tough and fast, all right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The blood ran into Perry's eye again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he cocked his head to see. Travis roughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in the clinches and he was proud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ability to curb the instinct to reply with</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar tactics, to refrain from grating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laces across Travis' face, or to clip him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an elbow. Perry ducked his head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bored in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That round was even, maybe a shade on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his side. He was breathing hard, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace was telling on Travis, too. A hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">red lump was raised on one cheek, one eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dark and his ribs would ache. But ev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery wallop still had plenty of sting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Between the rounds, Perry sat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckled at the fight he was making. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">a field day the sportswriters would have.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could see the headlines: "Dirty Fighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gives Technique a Bath!" He chuckled</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buzz worked on the bad eye so he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see and Perry asked himself if he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere find something deep down</seg><seg type="columnLine">within himself this last round to score a</seg><seg type="columnLine">knockout. Wind up his career with a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the bell he rose slowly. Cold, cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culated, untouched by the drug of anger</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had won him previous battles, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepted Travis' straight left jabs with</seg><seg type="columnLine">disdain, crowded beneath the flurry of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiplike blows to rip home a short right,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">another one. And a left. The crowd rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a roar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perry moved into the kid, forced him</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the ring, ripped across his middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">with piston-like precision, switching to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. Travis fought back hard, his breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistling; jabbing, crossing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perry took a faceful of punishment to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get Travis where he couldn't circle, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocked him with a right hook to the jaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dropped his left fist half-way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrist into his body. Travis staggered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly recovered and fought back with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dogged ferocity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both were battling now, their hardest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Travis forgot his jabs as they squared</seg><seg type="columnLine">away in the center of the ring. And, head</seg><seg type="columnLine">burrowed between his thick shoulders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perry answered him with flying fists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dimly, through the great pain, he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear the screaming of an ambulance siren</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Travis folded quickly. Perry ripped a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short left into his solar plexus and left</seg><seg type="columnLine">him gasping. The kid's hands dropped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perry splashed rights and lefts into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, drove him across the ring. A crisp</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hook straightened Travis up and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistling right uppercut dropped him for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a nine count. He struggled to his knees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised one foot under him, then sprawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Perry was exultant as he slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the ropes, bathrobe thrown over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulders, the tumult of the mob roar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in his ears.

Richards</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He never caught the fancy of the fight mob nor the wild acclaim of Press</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Row. A thorough workman, a clean-liver, an uncolorful precisionist with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a wide knowledge of the ring game seldom does. Tony Zale's road to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> middleweight title was long and tough . . . and his record speaks for itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">COLD PALE eyes raked the ringside</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a friendly face. Tony Zale saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">few of them. It was a long way</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Gary to Seattle. Not many steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">workers could make the coast trip but those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who did made up for their lack of numbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">by loud cheering for Tony Zale. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">faith had never wavered. Zale was their</seg><seg type="columnLine">idol. They had been with Tony when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beaten so often in the past that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to quit the ring. Even when he quit</seg><seg type="columnLine">they knew he would come back. Tony was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as tough as Gary's steel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The steel city slugger sat calmly in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner. Typical of Tony. Unworried, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried. And here he was facing the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific left hook artist among the middle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">weights. Zale never could stop a left hook</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his early days and now, six years after</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pro debut, his only defense for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snaking left was hitting the other man</seg><seg type="columnLine">quicker and harder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony grinned at the few familiar faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the blazing ringlights. As long as</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was one Gary steel worker in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house that was enough to spur him on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That, and the terrible anger he felt as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at A1 Hostak. It had taken Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten long, hard years, to fight his way up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the amateurs to a big name bout. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen setbacks had marred his climb to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards the top. But always Tony fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get away from the steel mills. Not that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony felt higher than the work. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just that he knew he was made for some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else. He knew it when he was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">an amateur. He knew it when he climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the ropes for the first time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The prize-ring was a rainbow, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">championship was the pot of gold at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of it. Tony was rugged, he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">sock, he had endless courage. He fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the blond tiger that he was, throwing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his all into every punch. But the ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">had its paradoxes. There were times when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man won and it was just as though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lost. Seven months before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fought this same A1 Hostak in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicago. Tony had come off the deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">to thrash him after being dropped by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whizzing left hook.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Afterwards it was learned that Hostak</seg><seg type="columnLine">had broken his hand after dropping Tony.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They called Zale's victory a fluke. It hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you licked a man and then every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body went around saying you were just</seg><seg type="columnLine">plumb lucky and hadn't really beaten him</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all. Tonight Tony was getting his sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond chance. Perhaps the only chance he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever have to make good again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hostak was the National Boxing Asso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciation Middleweight Champion. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">honor was worth more than half of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disputed world title.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hostak and his manager decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the Zale camp pay if they wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">a return match and a shot at Hostak's</seg><seg type="columnLine">title. Although Hostak had lost seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">months ago, he still retained his title, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">both men had come in over the official</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight. Tony's managers were glum when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they told him Hostak's terms. "You see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that doesn't even leave us enough for</seg><seg type="columnLine">training expenses," Sam Pian said. Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped. "The heck with the expenses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll fight him for nothing. I've just got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have that title, Sam. I know I can beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hostak and you know it." Sam smiled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Okay, Tony, then we'll travel to Seattle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zale faced Hostak beneath the blaze of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights as the referee issued instructions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw the cool confidence, the quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">superiority in Hostak's face and it an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noyed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maybe you don't think I belong in here</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you, Al.

But I don't think so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've come two thousand miles to meet you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hostak, without a cent coming to me. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">man doesn't travel that way for nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fighters shook hands. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">written all over Tony Zale's cold pale eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the grim line of his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I'm going to lick you Hostak, you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">never send me back to Gary in defeat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">never send me back to the steel mills. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">show you that first win was no fluke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE bell. Tense, prayer-like silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">envelopes the crowd. The two hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est hitters among the middle weights crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other beneath the lights. No room</seg><seg type="columnLine">to breathe, barely room to punch. Whack!</seg><seg type="columnLine">whack! they smash at each other and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">echo of scorching leather can be heard in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back rows. Hostak rushes his punches</seg><seg type="columnLine">for one of his famous one round knock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">outs. Zale slams with gusto.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One round melts into another like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring flame. Not even a simple jab is</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown without murderous intentions. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell between rounds is a mere punctuation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mark separating the fighters for a brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute until they tear at each other again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Round four. Sam Pian is happy. "You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead Tony. Stay out in front." Zale nods,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roar of the crowd is in his ears as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hostak rushes him in the fifth. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">champion's pride is badly wounded. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to gamble everything on a knockout</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he does. Left hooks buck from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder in an endless stream. Rights</seg><seg type="columnLine">windmill into Tony Zale's face. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gary fighter stays with the rangy, semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bald Hostak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mid-way in the fifth Tony slams back</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an offensive of his own. He spikes</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hostak's big guns and opens a cut over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the champion's eye. Zale will not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">denied. His jaw aches from the shock of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hostak's lefts. His body is sore from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific infighting. But there's no qu^t in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony Zale, no signs of let up. The Steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">City slugger is a hurricane in the tenth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hostak reels and rolls beneath his shatter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing blows. Hostak has never been on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas, never been knocked out. Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zale grits his teeth. He must drive him</seg><seg type="columnLine">TONY ZALE--HIS RING STORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">87</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to the deck, knock him cold. 11-12- the</seg><seg type="columnLine">13th round, Zale's dynamite-laden fists ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plode on Hostak's granite jaw. The gran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ite is blasted. Hostak takes the count while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowd cheers the thrilling fight with</seg><seg type="columnLine">delight and the handful of Gary steel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">workers go absolutely mad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony Zale is a fighting champion. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">draws the line against nobody. Big Billy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Soose, six feet tall, rangy, long armed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">long legged, a crafty, thinned out light</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavyweight, wants an over-the-weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">match with Zale. Tony might have ducked</seg><seg type="columnLine">it but he took the match. Soose kangaroos</seg><seg type="columnLine">all over Tony and grabs the decision. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">again they start calling Zale a second rater.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even when he's on the top they try and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drag him down. Soose moves into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light-heavyweight division where he be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">longs and leaves Tony looking foolish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The world middleweight championship is</seg><seg type="columnLine">still in a muddle. One half is owned by Tony,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other half is claimed by Ken Overlin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had Mike Jacobs been willing to take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance a few months back things might</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have been different. Shortly before Tony's</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectacular knockout of Hostak, Zale's</seg><seg type="columnLine">manager's had begged Jacobs to give Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shot at Ceferino Garcia, for the New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York version of the title. Mike chose</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ken Overlin instead. Zale had no follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the east, and besides, his past</seg><seg type="columnLine">record was studded with defeats. Tony's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilots, Pian and Winch, talked their</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge's ability up to the skies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jacobs was insistent, "I want Overlin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not Zale." Pian argued that Tony would</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn in a terrific performance against</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garcia as compared to the dull slapper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dapper affair one could expect from Over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin. There was no use arguing with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big promoter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like many of Zale's opponents who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">once dropped Tony to the canvas, A1</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hostak was hard to convince. In their first</seg><seg type="columnLine">encounter he had broken his hand. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">their second clash Al's eyes were cut up</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly. Besides, he had Tony in a bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">way during the fifth round of their Seattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">clash. Chicago was the scene of their third</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Graziano teas furious. His murderous right came screeching at Zale's jaw.</seg><seg type="columnLine">88</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIGHT STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tangle. Tony ripped at Hostak from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening gong. The terrific socking, semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bald Seattle boxer was slugged into obliv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion before the second round ended. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tremendous victory for Tony before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the home town folks. Sam Pian knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that "Benny Ray's fighter" was on top to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The meeting of Sam, Tony and Benny</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ray is a story in itself. It marked a</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning point in Zale's ring career. Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">often felt that afternoon in Trafton's gym</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his rise to the peak possible. Benny</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ray was a local Gary promoter. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an exceptionally shrewd judge of boxers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having predicted the rise of Barney Ross</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Joe Louis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony came smiling into Traf ton's gym</seg><seg type="columnLine">one day. Benny Ray's eyes narrowed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zale had quit the ring in '35, and here it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was two years later, with Tony showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with a boxer's handbag. Zale stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">gingerly toward Ray, his pale blue eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager and alive. "I've been looking for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you Benny." the fighter said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Benny glanced at the handbag, "I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">get it. Last I heard you were back in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel mills."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But not for keeps." Tony smiled, I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">just got to take another crack at fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. I'm ready to hit the comeback trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you'll manage me, Benny."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Gary promoter thought it over.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This Zale kid was made of tough fibre.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had known Tony since way back when.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Gary slugger had been pushed too</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast, over-matched, rushed in against top</seg><seg type="columnLine">notchers without having mastered the rudi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of pro fighting. Benny grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he saw Sam Pian, Barney Ross's</seg><seg type="columnLine">famous manager.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Sam Pian was the answer to Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zale. It would give Benny a chance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">settle a debt that could not be repaid in</seg><seg type="columnLine">money. Many years back Benny Ray was</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on his heels. Sam Pian had staked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him without blinking an eye. Benny would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never forget it as long as he lived. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">promoter glanced at Zale. Given a top</seg><seg type="columnLine">notch manager who could nurse him along</seg><seg type="columnLine">this kid was set for ring stardom. Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pian was that manager.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How about it am?" Benny said, "He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grand kid with a barrel load of guts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Remember, I picked out Ross and Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louis. Well, Tony Zale is going to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">right up there with them some day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zale was thrilled. He hoped Sam Pian</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take him into tow. "Okay, Benny,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've seen this boy in action. I'll bring him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the top for you. Anytime you want him</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, he's yours." For years Pian handled</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Benny Ray's fighter." Benny never asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him back. Each year he predicted</seg><seg type="columnLine">great things for Tony. Pian and Zale</seg><seg type="columnLine">were satisfied and Benny Ray died happily</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time later. He never did see Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise to stardom but he had squared his</seg><seg type="columnLine">debt with Pian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony followed Pian's instructions to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last letter. The desire to make good</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned in Zale like a flame. Zale was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangest tough guy Pian had ever run</seg><seg type="columnLine">across.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He never drank, never swore, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained for each match as though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the last and greatest fight of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">career. When he threw a punch, even a</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple jab, he tossed everything he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind it. He didn't just train, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fanatically devoted to training. Other</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighters might balk at the grind, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony. Other fighters might take it easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">between bouts but Tony went right on</seg><seg type="columnLine">with some part of his training regime.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zale drove himself relentlessly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted as much perfection as he was cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able of. When he finished one bout he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was already thinking of another. Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pian was pleased by his hard driving pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tege. Others were puzzled by this total</seg><seg type="columnLine">devotion to ring warfare. What was Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zale seeking? Did he want to become the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest fighter of all time? What made</seg><seg type="columnLine">him lash back ten times as hard when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chips were stacked against him? What</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him stand up under beatings that</seg><seg type="columnLine">most fighters would have quit?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony Zale was a two fisted tough guy</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the ropes who hated to fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the ring. He was a physical man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who loved to read; a kid who insisted upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtaining a high school education while</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboring in the steel mills. Tony Zale in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own quiet way was an engine. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no answer to Tony Zale's fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive, his tremendous will to succeed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer was in the Tony Zale who faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">TONY ZALE--HIS RING STORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">89</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Hostak, Abrams, Conn and Graziano. Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the answer was there, but the key to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the question. What drove Tony Zale? --</seg><seg type="columnLine">was forged a long time ago when he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a boy in Gary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Anthony florian zaleski,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was born in the fiery reflection of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Gary steel mills. Ever since he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a child he could remember the reddish</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow in the night sky. The soot-covered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke-ridden city, at the lake bottom. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">laborers going to work with green lunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">pails. The mournful cry of the factory</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistles announcing the end of one dreary</seg><seg type="columnLine">shift and the start of another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mills of Gary claimed everyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">sooner or later. Tony's Polish born</seg><seg type="columnLine">parents settled in Gary in 1912. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">father was a moulder in the blazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">foundry of the Illinois Steel Corporation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Automobiles were new fangled, reckless</seg><seg type="columnLine">and expensive things. Joseph Zaleski was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fond of using a bicycle. One day Papa</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zaleski was found dead on the streets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gary, his bicycle a twisted wreck after</seg><seg type="columnLine">having been struck by an automobile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His widow was left with seven children,</seg><seg type="columnLine">five boys and two girls. The road ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a hard one for the family. Mary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eldest daughter, went to work. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">by one the Zaleski boys followed each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other into the roaring infernos of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel mills. As each lad reached fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took up his lunch pail and headed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mills. Young Tony's turn came soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He neither hated nor liked the mills at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first. It was work and the family needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">money. Tony was never one to runaway</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a fact. It was a fact that if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked in the mills and didn't get himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">an education he might not get anywhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">either. His mother encouraged him along</seg><seg type="columnLine">those lines and he graduated from high</seg><seg type="columnLine">school. He was a fine student and read</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great deal along with indulging in sports.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His older brothers, both amateur boxers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">donned the gloves with him when Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only ten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He got used to the feel of padded</seg><seg type="columnLine">leather. It wasn't strange that he entered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Golden Gloves at the age of sixteen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nor was it odd that he won the Gary</seg><seg type="columnLine">welterweight and middleweight titles four</seg><seg type="columnLine">times in a row. Tony rolled up fifty knock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">outs in ninety-five contests. In the winter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 1934 lie travelled to New York in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">to represent Chicago in the inter-city finals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony was a middleweight. He was sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold his own in that division. A big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleepy-eyed colored boy with a shy, pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant smile, was representing Chicago in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light-heavy weight division. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a terrific socker for an amateur, this Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His New York opponent, stocky Melio</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bettina, was far above average for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">amateur likewise. In a few years he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on to win the world's light-heavyweight</seg><seg type="columnLine">championship. At the last minute Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louis was disqualified from the team as</seg><seg type="columnLine">his official residence was Detroit and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicago. Somebody had to fill the Brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bomber's place against a rugged mauler</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Bettina.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony Zale, the middleweight from Sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">urban Gary, was the Windy City's answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Bettina. Tony was tough, dead game.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could hit like a mule and take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">punch without backing up. Of course Zale</seg><seg type="columnLine">only weighed 153 to Bettina's well stacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">175 pounds. But for a kid who managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to graduate from high school and work in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steel mills at the same time, it shouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been too great a handicap, provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">you weren't in Zale's shoes facing husky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Melio Bettina.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Madison Sq. Garden was packed. Bull</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodied, hairy chested Melio Bettina</seg><seg type="columnLine">scowled in his corner. A chunky, unortho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dox southpaw, with tremendous power in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hefty frame, Melio certainly didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">look like an amateur. The mob waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiously for his opponent. They stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">in disbelief as Tonv Zale stepped through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ropes. The blond kid from the mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">west appeared awfully fragile alongside</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bettina. So this was the substitute for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe Louis. Well, chalk up a knockout for</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony could read it in their faces, hear it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their voices when he shed his robe. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood nonchalantly in his corner. Broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldered, square jawed, cucumber cool.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing could ruffle Tony Zale once he</seg><seg type="columnLine">90	FIGHT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped through the ropes. He waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly for the opening bell. Zale rubbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gloves together and rushed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gong's hollow sound. Bettina sailed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. They collided in mid-ring and a sizz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling fight was on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zale was backed against the ropes by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crushing weight advantage of Bettina.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He lashed furiously at his stocky foe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony in trouble was ten times as danger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous, even in these early, simon pure days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bettina sopped up a pulverizing right</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the body. The crowd roared and rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their seats. Melio was grovelling on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canvas. Goliath had been hit by</seg><seg type="columnLine">David's slingshot. The bull-torsoed battler</seg><seg type="columnLine">came off the deck with murder in his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He lunged at the comparatively fragile</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zale. His awkward, southpaw stance threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony off. His tweny-two pound weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge shoved Zale back. Tony never quit</seg><seg type="columnLine">or yielded for a moment. He slugged his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to the final bell while the mob shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">their approval. Bettina got the decision,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zale got the glory. Tony had put up one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gamest, toughest stands, ever dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">played in a handicap fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony had gone as far as he could in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amateurs. His record of fifty knock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out victories was sensational to say the</seg><seg type="columnLine">least. He returned to Gary and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">roundly congratulated by his family and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow steel workers. Tony walked along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grimy streets. He stared at the red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dish glow in the night sky. The mills, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he had seen them since he was a child.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The roaring open hearth furnace ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim him again. The long hours, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreary nights, the mechanical robot march</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men through an inferno. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony Zale hated the mills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His father, his brothers, his relatives</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his pals were all part of the mills.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chained to rivers of molten metals, for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever smelling the warm, rusty odor of hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel in their nostrils. Steel was on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes, bits of metal in their skin. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">washed and scrubbed only to take in more</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel again. Sure, the mills had made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong and tough. The mills had molded</seg><seg type="columnLine">him like an ingot of steel. It was hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, honest work. Tony didn't balk at</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. But there was another door. A door</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fame and fortune to a security he could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">never know in the mills. If he could open</seg><seg type="columnLine">that door Mom would never have to worry</seg><seg type="columnLine">about meeting bills again. The possibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it lay within his fists. The prize-ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">could free him from the mills and give</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mom, the family and himself, a security</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had never known since Father Zaleski</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been killed on the smoke fogged</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets of Gary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Therein lay the answer to what drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony Zale. The kid from Gary fought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay away from the steel mills. He drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself relentlessly in order to make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">better life for himself and others. Sure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony wanted fortune but only enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">buy himself security. Fame? yes, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take that too in his own shy, modest way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As long as he was a hero to his hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">working mother and family, that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough fame for Tony Zale. Mom had</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinned a great many hopes on him. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayed that her boy would make good in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his newly chosen profession. Tony was</seg><seg type="columnLine">courageous, bright, ambitious. He must</seg><seg type="columnLine">make good. He must be happy. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">her son. She had seen too many hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships among the steel workers to deny</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony his gambling attempt at fame and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortune.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHICAGO wasn't like Gary. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">windy city was a huge, indifferent</seg><seg type="columnLine">place for Tony Zale. Fighting for pay</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like beginning his career all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. He had to start from the bottom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Four rounders, prelims that often bored</seg><seg type="columnLine">the customers as they waited for the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">event. But Tony Zale was different right</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the start. He tore from his corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fought with everything he had.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unknowns, Allen, Simpson, Millsap, Lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton. Tony blasted them to the canvas. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">never took a rest, he was anxious to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">good, over-anxious. There were times</seg><seg type="columnLine">when no more than seventy-two hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">elapsed between bouts. Tony would fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a Monday night and be back in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring on Thursday. His competition in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased by leaps and bounds. In five</seg><seg type="columnLine">short months he had punched himself into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main event class. There was no smart</seg><seg type="columnLine">manager to pull strings for him, no "ins"</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a promoter, no organization behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, nothing to back him up but a furious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">TONY ZALE--HIS RING STORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">91</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">courageous desire to make good. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacked experience badly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was no master minding Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blackburn to train and guide him a la</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe Louis. Nor was there a shrewd and</seg><seg type="columnLine">patient manager, devoted, unhurried, tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing endless time to develop him like Pop</seg><seg type="columnLine">Foster had done for Jimmy McLarnin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was nothing but Tony Zale vs. the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other fighters in the ring. His older</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother Johnny, an ex-amateur boxer, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too busy making his own way in the steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">mills. Johnny knew training inside and</seg><seg type="columnLine">out just like he knew his kid brother. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mills had claimed him long ago and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he belonged to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hour glass of Tony Zale's success</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to crack in less than half a year.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Skillful, seasoned main event boxers like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack Gibbons took decisions over him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack, the nephew of two great boxers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yesterday, Mike and Tommy Gibbons, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">his uncles to teach him the subleties of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring craft. Tony was tired, he needed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest. He went right on fighting from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">mis-match to another. He began to slide</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly down to the preliminaries again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Someone by the name of Bazzione took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">decision over him. A guy named Phagan</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked him out. A ham and egger like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack Moran held him to a miserable six</seg><seg type="columnLine">round draw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hour glass of success had broken.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two years after beginning his ring career</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony Zale was back where he started</seg><seg type="columnLine">from. Tony came back to Gary in de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feat. The steelworkers, his family and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mom were still all for him. Gradually Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted toward the dreaded mills. He took</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his place before the open hearth furnace</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and was silent. Tony's ambition was</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted, not crushed. Ted Momot, a friend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked Tony into a Florida trip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the first time in his life the steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">city slugger took a long rest. He basked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sun, fished and loafed. The roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mills and the dim fight crowds were</seg><seg type="columnLine">far behind him. Lying on the sand, staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the tropical blue sky, gave Tony's tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">body a chance to heal and his brain a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to think. He was twenty-three</seg><seg type="columnLine">years old. Vibrant life and hope surged</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into his powerful physique again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He decided to make a comeback. No</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing, no over-matching this time. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't care if it took him ten years. Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zale was determined to master his trade.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He refused to become discouraged despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">any set backs of the past or future. Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew he had the stuff. Melio Bettina was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a top rank pro fighter now and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped Bettina on the deck just two short</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago. Tony Zale returned to Chicago,</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined to turn his back on the steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">mills of Gary forever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Things weren't easy at first, not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Sam Pain at the helm. Tony was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rusty, there was plenty to learn. Becoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">a four round prelim boy again wasn't very</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspiring either. He climbed back very</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. This time fighting several return</seg><seg type="columnLine">matches until he mastered his opponents.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pie had his downs as well as ups. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">again he was kayoed. This time by Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clark. A shadow of a doubt blackened</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony's morale. But he recalled a promise</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would keep him plugging towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">championship even if everything else</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony loved his mother dearly. Despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rugged, tough, self-sufficient fibre he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a momma's boy. Tony helped around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kitchen, washed dishes, mopped floors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even baked cakes. Mom was always there</seg><seg type="columnLine">to encourage him when he was glum. Mom</seg><seg type="columnLine">was there to pray for him when he fought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to worry when he lost and feel hopeful</seg><seg type="columnLine">when her boy won. Tony knew how much</seg><seg type="columnLine">she worried about his career. It wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy for a mother to see her son come</seg><seg type="columnLine">home with nicks and scars and stitches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But if it was what Tony wanted, if there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a rainbow and a pot of gold at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the trail it was alright with her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony promised that he would make good</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a great big way, he would drop the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middleweight championship of the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her lap.

John said that Mom was critically</seg><seg type="columnLine">ill. Tony took a plane to Gary. He arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a few minutes before Mom died. Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">never fought thereafter without thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his mother.

Bald, with a thick mat of hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">curling over his torso. Loose armed, loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">shanked, somewhat flabby around the mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle and yet he was on the trim side. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an odd combination of cleverness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough house tactics.

Coolness, that was Tony's code</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, during and after a fight. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">exciting enough, fighting for the world's</seg><seg type="columnLine">title, returning to the Garden after seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">TONY ZALE--HIS RING STORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">93</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">years of ups and downs. In this very</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring he had slugged it out with Melio</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bettina for an amateur title. And now he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come back as a full fledged profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional. Ring smart, experienced, wised</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, in the art of punching for pay. Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a long way from the steel mills and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was happy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Sam Pian had warned him about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abrams. "Watch that left hook, Tony.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Georgie knows how to throw it with ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geance." Zale's pale eyes narrowed. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter how much he drilled, Tony still</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't found a fool proof defense for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spinning left hook aside from hitting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other man before he got his. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly alright with Tony. A fighter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">job was taking it as well as dishing it</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. The steel city slugger wasn't one</seg><seg type="columnLine">to seek a soft berth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Georgie Abrams awaited the bell with</seg><seg type="columnLine">supreme confidence. It was as simple as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the alphabet. Billy Soose had outboxed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zale. He had trimmed Soose, not once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but three times. Hostak had nearly torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zale's head off with a smashing left hook.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Georgie Abrams had the best left hook in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the business since Hostak. Zale was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing mixer, all the better. There wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sportswriter in the nation who thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wasn't capable of outboxing Zale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abrams snorted at the bell. Zale came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. Characteristic pose. Tow head tipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward. Deep set pale eyes staring, search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. L£ft extended, curled for action. Right</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn up against his chin. Abrams</seg><seg type="columnLine">slammed in. So he wanted to make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight of it from the opening bell. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">double okay with Tony Zale. The steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">city slugger felt his gloves drive hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">against Abrams cross-webbed arms. Geor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gie was a lanky spider with a fatal sting in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In his own way Abrams was as awk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward as Bettina. Leather sizzled against</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh in a hot exchange. Georgie was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tough, smart, a crack infighter. Tony kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushing forward. Biff! bang! Zale felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">his legs buckling. He was on the canvas.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The right side of his face fevered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abrams left hook!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Take it easy Tony. Keep calm, keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool. The grey shirted arm of the referee</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung like a metronome before his pale</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. The mob roar surged at him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">balcony and mezzanine. "One . . . two . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">three . . . four." Zale made no attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to move. "Five . . . six . . . seven." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushed his gloves against satin trunks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Eight!" Zale picked up the count at nine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bounced to his feet. Back in the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner Sam Pian was able to breath again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony waded into Abrams. It was gruel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling, uphill fighting. Georgie had an iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad defense with his cross-webbed arms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each round the steel city slugger increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pace. The bald head loomed before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The long face seemed to mock his</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts. Georgie Abrams wras smarter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster and just as tough as the man from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mills. Zale hammered relentlessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt Abrams grab and hold in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth. Move back in the fifth. Blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">trickled from Georgie's eyes in the sixth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zale was smashing punishing rights at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart and head. It was in the bag, Abrams</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fading mid-way. Bang! that vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">left drove at Tony in the eighth. Zale could</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel his teeth chatter. The crowd faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurred. Abrams swarmed all over him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bell was welcome relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony let himself die for sixty seconds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arms hanging limply, eyes closed. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard nothing, wanted to hear nothing but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blood bubbling through his veins,</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeding his muscles. It was Tony Zale's</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of getting three minutes rest out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixty seconds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony swept Abrams across the ring in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ninth. His drive was too furious for</seg><seg type="columnLine">denial. Georgie was rocked by jolting jabs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaken to his ankles by thunderous rights.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Desperately Abrams worked himself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">and out of clinches. He held for dear</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. Tony slammed him against the ropes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Georgie's instinct, born of long experience</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a cast iron defensive network of arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the only thing that held him up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zale blasted his way to an overwhelming</seg><seg type="columnLine">decision. At the final bell Abrams big</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was a red blood mask. His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammered to a pulp. Nose, cheeks, lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">swollen. Georgie could barely make it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his corner. His arms were bruised and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff, his body beaten into a pink flame.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had paid the price for refusing to yield</seg><seg type="columnLine">before Tony Zale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The new, undisputed middleweight</seg><seg type="columnLine">94</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIGHT STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">champion of the world!" Tony shivered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with joy at the words. An official champ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion at last. On top of the fistic world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven years almost to a day since his</seg><seg type="columnLine">amateur scrap against Bettina in this same</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring. Tony bounded across the ring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Words of praise for his beaten foe. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">microphone was shoved before him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">first words out of his mouth were for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">home folks in Gary. Familiar faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">jammed his dressing room. The steel city</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys would travel twice around the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see Tony fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mike Jacobs clamored for Tony Zale</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. Out of the smoke and din of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressing room Tony heard Billy Conn's</seg><seg type="columnLine">name mentioned. "Billy Conn? Mike</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jacobs wants me to fight Billy Conn?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sure, I'll fight him. Who cares if Conn's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lightheavy or a heayweight? Who cares</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he almost licked Joe Louis. I'll fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe Louis if Mike wants me to." That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Tony Zale, not boasting, just willing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to trade leather with any man in the ring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sam Pian signed for the Conn match</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately. The sports writers thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was crazy. If believing implicity in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ability of Tony Zale to stand up against</seg><seg type="columnLine">any man in the ring was insanity, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam Pian was crazy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TONY ZALE didn't linger in New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York very long. He never felt at</seg><seg type="columnLine">home outside of Gary. Gary people were</seg><seg type="columnLine">his people. The kind he had grown up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with and knew best. Tony shook hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the steel city until his fingers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sore. He visited his old haunts, places</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had never gotten away from. Places</seg><seg type="columnLine">he never wanted to get away from. St.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hedwig's Catholic Grammar School in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gary. Father Grothouse, the priest who</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew him ever since he was a kid. Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gilroy, physical director for Gary schools.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fellows he had played handball and</seg><seg type="columnLine">baseball with, the steel workers, the name-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, numerous chums around the city who</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more felt at home in Gary without</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing Tony Zale, then he did when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was away from them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, 1941 was a great year for Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zale. It was at this time that he met a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very striking brunette. It was the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">St. Hedwig's party he had ever attended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adeline Richwalski's presence had seen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. She was a sweet girl, a wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl. She would make a good wife for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony Zale now that he could settle down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He kept running into her by accident, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gary, in Chicago. On the street, in a bus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a train, at a social gathering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After his fight with Billy Conn, Zale</seg><seg type="columnLine">enlisted in the Navy. Two days later he</seg><seg type="columnLine">married Adeline. Nobody was surprised.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adeline became part of the large Zaleski</seg><seg type="columnLine">family with their happy gatherings. Things</seg><seg type="columnLine">were settling for Tony Zale. The steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">city slugger couldn't forsee the future.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had no idea what would happen against</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conn, except that he would fight like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiger. He had no idea how long the war</seg><seg type="columnLine">would last and like everyone else he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never heard of Rocky Graziano.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> February 13, 1942, the war is in full</seg><seg type="columnLine">swing. Uniforms can be spotted all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Garden. The crowd has turned out</seg><seg type="columnLine">for one of the biggest handicap matches</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever staged. Billy Conn, hard hitting Pitts-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burgh heavyweight who eight short months</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago flattened Joe Louis, is facing the 160</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounder, Tony Zale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It doesn't make sense, Zale has no busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness being in there with Conn. Joe Louis</seg><seg type="columnLine">is introduced in uniform. He smiles</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadly at his rousing reception. He shakes</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands with Conn, then Zale. There is</seg><seg type="columnLine">admiration in the Brown Bomber's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he speaks with Tony Zale. Both of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them came up from the Chicago amateurs</seg><seg type="columnLine">together. Zale went to bat for him against</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bettina the night Joe was disqualified.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conn nearly took Joe's title. People are</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking, Louis isn't what he was cracked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to be. Who is Conn? Can a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">guy like Tony Zale lick him?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe sits tensely in his ringside seat. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">outcome of Conn vs. Zale is darned im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant for the Brown Bomber. If Zale</seg><seg type="columnLine">upsets Billy Conn then the public is right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe Louis has lost his grip, and a million</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollar future gate will be swept away. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">odds are heavy on Conn but Joe remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers Tony Zale from those amateur days.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The steel city slugger's gameness is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">factor to be reckoned with.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Conn. six feet tall, towers over five feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight inch Tony Zale. The Pittsburgh</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighter has everything but stamina and</seg><seg type="columnLine">TONY ZALE--HIS RING STORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">courage over Tony Zale. Its apparent from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the start, Conn's superiority. Billy is fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shifty, he had reach, height, weight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conn moves rapidly on the balls of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, blocks beautifully with his elbows</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shoulders. Zale, blond, pale eyed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pugnacious, rips at the bigger man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zale takes the third with a furious drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the body. Four more rounds pass with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conn in front. They're coming out for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eighth. Six rounds for Billy, only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Tony. The steel city slugger shakes</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conn with a smashing mid-section attack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe Louis stirs uncomfortably, not that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he doesn't wish Tony Zale the best of</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck. But if the shorter, smaller man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the complete underdog turns the tide, Joe's</seg><seg type="columnLine">performance against Billy Conn will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">written off the books as a failure for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown Bomber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Conn is aware of the excited drone of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowd. Zale is making him look foolish</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed. The Pittsburgh heavyweight is</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly determined to end this farce in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ninth. If he can knock out a two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">pound heavyweight like Gunnar Barlund,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop Joe Louis on his panties, surely he</seg><seg type="columnLine">can better this middleweight into sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zale reels beneath the fury of Conn's</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack. Don't go down, Tony. Don't go</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, Tony. He keeps repeating between</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked lips. He tried gamely to fight back</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Conn drives him from one side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring to the other. Its the bell, the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ninth. Zale is still on his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Conn continues banging away, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tenth, eleventh. Tony answers Conn's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fury the only way he knows how. with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">merciless barrage of his own, a faltering but</seg><seg type="columnLine">plucky counter-attack against the bigger</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Before the finish of the fight in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelfth, Zale had been on the verge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a knockout five times as he staggered on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canvas.

If Zale was made of</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel, Rocky was hewn from the concrete</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidewalks of New York.

The street was where</seg><seg type="columnLine">young Rocky learned, the street was where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he lived. Graziano believed in only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">law, that which his ten knuckles could</seg><seg type="columnLine">either defend or break.

The guy who is going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight Graziano. Say, Zale's the champ</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't he? These conversations were typi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal wherever sportsmen gathered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony trained doggedly, unmindful of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the huge buildup for his opponent. Graz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iano was just another fighter to him. Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">was aware of Graziano's crashing right</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not afraid of it. The fight was sched-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uled for July but destined not to come of?</seg><seg type="columnLine">until September. Zale complained of pierc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing pains in his ribs. Trainer and mana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers rushed him to a doctor.

His arms are beginning to feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">weary from the hundreds of punches he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed at the champion.

Just three</seg><seg type="columnLine">short minutes later the dean of sports-</seg><seg type="columnLine">writers reverses his opinion as Graziano</seg><seg type="columnLine">turns the tide again in the fifth. See-saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">betting around the ringside makes the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">look like a panic on the stock exchange.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One moment someone holding a fist full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">greenbacks is shouting himself hoarse for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zale only to place his money on Graziano</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second later.

His fourth round rally is just</seg><seg type="columnLine">a memory. He wobbles without being hit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he staggers from the breeze of Graziano's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild swings.

Despite his beaten condition</seg><seg type="columnLine">a coldly frozen look of determination is</seg><seg type="columnLine">riveted in Zale's eyes. Tony isn't through</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sam Pian can see that. Maybe he can</seg><seg type="columnLine">take one more solid punch, or two, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">three. Maybe he'll just go out there and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hang on to Graziano until the referee stops</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fight. But go out there he must. Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows his fighter, Tony isn't licked until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they've counted ten over him. Sam knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">it doesn't make sense but not even Graz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iano can shatter his faith in Tony Zale. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bell he keeps telling the others that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony will win. "You'll see, you'll see, he'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">win." Sam repeats blindly. Nothing can</seg><seg type="columnLine">diminish his faith in Tony Zale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The champion has barely moved from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his corner when Graziano is in on him</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Zale is a pitiful spectacle, wobbly</seg><seg type="columnLine">legged, punching back feebly with nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but instinct and heart to back him up.

The excitement in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressing room reached everyone but Tony.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The titleholder lay stretched on a rubbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">table. His swollen right hand soaking in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bucket of ice water. His eyes closed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face nicked with cuts. The doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">kneeled over him and carefully cleaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mouth wounds. The mob had almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">torn him apart as the police fought their</seg><seg type="columnLine">way back to his dressing room. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space of an hour Tony Zale had risen</seg><seg type="columnLine">from an unpublicized champion to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">status of hero, his name spoken of as often</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Graziano's now. No longer would they</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask who the middleweight champion was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">True, Tony had taken a worse beating</seg><seg type="columnLine">than Graziano, but he had delivered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">payoff punch and won. Tony could re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to Gary now with a heart full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride while his wounds healed. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a long winter of rest ahead of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">champion before he faced Rocky Graziano</seg><seg type="columnLine">again in the spring. The Zaleski family,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adeline his wife, and his two cute daugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters, Mary and Terry, would always be</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his side. The champion would forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his brutal struggle with Graziano,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stitches in his mouth, the ache in hi9</seg><seg type="columnLine">swollen right hand, until the spring, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would have to remember Rocky Graz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iano again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Rocicy graziano, the bad boy of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">boxing, bounced back into the head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines again shortly before his re-match with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony Zale. Big black ugly headlines that</seg><seg type="columnLine">half told the story of a bribe. The Rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">had withdrawn from a scheduled Garden</seg><seg type="columnLine">clash with Cowboy Reuben Shank. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">commission approved of his withdrawal</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the time and let it go at that. A month</seg><seg type="columnLine">later the headlines screamed from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stands:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GRAND JURY PROBES GRAZIANO</seg><seg type="columnLine">BRIBE OFFER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Confused, almost completely bewildered</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the courtroom proceedings, Graziano</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat between his manager and lawyer while</seg><seg type="columnLine">his case was reviewed. He was placed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the witness stand and admitted a bribe</seg><seg type="columnLine">offer to lay down for Shank had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposed in the dressing room of a gym</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time back. Graziano said he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know who the man was and certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't take the bribe for the fight that</seg><seg type="columnLine">never came off. Previously Rocky had</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurted quite honestly that he might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepted a bribe in his earlier fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">days had one been offered him. He said</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was broke when he started out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably would have engaged in a fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight had he been approached with enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dark light of suspicion was cast on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rocky. His brutally frank testimony didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">help him any. In a cleanup drive by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxing commission Graziano was selected</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a number one example. His dishonor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able discharge record from the Army was</seg><seg type="columnLine">given wide play.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although Rocky Graziano had never en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaged in a phony fight in his career never</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken a bribe, and didn't know who the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thugs were who had propositioned him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was banned for life by the New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">Commission and its affiliates. The charges</seg><seg type="columnLine">leveled against him were failure to report</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bribe at the time it happened and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor Army record which was considered</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bad example for youthful followers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The proposed March 21st, clash with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zale was driven out of the Garden and</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York State. The Twentieth Century</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sporting Club sought frantically for a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">site. Many states joined New York's out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawing of Graziano and for awhile it</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked as though the re-match of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">decade might never come off. Chicago</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally approved of the match and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Windy City was an ideal spot.

Graziano's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad publicity had only served to increase</seg><seg type="columnLine">the public's curiosity over the second bid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lawless caveman from the sidewalks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of New York.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The champion stepped into the familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicago ring. He was instantly aware of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrific heat from the new, suped up</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighting system. The ring was like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">oven, over one hundred degrees beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">those blazing lights. Tony Zale sat quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and confidently in his corner. Pian spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">briefly of their ring strategy. Rush him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, head, don't give Graziano a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to open up and watch that right. Zale</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded. He winked at a friend along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringside, mopped the perspiration from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brow, and stepped gingerly across the ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the bell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony's cold pale eyes concentrated on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark, savage leer that twisted Graz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iano's face. The challenger was dying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get at him. But he had gathered some</seg><seg type="columnLine">respect for Zale's hitting power since their</seg><seg type="columnLine">first clash. Tony hammered at his enemy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">weaving body. Sharp, short, jolting</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashes that made Graziano gasp. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">champion rolled expertly beneath the crude</seg><seg type="columnLine">slugger's attempts to bash his blond head</seg><seg type="columnLine">in with a single crack of his right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zale had the situation under control.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Rock constantly missed fire and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beaten off each time he tore at Tony.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zale was certainly a master boxer tonight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He switched to the head with ease and cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rocky over the left eye with needling</seg><seg type="columnLine">rights. Tony drilled rights at the eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the blood flowed freely.

Once more he plugged at Zale, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage leer still on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crowd was hypnotized by the grim,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gory struggle. The sweating backs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fighters glistened beneath the blazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights. Desperate, rib aching punches echoed</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the ringside. No matter who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge, the mob knew either one could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit the deck at any moment. Zale flung a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lot of weight behind a wicked, curling</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. Graziano buckled and struck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas. The fans were delirious with ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citement, the thunder had burst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rocky swept up from the floor at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">count of one. A strange, nasty gleam</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouded his wild dark eyes. He grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Tony Zale with contempt. Is that all</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can do chump ? The words were</seg><seg type="columnLine">written on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Tony Zale all the way now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hooking lefts to the head and body, bear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his curling right hand down on Graz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iano's battered eyes. The champion's torso</seg><seg type="columnLine">was drenched with sweat beneath the burn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing blaze of lights. The heat was well</seg><seg type="columnLine">over one hundred degrees in the smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">choked arena. Graziano, nine years</seg><seg type="columnLine">younger than the thirty-three year old</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel city slugger seemed little affected by</seg><seg type="columnLine">it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the bell ended the fifth Zale walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly and confidently towards his corner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He lay back against the ropes and breathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily. He had been forcing the fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the pace was beginning to tell. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">never for a moment did he doubt his ability</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep pushing the match. His cold pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were calm with assurance. The steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">workers shouted at him to keep up the good</seg><seg type="columnLine">work from various parts of the hot arena.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zale grinned inwardly. The bets of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mikes, Joes, Tonys, Steves and Als, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open hearth furnaces were safe. Gary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indiana could pull in the sidewalks to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night and celebrate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graziano sneered at Tony as they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out for the sixth. A smoldering, savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam in his bruised eyes. Sam Pian</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded with approval as Tony pumped a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady stream of lefts at his opponent's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. Once again Zale felt Graziano's raw</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength in close and realized the chal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenger was far from beaten. The champion</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">trained his fire on the battered eyes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his enemy. The tough, chunky muscled</seg><seg type="columnLine">challenger rammed back with vicious lefts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zale felt a right crash against his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sudden fury. Graziano's thumping</seg><seg type="columnLine">punches splattered him against the ropes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graziano was all over him, ripping leather</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the air like a madman. Zale's head</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounced back like a rubber ball from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fierce jolt of Graziano's rights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The champion's legs began to give.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wherever he turned Garziano was there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pouring a roaring Niagara of leather in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face. Tony began to lose consciousness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His arms dangled loosely, he wobbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the ropes, refusing to go down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He barely heard the roar of the crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Graziano drove him against the ropes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The blazing lights whirled before his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The canvas rocked beneath his feet. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mid-rope dug into his waist as he bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">double over it. Graziano slashed at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the referee removed the fury of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">former Dead End Kid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pian and Winch led Tony back to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner. The beaten champion shook his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and mumbled something about con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinuing the fight. Rocky Graziano, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conqueror, was paraded around the ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his right hand help up. The crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared their approval and the beaten Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zale was cheered as he passed along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aisle. It was hard for Tony to accept de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feat. Almost impossible for him to be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve that Graziano had licked him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">complained of the sweltering heat, of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">referee's hastiness in stopping the match.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The scribes shrugged their shoulders at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony's alibi. Graziano had broken him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his thunder. The champion was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty-three, he was old, decrepit, tough</seg><seg type="columnLine">yes, game to the core, but unable to stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the youthful fury of Graziano. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a great match, another thrilling</seg><seg type="columnLine">contest if he was thrown in with Graziano</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, but inevitable that Tony Zale had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed his peak and Graziano was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">master.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE defeated champion returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gary. The steel workers, his family</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his pals, ever loyal, welcomed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmly. He was still their Tony, the kid</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the mills who had made good. Maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">TONY ZALE--HIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the rest of the country didn't believe Zale</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could lick Graziano in a pay-off match but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Gary was behind him, perhaps more out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of loyalty than knowledge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Tony didn't have to fight Graziano</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">again. At last he had made enough money</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to retire on, the steels mills were safely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">behind him. He could buy a house in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Gary for his wife and children and live</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">peacefully without ever having to go</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through the grind of gruelling ring war-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fare again. He was thirty-four now, old</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for a fighter. Including his amateur days</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tony had been pushing leather for nearly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eighteen years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He had beaten several champions, stood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up to Billy Conn and knocked out Rocky</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Graziano. For six years he had been the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">undisputed middleweight champion of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">world. Add this to years of active service</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the Navy and you have a fighter who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">can retire on his laurels. Nobody would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have called Tony Zale a quitter if he hadn't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">faced Graziano for a third time. That is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nobody except Tony Zale himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The steel city slugger not only thought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he could trim Graziano, he was positive of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it. Sam Pian and Art Winch were al-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ways there to back his confidence. Some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">quarters criticized Pian and Winch for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">signing for a third bout. Anybody could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">see that Tony was an aging fighter. His</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nose was spread in the center, the flesh</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">above his eyes permanently hammered into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">twin swellings. His ears were thickening,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the boyish look had long since vanished</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from his face. Tony Zale had the marked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">features of a veteran who had been to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wars often and long.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When Pian and Winch signed for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rubber match with Graziano they remem-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bered what a lot of people had forgotten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A younger, cruder hitting Tony Zale, quite</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ferocious beneath the deceptive calm of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">those cold, pale eyes.

"He's a great kid," Benny had said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Even if he gets licked you can be sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'll lick the pants off his opponent in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">return go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pian remembered that trip to Youngs-</seg><seg type="columnLine">town, Ohio with Tony. The Zale kid had</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up a lot since they had taken him</seg><seg type="columnLine">over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had learned to put punches to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether in combinations and dropped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right hand crazy stance. Youngstown and</seg><seg type="columnLine">A1 Wardlow were to be the acid test for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony. Wardlow was a good boxer, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">puncher and a southpaw to boot. Pian said</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to Tony, "Just go in there and see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you can do." The kid from Gary did</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty. He knocked out Wardlow in three</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounds. Pian and Winch were sold for</seg><seg type="columnLine">life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The series with Hostak clinched every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. Tony coming off the canvas to</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze through by a close decision the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Flattening Hostak in 13 rounds the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second time out. Kayoing him in 2 rounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">during their third clash. Tony Zale always</seg><seg type="columnLine">improved in a series and Graziano was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no exception, Pian and Winch were sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that. Besides, Tony carried a memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Graziano's savage, boastful leer around</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him. He hadn't forgotten the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt in the wild dark eyes either. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then there was all of Gary, one hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty thousand strong, praying that their</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy from the steel mills would regain his</seg><seg type="columnLine">title.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They showed up in Ruppert Stadium,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jersey City, on the cool June night mark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the third and final clash of the middle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight feudists.

If Pian and Winch ever wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get back at Uncle Mike for snubbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony in the past this was the night to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rocky Graziano bounces through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ropes. A cocky sneer on his face. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">glares at Zale. Rocky is the champion now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he lets Tony know it. Pian, Winch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ray Arcel and Tony Zale huddle beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lights as the referee speaks. Graziano</seg><seg type="columnLine">slices the air with anxious gloves. Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zale tenses in his corner. This is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowning fight of his career and he knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. He drinks deeply of the cool night</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. No blazing heat to sap his strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He bites hard on his mouthpiece and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinds his toes into the resin.

He hammers his gloves</seg><seg type="columnLine">together and waits anxiously for the bell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The warning buzzer. Zale is on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. Graziano, cocksure, supremely con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fident, turns his back on the Gary Slugger</seg><seg type="columnLine">and waves his glove at a friend. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">gong.

One minute of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fight gone and he's taking the count.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sneer comes slowly back again.

Nei-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther fighters nor referee are aware that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the round had ended.

Tony beats off one at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack, counter-punches another, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fury of Graziano's revenge cannot be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nied. The steel city slugger's legs wobble</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the shattering, unending wave of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloves. Grimly, defiantly, Tony sticks with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.

Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zale is out to win or die.

It javelins</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Graziano's face and shoves him off</seg><seg type="columnLine">balance. Once again, with the amazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">precision of a Tunney, Tony follows quick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly with a bitterly sharp left hook. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of blow that stuns and cuts and makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">you feel that your opponent is wielding a</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony bucks his shoulders behind some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the most vicious punches ever tossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a fighter. Each one is calculated to end</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fight, each one carried enough lead to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sink a ship. Rocky Graziano is no ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary mauler. He's hurt, very badly hurt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the rugged veteran of a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">street brawls cannot be brought down so</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zale switches to the body. The crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">spills into the aisles. The partisans of</seg><seg type="columnLine">both fighters shout frantic advice at them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graziano is dazed, he goes through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motions of fighting. Instinctively he seeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ropes for protection. He can hang on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ropes, he can recover on the ropes he</seg><seg type="columnLine">can come back from the ropes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only Tony Zale won't let him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gary slugger tosses everything into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">double barreled drive at the head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. Rocky is broken by the drive and</seg><seg type="columnLine">collapses on the canvas. One leg rises dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jointedly in the air. One arm is crushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath his torso. His eyes half closed, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth wide open, he takes the count.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Five-six-seven. Rocky is up on his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">again!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TONY pounces at the stricken cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pion.

He rockets half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen beautifully timed punches at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">champion. The mob howls as Graziano's</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs spread wide. His knees jerk and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounces on the canvas. His arms curl</seg><seg type="columnLine">around his head, the wild dark eyes are</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazed and silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zale moves to a neutral corner. His face</seg><seg type="columnLine">impassive, his eyes coldly regarding his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen enemy. The referee sweeps his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the prostrate figure of Graziano with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a mournful cry of--ten and out! Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zale has succeeded in doing what only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great Stanley Ketchell has ever accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plished. The winning of the middleweight</seg><seg type="columnLine">championship from the same fighter he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost it to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zale is mobbed as he leaves the ring. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad grin creases his face. But there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">no gloating in the cold pale eyes as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">glances back at Graziano. The former</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead end kid is a real fighter to the core</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Tony has respect for a guy like him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self who came up the hard way. The Rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">shakes his head bitterly as he passes along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aisle and Tony knows just how he feels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The steelworkers pour all their winning</seg><seg type="columnLine">bets into a basket.

Still, it was a risky fight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cerdan was faster, hard to figure, he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">make trouble. Tony had just completed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gruelling series with Graziano.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, I'll fight him." Tony said, "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">the champ. I've got to defend iny title."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He figured a champion like himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't have too many fights left in him</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the age of thirty-four. The sooner he</seg><seg type="columnLine">took on this new challenger, the better.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winch and Pian got Tony $120,000 for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the match. Just in case Tony lost he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be well paid for the effort. Not that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected him to lose. Zale was a better</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringman than Cerdan, he liad proved him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self against Graziano. While proving him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self he had burnt a lot of energy, taken a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lot of punches, and he was thirty-four with</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighteen long years of glove slinging be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In September, 1948, Tony was back in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ruppert Stadium again. The same ring in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had humbled Graziano just a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few months before. Paul Cavalier, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same referee. Cerdan even looked like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graziano a bit. But the resemblance ended</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. The Frenchman was a far cleverer</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxer and certainly as rugged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was a cold night and Sam Pian</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped a towel around Tony's blond</seg><seg type="columnLine">head to keep him warm. The French boxer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his managers had difficulty under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing the referee's instructions. Cava-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lier crossed his hand impatiently along</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cerdan's waist to indicate the foul line.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neither fighter glanced at the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony shadow boxed in his corner. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the champion, the favorite. He ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered to be in magnificent shape although</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face showed clearly the battlemarks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ring. The hammered flesh above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, stitches webbed through his blond</seg><seg type="columnLine">brows, scars around his mouth, both ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickened. Tony certainly looked like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aging, tough fighter that he was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cerdan moved deftly at the bell, gloves</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to each other. His body was heavy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">set, brutally powerful, and yet he moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the speed of a thin, fast, terribly fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxer. In a sense there was something un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural about all that bulk moving with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lithe and grace of a sleek animal.

He was fighting the Frenchman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a spectator watching him. Cerdan let</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony do all the leading, most of the fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the early rounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every so often the Frenchman would</seg><seg type="columnLine">break into a flurry of fast, hitting, vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">counter punching, curling his right, strik-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his left with deft, deadly fury. Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinked his eyes and covered up. As the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight progresed he continued covering up</seg><seg type="columnLine">more and more. He still sought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchman with a jab, a hook, sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would risk a swinging right. But Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cel Cerdan was incredibly fast and clever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He let Tony push the fight. He laid back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and countered without wasting a motion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His sense of pace was constant. Cerdan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner had plotted a brilliant strategy. Zale</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be made to -force things. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been several years since the champion had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone more than six rounds. Zale would</seg><seg type="columnLine">punch himself out while Marcel waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The strategy of the Frenchman was</seg><seg type="columnLine">precisely the opposite of Graziano's. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocked patiently, led Tony into false leads,</seg><seg type="columnLine">countered with sparkling skill and landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">several lefts to the head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TONY began breathing heavily. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast, shifting pace was beginning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell after a few rounds. The blond, bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered champion wore a worried frown.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marcel Cerdan was damned elusive. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloves were glued beneath his chin, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">never led, never indicated any move he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might make. If it hadn't been for Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zale there might not have been any fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak of. It was Tony who forced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">openings, pushed the action, sought at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first with confidence, now with desperation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clean shot at Cerdan's jaw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sixth, seventh, eighth. The fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore on, the champion stalked and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouted with short, heavy, breath-taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">punches. Zale gasped and hitched up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">trunks. He lunged several times and</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed. Always Cerdan caught him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">shattering left hooks when he missed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchman punched with frightening</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed. Not that Tony was afraid, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was just no way to get at this man</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fatigue was stabbing at his legs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the bout pushed into the ninth and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tenth rounds Tony was too tired to try</seg><seg type="columnLine">a savage rally as he had done against</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graziano. Besides, Cerdan was remark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably crafty. He blocked skillfully with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms and shoulders while his poised gloves</seg><seg type="columnLine">were ready to strike at a split seconds</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice. Tony was very tired as the bell</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded for the eleventh. The left hooks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hooks he never really learned to stop,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were piling up against his face and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes tear and his ears ring. Cerdan</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a hard puncher, not a one punch hitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Graziano, but a man who kept adding</seg><seg type="columnLine">one blow to another until his opponent was</seg><seg type="columnLine">subtracted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony's head ached. He had been stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered several times. The breath was</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked out of him from rattling, snaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">blows to the pit of his stomach. His legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged over the canvas and his arms were</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaden. Then Cerdan opened up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything he had. The cagey Frenchman</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped depth bombs on Tony's jaw in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the form of snapping left hooks and club-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing rights that stunned the senses. Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">wavered near the ropes, then all the lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out in his brain and he was pitched</seg><seg type="columnLine">into darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smelling salts, ice packs, and the champ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion came around again only to learn that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was an ex-champion. Tony had col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapsed at the bell from sheer exhaustion</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the compilation of Marcel Cerdan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady pounding. The crowd gave the steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">city slugger a rousing hand for his game</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand. Tony took the loss of his champion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship philosophically. He was thirty-four,</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle scarred, with eighteen years of ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">warfare behind him. The Graziano fights</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen him at his peak, the Cerdan loss</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen him sliding down that peak. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">man couldn't stay on top forever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Win or lose, his old pals mobbed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he returned to Gary. As Tony gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the reddish glow of the night sky he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew he had won his greatest fight. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle to stay out of the steel mills. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight to make a better life for himself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who would come after him. He lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened to the mournful cry of the factory</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistles and he saw the steel laborers</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to work with their green lunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">pails. The end of one dreary shift, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning of another. Nothing had</seg><seg type="columnLine">TONY ZALE--HIS RING STORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">111</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">changed in Gary since he was a kid and</seg><seg type="columnLine">first saw the reddish glow in the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. Nothing had changed except Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zale who had gone far beyond Gary to</seg><seg type="columnLine">win fame and fortune in the prize-ring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony, acting on the advice of his man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ager, his friends, and many sports writers</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout the country, decided to hang up</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gloves for good the early part of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">year.
