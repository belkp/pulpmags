There was a smouldering hatred in</seg><seg type="columnLine">those eyes, and something else . . . envy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, or was it jealousy? Dennis</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't tell. But his senses became in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly alert.

Ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorbed in trying to puzzle the sudden en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mity of this Martian stranger, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unaware of the Mercurian Dancer. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter had edged closer, whirling in pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic flashes from the myriad semi-pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious stones that studded her brief gauze</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirt. And now, in a final bid for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spacer's favor she flung herself in his lap</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tilted back invitingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Some of the guests laughed, others stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">in plain envy at the handsome, red-haired</seg><seg type="columnLine">spacer, but from the table across, came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinkling sound of a fragile glass being</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed in a powerful hand, and a muffled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian curse. Without warning, the Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tian was on his feet with the speed of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hellacorium, the table went crashing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side as he leaped with deadly intent on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sprawled figure of Dennis Brooke. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">high-pitched scream brought instant silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a Terran girl cried out.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dennis was not there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LEAPING to one side, impervious to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fall of the dancer, he avoided the</seg><seg type="columnLine">murderous rush of the Martian youth, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wheeled swiftly and planted a sledge-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammer blow in that most vulnerable spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all Martians, the spot just below their</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow, wasp-like waist, and as the Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tian half-doubled over, he leftcd him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short jab to the chin that staggered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all but dropped him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Martian's violet eyes were black</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fury now.

Dennis took it, flat-footed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without flinching; then he let his right ride</seg><seg type="columnLine">over with all the force at his command. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the Martian on the jaw and spun</seg><seg type="columnLine">him like a top, the pale, imperious face</seg><seg type="columnLine">went crimson as he slowly sagged to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees and rolled to the impeccable mosaics</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dennis, breathing heavily, stood over</seg><seg type="columnLine">him until the international police arrived,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then he had the surprise of his life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Upon search, the police found a tiny, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatal silvery tube holstered under his left</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm-pit -- an atomic-disintegrator, forbid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SOUL EATERS	5</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">den throughout the interplanetary League.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only major criminals and space pirates</seg><seg type="columnLine">still without the law were known to possess</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looks like your brawl has turned out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a piece of fool's luck, Brooke!"

Pity we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">no complete records on that devil's crew!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anyway, we'll radio the I.S.P., perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have details on this dandy!"

He laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly as he became conscious of the ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">omous stare of the Mercurian Dancer, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the excited voices of the guests and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">emphatic disapproval of the Veriusian pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prietor who was shocked at having a brawl</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his ultra-expensive, ultra-exclusive Pal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better come to Headquarters with me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dennis," the lieutenant said gently.

He eyed the six foot four</seg><seg type="columnLine">frame of the Captain before him with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixture of feelings, as if uncertain how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin. Finally, he sighed as if, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to a decision, he were forcing himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sit down, Dennis.

Even their cruiser was a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience, the long, tapering fighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacked the luxurious offices and appoint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of the regular I.S.P. Patrol spacers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It placed a maximum on speed, and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">available space was hoarded for fuel. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning fast tiger of the space-lanes, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thing of beauty, but of grim, sleek beauty</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinct with power, not the comfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">luxury that they knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Day after day they went through their</seg><seg type="columnLine">drills, donning space suits, manning battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">stations; aiming deadly atom-cannon at</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty space, and eternally scanning the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast empty readies by means of the telecast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And suddenly, out of the void, as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had all but given up the search as a wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">goose chase, a speck was limned in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted surface of the viso-screen in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">control room. Instantly the I.S.P. cruiser</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to life. In a burst of magnificent</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, the cruiser literally devoured the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space leagues, until the spacer became a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashing streak. On the viso-screen, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speck grew larger, took on contours, grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and becoming slowly the drifting shell</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what had been a transport.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Presently they were within reaching dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance, and Captain Brooke commanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the teleradio from the control</seg><seg type="columnLine">room:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Prepare to board!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SOUL EATERS	7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every member of the crew wanted to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the boarding party, for all but</seg><seg type="columnLine">George Randall, the junior member of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew had served his apprenticeship among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inner planets, Mars, Venus and Terra.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He felt nauseated at the very thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">going out there in that vast abyss of space.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His young, beardless face, with the candid</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue eyes went pale when the order was</seg><seg type="columnLine">given.

He tried to main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain a calm exterior, but inwardly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seethed in a cold fury more deadly than</seg><seg type="columnLine">any he had ever experienced. Somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had expected to find at least one com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partment unharmed, where life might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">endured, but now, all hope was gone. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great resolve to deal with Koerber once</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for all remained to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dennis tried not to think of Marla, too</seg><seg type="columnLine">great an ache was involved in thinking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and all he had lost.

But they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">spacemen, implicit in their loyalty, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dennis Brooke they could and did feel safe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom Jeffery, the tall, angular and red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced Navigator, whose slow, easygoing</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements belied the feral persistence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tiger, and the swiftness of a striking</seg><seg type="columnLine">cobra in a fight, led the small procession</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men toward the emergency planes. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind him came Dallas Bernan, third lieu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenant, looming like a young asteroid in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">space suit, followed by Scotty, and finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Brooke himself. All left in si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence, as if the tragedy that had occurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard the wrecked liner, had touched them</seg><seg type="columnLine">intimately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ABOARD the I.S.P.

His own heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hammering, and inwardly he prayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it were Koerber. It had to be! No</seg><seg type="columnLine">interplanetary passenger spacer could pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibly be out here at the intersection of an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gles Kp 39 degrees, 12 minutes, Fp 67 de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grees of Ceres elliptic plane.

The "Jet Analyzer" recorded</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful disturbance, atomic--could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly Captain Brooke was at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inter-communication speaker:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Crew, battle stations! Engine room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">full speed!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scotty Byrnes was already dashing to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine room, where his beloved motors</seg><seg type="columnLine">purred with an ascending hum. Aboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the I.S.P. Cruiser each member of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">crew raced to his assigned task without</seg><seg type="columnLine">delay. Action impended, and after days</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nights of inertia, it was a blessed re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lief. Smiles appeared on haggard faces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the banter of men suddenly galvan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized by a powerful incentive was bandied</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and forth. All but George Randall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now that action was imminent. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing gripped his throat until he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly stand the tight collar of his I.S'.P.</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniform. A growing nausea gripped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowels, and although he strove to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm, his hands trembled beyond control.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the compact, super-armored control</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, Captain Brooke watched the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast's viso-screen, with hungry eyes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were golden with anticipation. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him as if an eternity passed before at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last, a black speck danced on the illuminated</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen, until it finally reached the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the viso-screen and remained there. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew by leaps and bounds as the terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of the cruiser minimized the distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">long before the quarry was aware of pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But at last, when the enemy cruiser</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed on the viso-screen, unmistakably</seg><seg type="columnLine">for what it was--a pirate craft, it showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by its sudden maneuver that it had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tected the I.S.P. cruiser. For it had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribed a parabola in space and headed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dangerous asteroid belt. As if navi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gated by a masterly hand that knew each</seg><seg type="columnLine">and every orbit of the asteroids, it plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly into the asteroid drift, hoping to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose the I.S.P. cruiser with such a maneu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ver. Ordinarily, it would have succeeded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no I.S.P. patrol ship would have dared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture into such a trap without specific</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders. But to Dennis Brooke, directing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chase from the control room, even certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">death was welcome, if only he could take</seg><seg type="columnLine">Koerber with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Weaving through the deadly belt for</seg><seg type="columnLine">several hours, Dennis saw his quarry slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. Instantly he seized the chance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered a salvo from starboard. Koerber's</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful spacer reeled, dived and came up</seg><seg type="columnLine">spewing Genton-shells. The battle* was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the banked atomic-cannon of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I.S.P. Cruiser, a deadly curtain of atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire blazed at the pirate craft. A ragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent back toward midship showed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Koerber's Cruiser which trembled as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been mortally wounded. Then Den-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nis maneuvered his cruiser into a power</seg><seg type="columnLine">dive as a rain of Genton-shells swept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space lane above him, but as he came up, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lone shell struck. At such close range,</seg><seg type="columnLine">super-armor was ripped, second armor</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrated and the magnificent vessel shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the detonating impact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was then that Dennis Brooke saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the immense dark shadow looming imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately behind Koerber's ship. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pirate cruiser zoom desperately in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort to break the gravity trap of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">looming mass, but too late. It struggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a fly caught in a spider-web to no</seg><seg type="columnLine">avail. It was then that Koerber played bis</seg><seg type="columnLine">last card. Sensing he was doomed, he tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to draw the I.S.P. Cruiser down with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A powerful magnetic beam lashed out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear the I.S'.P. Cruiser.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH a wrenching turn that almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw them out of control, Dennis</seg><seg type="columnLine">maneuvered to avoid the beam. Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">Koerber's beam lashed out, as he sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower into the looming mass, and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dennis anticipating the maneuver avoided</seg><seg type="columnLine">it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "George Randall!" He shouted desper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately into the speaker. "Cut all jets in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket room! Hurry, man!" He banked</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and then zoomed out of the increas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing gravity trap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Randall! I've got to use the magnetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">repulsion plates . . . Cut all the jets 1" But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no response. Randall's screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained blank. Then Koerber's lashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnetic beam touched and the I.S.P. ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was caught, forced to follow the pirate</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship's plunge like the weight at the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a whiplash. Koerber's gunners sent one</seg><seg type="columnLine">parting shot, an atomic-blast that shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trapped cruiser like a leaf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beneath them, growing larger by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second, a small world rushed up to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. The readings in the Planetograph</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have gone crazy. It showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter 1200 miles; composition mineral</seg><seg type="columnLine">and radio-active. Gravity seven-eighths of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terra. It couldn't be! Unless perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">this unknown planetoid was the legendary</seg><seg type="columnLine">core of the world that at one time was sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to have existed between Jupiter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars. Only that could possibly explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">the incredible gravity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then began another type of battle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hearing the Captain's orders to Randall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SOUL EATERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">9</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and noting that no result had been obtained,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scotty Byrnes himself cut the jets. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Magnetic Repulsion Plates went into ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, too late to save them from being</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn, but at least they could prevent a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash. Far in the distance they could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Koerber's ship preceding them in a free</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall, then the Planetoid was rushing up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">engulf them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE atmosphere was somewhat tenu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous, but it was breathable, provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man didn't exert himself. To the silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew of the I.S.P. Cruiser, the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">world to which Koerber's magnetic Beam</seg><seg type="columnLine">had drawn them, was anything but reassur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Towering crags jutted raggedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the sky, and the iridescent soil</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the narrow valley that walled in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruiser, had a poisonous, deadly look. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as their eyes could reach, the desolate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">denuded vista stretched to the horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pretty much of a mess!" Dennis</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brooke's face was impassive as he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Scotty Byrnes. "What's your opinion?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Think we can patch her up, or are we</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuck here indefinitely?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spotty eyed the damage. The atom-blast</seg><seg type="columnLine">had penetrated the hull into the forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuel chambers and the armor had blos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">somed out like flower .petals. The crash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing had not helped either.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, there's a few beryloid plates in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the storage locker, Captain, but" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratched his head ruminatively and shifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his precious cud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what? Speak up man!" It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom Jeffery, his nerves on edge, his ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">narily gentle voice like a lash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, you may as well know it," Scotty</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied quietly. "That parting shot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Koerber's severed our main rocket feed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had to use the emergency tank to make it</seg><seg type="columnLine">down here!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long moment the four men looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at each other in silence. Dennis Brooke's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was still impassive but for the flaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">hazel eyes. Tom tugged at the torn sleeve</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his I.S'.P. uniform, while Scotty gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">mournfully at the damaged ship. Dallas</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bernan looked at the long, ragged line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think we got Koerber, though," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said at last. "While Tom was doing a job</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of navigation, I had one last glimpse of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming down fast and out of control some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where behind those crags over there!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To hell with Koerber!" Tom Jeffery</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploded. "You mean we're stuck in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">hellish rock-pile?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Easy, Tom!" Captain Brooke's tones</seg><seg type="columnLine">were like ice. On his pale, impassive face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes were like flaming topaz. "Where's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randall?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Probably hiding his head under a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunk!" Dallas laughed with scorn. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">contemptuous remark voiced the feelings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the entire crew. A man who failed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be at his battle-station in time of emerg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ency, had no place in the I.S.P.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Considering the gravity of this plan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">etoid," Dennis Brooke said thoughtfully,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"it's going to take some blast to get us off!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe we can locate a deposit of ane-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rioum or uranium or something for our</seg><seg type="columnLine">atom-busters to chew on!"

"Perhaps you wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain why you weren't at your battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">station ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sir, I wanted to know if ... if I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">help Scotty with the welding job . . ."</seg><seg type="columnLine">That wasn't at all what he'd intended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say. But somehow the words had stuck</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his throat and his face flushed deep scar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let. His candid blue eyes were suspiciously</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant, and the white bandage with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">crimson stains made an appealing, boyish</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure. It softened the anger in Brooke's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. Thinking it over calmly, Dennis</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized this was the youngster's first trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the outer orbits, and better men than</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had cracked in those vast reaches of</seg><seg type="columnLine">10	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">space. But there had been an instant when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd found Randall cowering in the rocket-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, in the grip of paralyzing hysteria,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he could cheerfully have wrung his</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly, Randall," he replied in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">much more kindly tone. "We'll need all</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you, sir!" Randall seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitate for a moment, opened his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak further, but feeling the other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculating gaze upon him, he whirled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">re-entered the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But for him we wouldn't be here!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dallas exclaimed. "Aagh !" He shook his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head in disgust until the several folds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh under his chin shook like gelatin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Cowards are hell!" He spat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Easy, Dallas, Randall's a kid, give 'im</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chance." Dennis observed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You Captain . . . you're defending 'im?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why you had a greater stake in this than</seg><seg type="columnLine">we, and he's spoiled it for you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yep," Dennis nodded. "But I'm still</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping my senses clear. No feuds on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. Get it!" The last two words cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a scimitar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dallas nodded and lowered his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scotty shifted his cud and spat a thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream of juice over the iridescent ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One by one they re-entered the cruiser.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ABSORBEDLY Randall added finish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing flourishes to the plate of beryloid</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had just finished welding. With the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy atomic welder in his hands, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused to inspect the job. Inwardly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished that Scotty and Dallas would hurry</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that final plate. He could just barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear them pounding it into shape, within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cruiser. Unconsciously he shivered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outside the cruiser, it was cold, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing was laborious, for despite the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity, the atmosphere was thin, diffused.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Besides, this shadowy world of dark crags</seg><seg type="columnLine">and palely creeping sunlight had an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">canny feel, as if it were evil. For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundredth time he twisted around and sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veyed the rocky terrain behind him. De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terminedly he squared his shoulders and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jutted out his chin. It was bad enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have muffed a chance to add glory to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I.S.P., not to speak of having the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crew think him demented. Still the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling of being watched persisted. Ran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dall cursed his imagination, and over-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wrought nerves that made him feel what</seg><seg type="columnLine">palpably didn't exist. He closed his young</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes for a second and strove to steady his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He breathed deeply of the tenuous at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosphere and exhaled slowly; then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened his eyes, feeling more calm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to make one final survey, and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooted to the ground as if petrified.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From a dark crevice in the jagged wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the I.S.P. Spacer, something seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to glide effortlessly into the open. About</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty feet from Randall it paused and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained stationary, hovering above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocky surface. It was perfectly spherical,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully three feet in diameter, and had George</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randall not been hysterical with dread, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have seen that it was exquisitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful, a softly shining, transparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe that pulsed rhythmically with lam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent fires. A wavering, lavender corona,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an aura, surrounded it as it began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spin slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From nerveless hands the atomic welder</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped to the ground, as a wave of surg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing panic engulfed Randall. With an eerie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-strangled scream he clawed for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atom-blast at his hip. He had a brief im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression that the globe was sentiently alive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that something that felt like ten4*ils"</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fire probed his brain. His hair stood on</seg><seg type="columnLine">end as the icy fear deepened to the verge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of madness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Scotty! Dallas !" He shouted, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then realized he couldn't be heard above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pounding within the cruiser. He aimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the globe and squeezed the trigger. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous energy released by the atom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast flung the globe back, by blasting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounding air in furious waves, but re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaining its equilibrium the globe began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">zoom forward again, undamaged!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Randall waited no longer, he raced for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open hatch of the cruiser with the speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of horror. He scrambled madly, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">dived into the opening and had the pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence of mind to pull the lever that slammed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door shut behind him. He lay there</seg><seg type="columnLine">panting, completely unnerved by the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dishevelled and horror-stricken was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way Scotty and Dallas found him, when on</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing the hatch clang shut, they rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in to investigate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What happened, an attack? Koerber's</seg><seg type="columnLine">men?" Scotty queried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SOUL EATERS	11</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Speak up, Randall!" Dallas shook him</seg><seg type="columnLine">briefly. "What was it? You look as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd seen a ghost!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's something out there ... I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what it is, but it's alive. It almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">got me!" He shuddered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Something alive on this barren world?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unless it was one of Koerber's men, you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">been seeing ghosts again, kid!" Scotty said</seg><seg type="columnLine">not unkindly. He was well aware of space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men's mirage, the affliction that sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove newcomers mad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was real," Randall persisted. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was alive ... a glowing globe of energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hung just above me, a few feet away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I blasted at it with my gun, and it just</seg><seg type="columnLine">spun, then came forward."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE ROSE from the floor and moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to the starboard port to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside. Scotty and Dallas stood beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. They gazed curiously in every direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, as far as they could see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't see a thing," Dallas said stolidly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come on, son! I'll fix you a sedative,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said contemptuously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait a minute Dallas," Scotty inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupted. "Randall's right. Take a look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that b.'cf pile of rocks over there ... to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left, Dallas!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the red-tailed Picaroons on Jupiter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">satellites!" Dallas swore swiftly. "I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen a lot of queer sights, but nothing like</seg><seg type="columnLine">this!" he exclaimed. Suddenly he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Randall. "How do you know it's alive?</seg><seg type="columnLine">For all we know it's just a globe of radio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">active energy native to this hell-spot."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randall colored, hesitated and finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurted out. "I ... I just felt it was alive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sensed it trying to contact my mind . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oh, I know it sounds crazy, I know you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh, but the thing was trying to probe my</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain, Dallas!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scotty suddenly thought of Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brooke and Tom Jeffery who had gone on</seg><seg type="columnLine">an exploratory trip. "I wonder about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain and Tom," he said in alarm. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's one of these whirling demons on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this rock there's sure to be others." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">raced to the communications set and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">it on. But it was silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dallas gazed at Randall for a second with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a faint, scornful smile. "Alive, eh? We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">see." He patted the atom-blast at his hip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Never saw nothin' dangerous yet that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">this couldn't put a hole through!" He ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed inelegantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold on, Dallas!" The more prudent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scotty tried to dissuade him. "If that</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing's radio-active, it may be deadly!</seg><seg type="columnLine">We're not afraid of it, man . . . but we</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know what it is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You boys stay and play the radio!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dallas turned lightly on his feet for all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous bulk and soon the airlock had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hissed open and he was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both Scotty and Randall watched him</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-fearful, half in admiration as he strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the cruiser. The luminous, iri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">descent sphere hovering over the rocks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled faster and faster as Dallas moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the ship. Rapidly the whirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">accelerated until it was a pulsing vortex of</seg><seg type="columnLine">exquisite hues of living light. Then, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to move slowly forward toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the macabre landscape of the plane-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toid, the rotund Dallas was not unlike a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere himself, as gun in hand he unhesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tatingly went forward to meet the globe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Calmly he aimed the atom-blast and sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly there was a flash from the muzzle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun. But the flood of vicious atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy failed to harm the globe, on the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trary, it seemed to flame in a cataract of</seg><seg type="columnLine">colors, flaming into living light. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluorescent flare died down to normal again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the sphere stopped, motionless as if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were appraising Dallas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In unfeigned wonder, the blimp-like Dal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">las Bernan stared at the globe. "A full</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge from the blaster, and the damn thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes it like a drink of milk!" he murmured</seg><seg type="columnLine">audibly. Reaching over he picked up 'a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good sized rock and threw it at the sphere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the rock bounced back as if it had hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">an impenetrable wall of energy. The globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unharmed, it merely hung there qui-</seg><seg type="columnLine">escent now, as if observing the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature from another planet that had sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another rock followed the first, then an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other and another, until rocks were flying in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every direction as they rebounded from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe. And Dallas began to laugh! To</seg><seg type="columnLine">his matter-of-fact mind, the sphere was</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely a bunch of radio-active gas that</seg><seg type="columnLine">repelled matter of certain types like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones he had thrown, and was drawn by</seg><seg type="columnLine">organic matter. A bunch of gas! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared. And the globe was retreating,</seg><seg type="columnLine">12</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">floating backwards effortlessly, whirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster and faster, until as Dallas flung a</seg><seg type="columnLine">final rock it darted upward and swiftly dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared down the great valley. As Dallas</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to go back to the cruiser, a flicker</seg><seg type="columnLine">of movement caught his eye. Instantly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">aimed his atom-blast, but as quickly low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered, and a joyous expression came into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his vast face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clambering down the tumbled rocks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulders just ahead of the spacer, Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brooke and Tom Jeffery were hurrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him, the latter carrying the insul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated leadite specimen box.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hiya, Captain! We just laid a ghost.</seg><seg type="columnLine">See our pretty company?" Dallas roared</seg><seg type="columnLine">with laughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, we saw it," Captain Brooke re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied. "What was it ? Looked like a trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent globe of some sort. Radioactive?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Naw! Just a bunch of gas!" Dallas</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, we have another kind of company</seg><seg type="columnLine">. . . about twenty miles from here," Dennis</seg><seg type="columnLine">said grimly. "Get into the ship, we're hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a conference, Dallas."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SEATED in the small dining-room of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruiser, the entire crew listened to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain's report on their trip, while Scotty</seg><seg type="columnLine">brewed coffee skillfully and cocked his ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the narrative. Tom laid the leadite</seg><seg type="columnLine">specimen box on the table without a word,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then sat back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll cut corners on this," he began. "Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause we have a lot to do, and a very short</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to do it in. Approximately twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles westwards, there's a cavern that runs</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the crags around us. Jeffery and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I started to explore it, but fortunately</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped just in time. It happens that Koer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber and his thugs have landed on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the crags. This cave is filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort of radioactive mineral, unfor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunately, the main deposits are at the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the cavern system, and Koerber and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gang are already in possession! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have crashed there. Pity the situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion is not reversed, we'd have ample fuel</seg><seg type="columnLine">then!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, Captain," Randall spoke impulsive-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, "why can't we get some of the mineral</seg><seg type="columnLine">from this end of the cavern and blast off</seg><seg type="columnLine">this awful place?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dallas gave the youngster a look of</seg><seg type="columnLine">withering disgust from across the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No good," Tom Jeffery answered for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Captain without looking at Randall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The stuff at this end's mostly rubble; we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to dig the better part of an hour to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">a piece rich enough to use." He pointed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leadite box.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The plan is simplicity itself," Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brooke continued. "We'll use this speci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men for fuel to zoom over the crags and</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack Koerber . . . we've got to take pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">session of the other end of the cave. With-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out sufficient fuel, we can't fight Koerber</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a finish, and I intend to go into that</seg><seg type="columnLine">black cruiser of his if I have to crack it</seg><seg type="columnLine">open like a Venusian palm-nut!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dallas and Scotty's eyes glowed.

"That</seg><seg type="columnLine">mineral's terrific!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was just thinking the same thing,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Brooke agreed quietly. "Which</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes it doubly important that we settle</seg><seg type="columnLine">scores with Koerber and leave this plane-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toid. If the reaction of this mineral's true,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we've found a new type of fuel, far more</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful than anything known to us at</seg><seg type="columnLine">present."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Imagine if that space-rat gets hold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it," Jeffery concurred in awed tones. "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could rule the space-lanes, commit any</seg><seg type="columnLine">crime and outpace any ship in the uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Besides," Dennis said ruminatively, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">mineral'd make Terra independent of Ve-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nus for her supply of radioactives. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would usher in a new era, Jeffery!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly it seemed to Dennis that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was even more at stake than the smashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a dangerous outlaw, than the recovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his former state in the I.S.P., or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">avenging of Marla, if she were dead'--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">destiny of Terra was at stake too. As if</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of those cross-roads of Life, at which</seg><seg type="columnLine">an individual is sometimes poised by fate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had opened before his gaze, and history</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaited being written in the invisible pages</seg><seg type="columnLine">of space. He had come prepared to die to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fulfill a mission--but now matters had</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed. The need was not to die, but to</seg><seg type="columnLine">live, that an unsuspecting world might rise</seg><seg type="columnLine">to new heights of achievement on the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credibly radioactive marvel of this un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known planetoid. With a swift movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">he threw on the panel switch, and his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">boomed out:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All hands attention! Koerber has seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, no doubt. But whether or not he's fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned, we attack as scheduled. Stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">by!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The I.S.P. Cruiser swept back up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long valley, until it was almost opposite the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pirate's camp. Only the tremendous moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain range separated them. Glancing at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">banks of keys, the instruments and dials</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the V-Screen, Dennis issued orders:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Scotty, give it everything you have!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He grinned as Scotty gave back one of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">inimitable replies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dallas!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take the stern turret, and start firing</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we pull out--angle thirty-eight, pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cision !" He again threw a quick glance at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the panel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Randall! Take forward position, sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ondary turret. Hold fire till they open up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or until I give you the command. Got it ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, sir," Randall's voice was tense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was then Captain Dennis turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his Navigator. "I'll take the main forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">turret myself, Jeffery! Now, use a thirty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five degree dive, pull out at five-hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet and use MA-24 to pull out and regain</seg><seg type="columnLine">altitude." He grinned fleetingly at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled Jeffery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But . . . but you're going to man the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward turret--get the gunner, Cap'n . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">I . . ." But Dennis silenced him with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift gesture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Taking no chances, I want to be sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">14	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that spawn of Barrabas's smeared, if I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do it myself!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LONG, gleaming cruiser was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spear of the Angel Gabriel, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erring, fatal, as the skillful fingers of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">navigator in the control room swept over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the keys and the ship obediently canted</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward. Suddenly it took the plunge</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a supernal power-dive that sent it hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tling straight at the Pirate's camp below.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All around the cruiser a rain of Genton-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shells exploded in buffeting succession, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cruiser quivered and strained holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dizzying dive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the main forward turret, a stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fire scorched the surroundings below,</seg><seg type="columnLine">starting great fires on the stacked supplies</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been removed from Koerber's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship to facilitate repairs. The atomo-blast</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised clouds of iridescent mineral as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">peeled the ground like a gigantic knife.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the Genton-Shells prevented close aim,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the explosions buffeted the cruiser off</seg><seg type="columnLine">her course. Captain Dennis finally came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the control room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They saw us, all right," he growled</seg><seg type="columnLine">angrily. "I wasn't able to come closer</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a hundred feet of Koerber's ship with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They've almost got us boxed in, sir.

Two pirates caught behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounds of supplies and provisions were</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasted together with the boxes that pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tected them. The stern turret of the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pirate cruiser was a melting, incandescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass as Captain Brooke's atom-blast</seg><seg type="columnLine">found its mark. Suddenly the meteor-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel canted to the right and zoomed up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward at the same time, then with verti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginous speed flashed beyond the range of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pirate's full fire-power, leaving Koer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber cursing in impotent fury. The sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wracking concussions died away; the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthly ascending whine of the atom-blasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased, and the cruiser flashed back to base.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"At least we'll have a choice this time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">where to set the ship down," Lieutenant</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jeffery said wryly, as he watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed scene on the V-screen before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Watching also, Dennis Brooke suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned forward with great interest, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly the emergency thermo-bulb flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on and off and a shrill buzzer sounded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dennis threw the switch quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll have to set her down, Cap'n!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scotty announced.

Jeffery exclaimed succinctly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Set her down 1" Dennis ordered, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship was already headed groundwards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The air lock on the cruiser opened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crew jumped to the ground.

Randall, for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever impulsive and emotional, asked, curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously apprehensive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You probably won't like the idea so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much, Lieutenant," Captain Brooke said</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly, shifting the weight of his atom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast on his hip. He smiled thinly, "We're</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to investigate some of those play-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mates of yours--the spheres!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Randall's face tightened with a peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression. He started to speak, then not-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Dallas' sardonic smile, he stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just before we landed," the Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued, "I saw a large pit filled with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">globes up in the plateau just ahead. I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to try an experiment. From what I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened with you Dallas, when you tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to blast that globe and then threw rocks at</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and it went away, and yet, it pursued</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randall . . . well, I have a theory that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to test. If it works, we may yet turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tables on Koerber."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH perfect confidence, Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dennis turned and began to stride to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the plateau in the near distance. With-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out hesitation Dallas strode behind him, fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed by Scotty and Jeffery, and a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">other lesser members of the crew. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randall hesitated as if an awful premoni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion paralyzed his steps. He seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make an heroic effort, and hesitantly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SOUL EATERS	15</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">first, then with greater confidence he began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow the leaders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last they were standing at the rim</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the vast pit; looking down, Dennis real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized it must be all of a mile in width. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed filled with clusters of the globes</seg><seg type="columnLine">which vibrated gently at the bottom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Millions of the damned things!" Dallas</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pit sloped down to a point at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the bottom, and there was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense cluster of globes that Dennis had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen. From small ones, the size of thermo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulbs, to gigantic spheres fully six feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in diameter, it was a pulsating, shimmering</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of changing opalescences, a seething</seg><seg type="columnLine">cauldron of prismatic hues, dormant now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but ready to flame into living light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Randall, the last to arrive, approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge and gazed down. The ethereal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghostly seeming spheres with their pulsat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing auras sent an icy shiver of dread along</seg><seg type="columnLine">his taut nerves. He shuddered and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the others. "Let's go," he said hoarsely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Those demons might come floating up</seg><seg type="columnLine">here!" There was a hysterical quality to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice that did not pass unnoticed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Dennis, who was observing him</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely. "Let's go!" Randall cried again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face contorted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly there was a stream of move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment below; from the central mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">globes, several detached themselves and</seg><seg type="columnLine">floated silently upwards in swirls of living</seg><seg type="columnLine">light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cold, unreasoning fear surged into Ran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dall's mind. In his hysteria, the spheres</seg><seg type="columnLine">were coming* after him! His thin face*</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the wide, fear-stricken blue eyes wag</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashen while his lips twitched to form words</seg><seg type="columnLine">that failed to come. At last he managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream: "Run ! They're coming after us."</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Randall was racing pell-mell back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spacer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Dennis stood his ground, Dallas</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside him. "Come here, you fool!" Den-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nis cried exasperated. But it was too late.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With flashing speed two of the spheres</seg><seg type="columnLine">outraced Randall and now hovered over</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. They were whirling into a vortex of</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible light, lovely beyond description,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and beneath them, convulsed with horror,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randall raced for his life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Action!" Dennis shouted. Instantly sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral atom-blasts spewed their deadly charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the two pursuing globes. They drank</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in the awful energy charge and glowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">supernally vivid, still unharmed, then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swooping downwards they charged Ran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dall, and the boy was fighting them, flail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his amis wildly, haphazardly trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fend them off. The other members of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">party had now held their fire, for Randall</seg><seg type="columnLine">was enmeshed in the luminous globes. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly the globes seemed to become part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the boy's body, enveloping it in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">translucent, fatal embrace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before their eyes, they saw the boyish</seg><seg type="columnLine">form shrivel and fall crumpled to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground as if all the energy had been ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorbed in that unearthly embrace of living</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. In an instant it was over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LAZILY, the two spheres floated up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, their fire deepening into swirls</seg><seg type="columnLine">of colors, swirling slowly over the pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trate figure as if exulting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unutterable horror showed in Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brooke's eyes; then flaming anger shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "The dirty . . Dennis ground out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words from set, taub*?ps. Furiously he</seg><seg type="columnLine">began blasting at the globes. The spheres</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocked and twisted in the tortured air cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rents, then gradually they rose and floated</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dennis kneeled beside the still form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randall; slid his hand under the boy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">jacket.

Jeffery sat with his long hands on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lap, silent, while Scotty methodically</seg><seg type="columnLine">tamped down the Venusian tobacco with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had filled his blackened pipe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dallas said nothing. His vast bulk over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowed the seat and his tremendous chest</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaved with emotions alien to his nature.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All of them seemed to be waiting for Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain Dennis Brooke's words. The latter sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">down last, absorbed in thought. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke, his voice was quiet, sombre almost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I told you," he began without pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amble, "that I had a vague theory about</seg><seg type="columnLine">those spheres. Well, I know now. Randall</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved it this afternoon. There can be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt that those globes are radio-active--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way they react to our atomo-guns leads</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to believe that they subsist on energy--</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiant energy from the mineral and radio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">actives of this planetoid. Their atomic scale</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be such that their component atoms</seg><seg type="columnLine">make up the two mining elements in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic scale! This is the first time that man</seg><seg type="columnLine">has ever encountered these two elements.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And of course, this is the first time these</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres have ever encountered humans--</seg><seg type="columnLine">organic life--on an atomic scale so far</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed from their own. Naturally they're</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious. They tried to investigate and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what they encountered from Randall was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear! Perhaps the second strongest emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Our fear must send out intangible</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrations that impinge harshly upon their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own vibrations and lead them to attack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What fear arouses in them, we shall prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably never know. The fact is that our hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man emotion of fear in conflict with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibratory rate renders them fatal, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even seems to draw them with a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnetic attraction!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment every one of the four</seg><seg type="columnLine">was silent, as the explanation cleared so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much of the mystery before them. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Dennis walked over to the locker</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the space-suits were racked. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">began slipping into one of the bulky suits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going outside again.

He dogged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last clamp into place and moved heavily</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MEN watching from the gun tur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rets saw Dennis approach the vast pit</seg><seg type="columnLine">which seemed to be the abode of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere. The face-plate of his helmet was</seg><seg type="columnLine">open. For minutes he stood motionless on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rim of the pit. They knew he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentrating, duplicating the emotion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear. Then with a catch in their throats</seg><seg type="columnLine">they observed groups of the spheres rise</seg><seg type="columnLine">majestically from the depths and swoop</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the waiting Dennis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a swift gesture Captain Brooke</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped the face-plate closed.

In the brief interval</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spheres had darted into action, sweep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing closer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turning at last, Captain Dennis strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the ship, and slowly the flaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">globes sank back into the pit out of sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It works," Scotty yelled delightedly, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other men ran to their airlock to greet</seg><seg type="columnLine">their Captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once again at the table, Dennis began:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now we can have a definite plan.

That</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, the one to enter Koerber's camp, will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the bait for the spheres.

He sat silent, the faint satiri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal smile still on his lips, as if for once</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his life the very depths of his involved</seg><seg type="columnLine">and merciless soul were filled with joy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as indeed was the case. "Speak your</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece!" he said insolently, and motioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the guards to cover the exit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shall be brief," Dennis shrugged his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders.

Koerber said</seg><seg type="columnLine">imperiously. Instantly the two gunmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">went into action, prodding Dennis with</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn blasters.

He sat up on the cold metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, and strove to point his mind to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">task ahead. And the last midget speaker</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped from his pocket to roll across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, coming to a stop at a corner of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wall.

All</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fear he felt for Marla, all the horror</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the murder of his comrades and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction of his cruiser, and the vast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful vision of a universe ruled by a sad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istic madman, utterly evil, began to flood</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his mind as he willed himself to emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionally see these things realized.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he was aware that through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">auto-siiggestion, he was beginning to feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear, real fear!

A myriad rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of lavender, greens, pulsing reds and flam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boyant blues, iridescent, flaming with in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward fires and spinning ever faster the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectral globes swept downwards in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deepening twilight with dazzling speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get the gun working, you scum !'* Koer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber cursed, pointing to the portable atomo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray still remaining outside the spacer.

Blasting fiercely for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few seconds, the two outlaws hesitated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Astonishment then fear crossed their stub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled faces. The deadly ray was merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">expanding the globes, which flared into</seg><seg type="columnLine">incandescent light and, kept right on com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Huge chunks out of the side of the cliff</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the zooming spheres crashed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain.

Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly, Koerber shouted again. One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men near the stern of the ship had dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his weapon and was running, horror-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken, across the broken ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come back here, you rat!" Koerber</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieked, swinging the big atomo-ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">around.

Uncontrollable</seg><seg type="columnLine">passion twisted his features in a fiendish</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarl at the thought of losing the supreme</seg><seg type="columnLine">power and unimaginable wealth he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought to be within his grasp. His voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose piercingly above the concussions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the atomite capsules that at his command</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been brought into action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But unknown to him, stealthily, a grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing fear was creeping into his brain as all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his efforts and the deadly fire of atom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasts, atomo-ray and atomite capsules</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to even destroy a single globe. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">unearthly, macabre appearance of the lumi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nous globes was already playing havoc</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the men's minds, and one by one the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlaws fled shrieking into the darkness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be consumed by the glowing spheres.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THE impenetrable blackness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave, Dennis Brooke had stopped build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the emotion of fear. With part of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind he sought to dispel the stubborn auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypnosis, and slowly, he was able to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gain a measure of normalcy. The thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Marla helped, as with the growing de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction of Koerber's men, he deliberately</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced himself to see her safe, in his arms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And slowly he came back out of the abyss</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fear into which he had purposely pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his courageous mind. It took patience,</seg><seg type="columnLine">infinite patience and time, but time was</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing short. He rubbed the frayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonds that bound his arms back of him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the jagged outcroppings of radio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">22</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">active rock, until he burst them with her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culean strength, then it took a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds to free his legs. Painfully he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood up, and let the blood course with ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quisite torture through his semi-paralyzed</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs. Then he sought the tiny atom-blast</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marla had given him to conceal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The space in front of the black spacer</seg><seg type="columnLine">was milling with men battling spheres, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vortex of flaring illumination that hungrily</seg><seg type="columnLine">enveloped the maddened crew. Now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, another man sank to the ground a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifeless hulk. Suddenly one of the spheres</seg><seg type="columnLine">came floating into the cave, curious, at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracted by the remnants of the fear vibra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions and approached Dennis. The Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain saw it enter and illuminate the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrable darkness, he laughed. A few</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments ago it would have meant his life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but now he contemptuously bent down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">picking a glittering specimen of radioactive</seg><seg type="columnLine">mineral flung it unerringly at the gently</seg><seg type="columnLine">spinning globe. As if the sphere weren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">even there, the I. S. P. Captain strode out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cave. It was then he saw his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew, space-suited, exultant, spewing green</seg><seg type="columnLine">death from their atom-blasts at the milling</seg><seg type="columnLine">remnants of what had been the scourge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the space-lanes. Far to one side he spied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Koerber, now a demoniac figure still firing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the few remaining charges left in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomo-ray. Saw him finally drop the use-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less weapon and turn to fend off the swoop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing spheres. In a few bounds Dennis was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the sight of Dennis, the scowling face</seg><seg type="columnLine">went black with fury. He sprang forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">with both arms jabbing like pistons. Dennis</seg><seg type="columnLine">swerved and again planted a terrific left</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Koerber's solar-plexus, it almost doubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pirate over, but Koerber was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">through. He knew death was very close,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he meant to take with him the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">man he blamed for his defeat. He came</seg><seg type="columnLine">in with a fury that swept all before him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">impervious of the rain of blows that Dennis</seg><seg type="columnLine">aimed at his face, and unleashing a right</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Dennis' jaw, he put every ounce of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maining power behind it. But the I. S. P.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain moved slightly, letting the blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiz past his face, then flat-footed, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">let his right ride with the power of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sledge-hammer. Koerber's face lost con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tour, a gout of dark, welling blood flooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">over it and he sank to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Dennis' own men saw him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came running to where he stood planted</seg><seg type="columnLine">over what remained of Koerber, pirate of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the space lanes. His chest heaving, clothes</seg><seg type="columnLine">torn, he heard them as if in a dream, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they shouted in joy at the complete victory</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had achieved. It was only when cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands touched his face, and a remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragrance was in his nostrils, that he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of his daze. A voice was whispering</seg><seg type="columnLine">the simple words, "my dear . . . my very</seg><seg type="columnLine">dear!" Slowly he gathered Marla in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms and kissed her tenderly, while around</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, the hovering spheres sensed another</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion, greater even than fear--but of</seg><seg type="columnLine">another kind--that greatest of all emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, Love.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CAPTAIN DENNIS chewed the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his stylus.

Haw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thorne stared unbelievingly at the trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation. Flowers were spread pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusely. Embroidered antimacassars graced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dainty chairs. And the curtains over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ports were indeed of chenille. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot groaned dismally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But O'Dea's eyes lighted when he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the huge portrait over the control board.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mercedes!" he shouted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Oh how happy I am to see you</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased!" exclaimed Morguma. "We found</seg><seg type="columnLine">this divine female human being's picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">and enlarged it as you see. She is an en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trancing thing!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You talk the truth," O'Dea agreed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"But that won't change the fact that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't like you. What happens now?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morguma looked mildly apologetic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now we must perform labor! The great</seg><seg type="columnLine">task for which this ship has been fitted!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Centaur seated himself at the rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the control room, produced an instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment that looked like a whip. It looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a whip because it was one. He flicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">it experimentally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh how devastated I would be," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told them, "if I should be forced to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">this! You will take off and fly to our as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teroid -belt, following the intelligent direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions I shall give you. We will find a sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantial piece of some agreeable material</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bring it back to Avignon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two men looked at each other and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then at the whip. The alien snapped it</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly a few times as if nervous. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the control board.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A FEW HOURS later they were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alpha Centauri's asteroid belt, dodg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing debris. For a while they were nervous.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was here, in this field of small flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">particles that was worse even than their</seg><seg type="columnLine">Solar System's, that a baseball-sized rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">had eluded their detectors and knifed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through their vessel, passing through all</seg><seg type="columnLine">three fuel chambers in its line of flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and taking a long stream of rocket fuel</seg><seg type="columnLine">for its wake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the Centaurs evidently had per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fected asteroid navigation; and when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw several pieces of matter that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to strike them deflected, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped worrying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> O'Dea manned a board lined with in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struments the Centaurs had installed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were simple to operate. He merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved a telescope lens until a piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cosmic scrap was in the cross hair, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he read a dial. The telescope was synchro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized with a Centaur version of a spec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">troscope, and its reading was given in</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures on the dial.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt the Centaur looking over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, checking up on him, so he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do his work properly. Not that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">made much difference. Whether he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawthorne played the game was of little</seg><seg type="columnLine">importance as far as the Centaur's plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">went, except that the creatures liked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">symbolism created by having- two humans</seg><seg type="columnLine">work on the project.</seg><seg type="columnLine">ME1V WITHOUT A WORLD	29</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Morguma," he said.

Morguma marveled. "This pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet of Avignon is the reservation we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have set aside for all space work.

Now the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft that disturb the peace of our people</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the main planets of Centauri are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rockets that transport materials and work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers to and from Avignon!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thereis something wrong* there."</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Dea centered his instrument on the as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teroid. "You seem, to- be happy enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the other workers on Avignon--they</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't seem to be disgusted by the dirt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I am ecstatic!" Morguma raved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is my aptitude! Rocket fuel is my life</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood!

As for that re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark about rocket fuel's being your life</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloom, Morguma, I happen to know it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">true!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He chuckled at the look of discomfiture</seg><seg type="columnLine">that spread over Morguma's features. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">quintal that was a part of rocket fuel</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the equivalent of alcohol to the me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tabolism of the Centaurs. Several times</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had seen Morguma take a quick pull</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a small bottle he kept in his leathery</seg><seg type="columnLine">garment--the Centaur version of a hip</seg><seg type="columnLine">flask.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Morguma changed the subject as</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Dea's throaty chuckle continued. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to the grayish speck in the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh a remarkable find! A lump of</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid carbon dioxide, and of such a size!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Oh how fortunate we are to have such</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunate fortune!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their vessel closed in on the chunk of</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost pure carbon dioxide, a piece larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the ship. Under the Centaur's direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, O'Dea fed out the seizure beams.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He watched the rough mass become grad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually rigid, fixed in space relative to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That seizure beam would interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth's scientists. But Earth was tril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions of miles away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morguma clapped his paws together in</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolish delight.

The figures they reported</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be turned into a central office, along</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the results of other ships engaged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same task. In that way, the Centaurs</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked the composition of the atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere they were creating for the planet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew what elements were most necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">at any given moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They swooped low over the planet, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side opposite the space base. Other</seg><seg type="columnLine">Centaurs were bringing laden ships down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosing their cargoes like sticks of bombs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A great plateau was speckled with white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and below, the ocean bed was filling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hawthorne joined the procession of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Centaur ships. When they neared the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, he barked at O'Dea to loosen their</seg><seg type="columnLine">load. The seizure beams disappeared and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the icy chunk splashed over several acres</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A successful mission!" Morguma gig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled. "Now we return to our lovely base</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rest!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> O'Dea and Hawthorne glowered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day was similar to the first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the one after it, and all the rest until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had turned in a dozen days of work</seg><seg type="columnLine">as slaves in the asteroid belt. O'Dea be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came proficient in operating his instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments ; and Hawthorne brushed up on pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cision bombing until he could have planted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his loads on a dime, if anybody had pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided the dime.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They found out that the Centaurs didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe in resting on the Sabbath. Working</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours were roughly from sunup to sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">30	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">down--about an eight hour stretch, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">Avignon's day was shorter than Earth's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At dawn, a skipping troop of young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Centaurs invaded their chambers. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">students were learning English, diplomatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">French, South Martian Portuguese, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a score of other languages of which Haw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thorne and O'Dea knew' nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Morguma came and led them to a.</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge boiler factory that was fitted as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dining room, where they toyed with Cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taur food and ate vita-horm capsules sal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaged from their ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After that, it was out to the asteroid</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt for another load of frozen atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Hell," said O'Dea.

"If it wasn't for that picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mercedes, I'd throw in my buttons.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm dying to see a human being again!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawthorne's homely face turned sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piciously to him. "I'm here, ain't I?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Dea raised an eyebrow and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. A fleet of powerful Centaur dread-</seg><seg type="columnLine">naughts was landing. They had just per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed the fabulous task of transporting</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge frozen lake to Avignon--a miracle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of coordination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> O'Dea filled his lungs with air. He re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved the blanket from his shoulders, let</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chest rise and fall evenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Almost as good as Earth," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This air is wonderful now, but it's wasted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only two humans to breathe it--hey!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stared at the spindly mountain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose to a dizzy peak at the far end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley.

O'Dea made a fist</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his right hand, rubbed it thoughtfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he shrugged, looking at the Centaur's</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve arms. They continued into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">noisy dining room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they entered, Hawthorne stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">short and glared.

You can kill me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I don't have to stand for--this!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HIS GESTURE swept the huge room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On every chair was hung bouquets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of riotously colored Centaurian flowers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The walls were padded with garlands, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge vases were in the center of each</seg><seg type="columnLine">table. From the ceiling, more streamers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blossoms dipped low.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> O'Dea's lips twitched, trying to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">back a grin.

Outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">a driverless hydrocar stood with idling</seg><seg type="columnLine">motors. The old woman threw herself into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the control seat, yanked me in after her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and threw over the starting stud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An instant later we were plunging</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the dark night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UNIVERSE	39</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SIX DAYS after leaving Swamp City</seg><seg type="columnLine">we reached Level Five, the last out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">post of firm ground. Ahead lay the inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">marsh, stretching as far as the eye could</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach. Low islands projected at intervals</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the thick water. Mold balls, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet across, drifted down from the slate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray sky like puffs of cotton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had traveled this far by ganet, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tough little two headed pack animal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Venus hinterland.

The thousand sounds of the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">marsh droned steadily. And the news</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadcast I had heard over the portable</seg><seg type="columnLine">visi just before retiring still lingered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind. To a casual observer that broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast would have meant little, a slight re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellion here, an isolated crime there. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">viewed from the perspective Grannie had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given me, everything dovetailed. The sit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uation on Jupiter was swiftly coming to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a head. Not only had the people on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet demanded that representative gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernment be abolished, but a forum was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now being held to find a leader who might</seg><seg type="columnLine">take complete dictatorial control.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outside a whisper-worm hissed softly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I got up and strode out of my tent.

It charged, and with but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a split second to act, I threw myself flat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">^ There was a rush of mighty wings as the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> thing swept over me. Sharp talons raked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> my clothing. Again it came, and again I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> rolled swiftly, missing the thing by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> narrowest of margins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   From the tent opposite a gaunt figure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> clad in a familiar dress appeared.

This</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> time the old woman's heat gun clicked,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and a tracery of purple flame shot outward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A horrible soul-chilling scream rent the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> air. A moment later something huge and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> heavy scrabbled across the ground and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> shot aloft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I stood frozen as the diminuendo of its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> wild cries echoed back to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "In heaven's name, what was it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hunter-bird," Grannie said calmly. "A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> form of avian life found here in the swamp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harmless in its wild state, but when cap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tured, it can be trained to pursue a quarry</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> until it kills.

"Billy-boy, our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> every move is being watched. From now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> on it's the survival of the fittest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">THE FOLLOWING day was our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seventh in the swamp. The water</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">here resembled a vast mosaic, striped and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cross-striped with long winding ribbons</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of yellowish substance that floated a few</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">inches below the surface. The mold balls</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">coming into contact with the evonium</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">water of the swamp had undergone a chem-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ical change and evolved into a cohesive</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">multi-celled marine life that lived and died</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">within a space of hours. The Venusians</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">paddled with extreme care. Had one of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them dipped his hand into one of those</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow streaks, he would have been de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voured in a matter of seconds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At high noon by my Earth watch I</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighted a low white structure on one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distant islands. Moments later we</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a landing at a rude jetty, and Gran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nie Annie was introducing me to Ezra</seg><seg type="columnLine">Karn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was not as old a man as I had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected, but he was ragged and unkempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">with iron gray hair falling almost to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders. He was dressed in varpa cloth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Venus equivalent of buckskin, and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head was an enormous flop-brimmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Glad to meet you," he said, shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hand. "Any friend of Miss Flowers</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a friend of mine/' He ushered us down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the catwalk into his hut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The place was a two room affair, small</seg><seg type="columnLine">but comfortable. The latest type of visi</seg><seg type="columnLine">set in one corner showed that Karn was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not isolated from civilization entirely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Grannie Annie came to the point</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly. When she had explained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">object of our trip, the prospector became</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Green Flames, eh ?" he repeated slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well yes, I suppose I could find that space</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship again. That is, if I wanted to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean?" Grannie paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the act of rolling herself a cigarette.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You know where it is, don't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ye-s," Karn nodded. "But like I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">you before, that ship lies in Varsoom</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, and that isn't exactly a summer</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacation spot."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are the Varsoom?" I asked. "A</seg><seg type="columnLine">native tribe?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Karn shook his head. "They're a form</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life that's never been seen by Earthmen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strictly speaking, they're no more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of energy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dangerous ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes and no. Only man I ever heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of who escaped their country outside of</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself was the explorer, Darthier, three</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago. I got away because I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, and they didn't notice me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Darthier escaped because he made 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Laugh?" A scowl crossed Grannie's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right," Karn said. "The Var-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soom have a strange nervous reaction that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">manifested by laughing. But just what</seg><seg type="columnLine">DOCTOR UNIVERSE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">41</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it is that makes them laugh, I don't know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Food supplies and fresh drinking water</seg><seg type="columnLine">were replenished at the hut. Several mold</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns were borrowed from the prospector's</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply to arm the Venusians. And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we were about to leave, Karn suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Doctor Universe program," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "I ain't missed one in months. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotta wait 'til I hear it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grannie frowned in annoyance, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospector was adamant. He flipped a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stud, twisted a dial and a moment later</seg><seg type="columnLine">was leaning back in a chair, listening with</seg><seg type="columnLine">avid interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the same show I had witnessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in Swamp City. Once again I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions filter in from the far outposts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the System. Once again I saw the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manding figure of the quiz master as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">strode back and forth across the stage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as I sat there, looking into the visi</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen, a curious numbing drowsiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to steal over me and lead my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts far away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HALF an hour later we headed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unknown. The Venusian boat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were ill-at-ease now and jabbered</seg><seg type="columnLine">among themselves constantly. We camped</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night on a miserable little island where</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects swarmed about us in hordes. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">next day an indefinable wave of weariness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and despondency beset our entire party.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I caught myself musing over the futility</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the venture. Only the pleadings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grannie Annie kept me from turning back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the morrow I realized the truth in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning, that all of us had been exposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the insidious radiations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After that I lost track of time. Day</seg><seg type="columnLine">after day of incessant rain ... of steam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing swamp. . . . But at length we reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">firm ground and began our advance on</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Karn who first sighted the ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Striding in the lead, he suddenly halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the top of a hill and leveled his arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him. There it lay, a huge cigar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped vessel of blackened arelium steel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half buried in the swamp soil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's that thing on top?" Karn de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded, puzzled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A rectangular metal envelope had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">constructed over the stem quarters of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. Above this structure were three tall</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">masts. And suspended between them was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a network of copper wire studded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">white insulators.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grannie gazed a long moment through</seg><seg type="columnLine">binoculars. "Billy-boy, take three Venus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ians and head across the knoll," she or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered. "Ezra and I will circle in from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">west. Fire a.gun if you strike trouble."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But we found no trouble. The scene be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore us lay steeped in silence. Moments</seg><seg type="columnLine">later our two parties converged at the base</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A metal ladder extended from the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velope down the side of the vessel. Mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way we could see a circular hatch-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Up we go, Billy-boy." Heat gun in</seg><seg type="columnLine">readiness, Grannie Annie began to climb</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The silence remained absolute. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the door and pulled it open. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no sign of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Somebody's gone to a lot of trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">here," Ezra Kam observed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somebody had. Before us stretched a</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow corridor, flanked on the left side by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wall of impenetrable stepto glass. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor was bare of furnishings. But be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the glass, revealed to us in mocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">clarity, was a high panel, studded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dials and gauges. Even as we looked, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see liquid pulse in glass tubes, indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cator needles swing slowly to and fro.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grannie nodded. "Some kind of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadcasting unit. The Green Flames in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lower hold are probably exposed to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">t hoi pane plate and their radiations stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">lip by an electro-phosicalic process."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Karn raised the butt of his pistol and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought it crashing against the glass wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His arm jumped in recoil, but the glass re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained intact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll never do it that way," Grannie</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Nothing short of an atomic blast</seg><seg type="columnLine">will shatter that wall. It explains why there</seg><seg type="columnLine">are no guards here. The mechanism is en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely self-operating. Let's see if the Green</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flames are more accessible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the lower hold disappointment again</seg><seg type="columnLine">confronted us. Visible in the feeble shafts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of daylight that filtered through cracks in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vessel's hull were tiers of rectangular</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingots of green iridescent ore. Suspended</seg><seg type="columnLine">by insulators from the ceiling over them</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a thick metal plate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">42	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But between was a barrier. A wall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">impenetrable stepto glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grannie stamped her foot. "It's mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dening," she said. "Here we are at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crux of the whole matter, and we're power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less to make a single move."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OUTSIDE the day was beginning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wane. The Venusians, apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">unawed by the presence of the space ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had already started a fire and erected the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tents. We left the vessel to find a spell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">brooding desolation heavy over the impro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vised camp. And the evening meal this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time was a gloomy affair. When it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished, Ezra Karn lit his pipe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">switched on the portable visi set. A mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment later the silence of the march was</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken by the opening fanfare of the Doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor Universe program. '</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great stuff," Karn commented.

Grannie paced ten yards off</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the gathering darkness and returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly. "Billy-boy, you were right. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man behind this is Doctor Universe. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was he who stole my manuscript and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vised a method to amplify the radiations</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Green Flames in the freighter's hold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He lit on a sure-fire plan to broadcast</seg><seg type="columnLine">those radiations in such a way that millions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of persons would be exposed to them simul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taneously.

Oh, don't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, Billy-boy? The Green Flames' radia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions spell doom to freedom, individual lib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sat there stupidly, wondering if this</seg><seg type="columnLine">all were some wild dream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, as I looked across at Gran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nie Annie, the vague light over the tents</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to shift a little, as if one layer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the atmosphere had dropped away to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">replaced by another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There it was again, a definite movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air. Somehow I got the impression</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was looking around that space rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than through it. And simultaneously Ezra</seg><seg type="columnLine">Karn uttered a howl of pain. An instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">later the old prospector was rolling over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and over, threshing his arms wildly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An invisible sledge hammer descended</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my shoulder. The blow was followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by another and another. Heavy unseen</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands held me down.

Ezra Karn yelled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We've got to make 'em laugh. Our only</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape is to make 'em laugh!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He struggled to his feet and began leap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing wildly around the camp fire. Abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">his foot caught on a log protruding from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire; he tripped and fell headlong into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mass of hot coals and ashes. Like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumping jack he was on his feet again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clawing dirt and soot from his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out of the empty space about us there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a sudden hush. The unseen blows</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased in mid-career. And then the si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence was rent by wild laughter. Peal</seg><seg type="columnLine">after peal of mirthful yells pounded against</seg><seg type="columnLine">our ears. For many moments it continued;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then it died away, and everything was</seg><seg type="columnLine">peaceful once more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grannie Annie picked herself up slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That was close," she said. "I wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to go through that again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ezra Karn nursed an ugly welt under</seg><seg type="columnLine">one eye.

That meant some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. A thermal, a river of wind--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">downdraft, perhaps. Sometimes these eon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">old canyons held lost rivers, changing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifting their courses as Mars crumbled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and such watercourses might be traced by</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well--be knew Klanvahr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A half mile farther he found the arroyo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not too deep--fifty feet or less, with jagged</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls easy to descend. He could hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trickle of water, though he could not see</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and his thirst became overpowering. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">caution made him clamber down the preci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pice warily. He did not drink till he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reconnoitered and made sure that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And that made Dantan's thin lips curl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Safety for a man hunted by the Redhelms ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thought was sufficiently absurd. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would die--he must die; but he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean to die alone. This time perhaps they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had him, but the kill would not be easy nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">without cost. If he could find some weap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, some ambush--prepare some trap for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hunters--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There might be possibilities in this can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yon. The stream had only lately been di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verted into this channel; the signs of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were clear. Thoughtfully Dantan worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way upstream. He did not try to mask</seg><seg type="columnLine">his trail by water-tricks; the Redhelms</seg><seg type="columnLine">were too wise for that. No, there must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">some other answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A mile or so farther along he found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason for the diverted stream. Landslide.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where water had chuckled and rustled</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the left-hand branch before, now it</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the other route. Dantan followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry canyon, finding the going easier now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since Phobos had risen ... an Eye of Thar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Eyes of the god miss nothing. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">move across the world, and nothing can</seg><seg type="columnLine">hide from Thar, or from his destiny."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Dantan saw rounded metal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Washed clean by the water that had run</seg><seg type="columnLine">here lately, a corroded, curved surface rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">dome-shaped from the stream bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The presence of an artifact in this place</seg><seg type="columnLine">was curious enough. The people of Klan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vahr--the old race--had builded with some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">substance that had not survived; plastic or</seg><seg type="columnLine">something else that was not metal. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">this dome had the unmistakable dull sheen</seg><seg type="columnLine">of steel. It was an alloy, unusually strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">or it could never have lasted this long, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though protected by its covering of rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and earth. A little nerve began jumping in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dantan's cheek. He had paused briefly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but now he came forward and with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">booted foot kicked away some of the dirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the cryptic metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A curving line broke it. Scraping vigor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously, Dantan discovered that this marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outline of an oval door, horizontal, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a handle of some sort, though it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">caked and fixed in its socket with dirt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dantan's lips were very thin now, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes glittering and bright. An ambush--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon against the Redhelms--whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">might exist behind this lost door, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth investigating, especially for a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">demned man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With water from the brook and a sliver</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sharp stone, he pried and chiseled until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the handle was fairly free from its heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">crust. It was a hook, like a shepherd's</seg><seg type="columnLine">crook, protruding from a small bowl-shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">depression in the door. Dantan tested it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would not move in any direction. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">braced himself, legs straddled, body half</seg><seg type="columnLine">-doubled, and strained at the hook.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blood beat against the back of his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He heard drumming in his temples and</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightened suddenly, thinking it the foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps of Redhelms. Then, grinning sar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">donically, he bent to his work again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time the handle moved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beneath him the door slid down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung aside, and the darkness below gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">place to soft light. He saw a long tube</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretching down vertically, with pegs pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">truding from the metal walls at regular</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervals. It made a ladder. The bottom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shaft was thirty feet below'; its diam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eter was little more than the breadth of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">big man's shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE STOOD still for a moment, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, his mind almost swimming</seg><seg type="columnLine">with wonder and surmise. Old, very old</seg><seg type="columnLine">it must be, for the stream Had cut its own</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed out of the rock whose walls rose above</seg><seg type="columnLine">him now. Old--and yet these metal sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces gleamed as brightly as they must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleamed on the day they were put together</seg><seg type="columnLine">--for what purpose ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">48</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wind sighed again down the canyon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Dantan remembered the Redhelms on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his track. He looked around once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then lowered himself onto the ladder</seg><seg type="columnLine">of metal pegs, testing them doubtfully be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he let his full weight come down. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">held.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There might be danger down below;</seg><seg type="columnLine">there might not. There was certain danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming after him among the twisting can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yons. He reached up, investigated briefly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swung the door back into place. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a lock, he saw, and after a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered how to manipulate it. So far,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the results were satisfactory. He was tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porarily safe from the Redhelms, provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not suffocate. There was no air</seg><seg type="columnLine">intake here that he could see, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathed easily enough so far. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry about that when the need arose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There might be other tilings to worry about</seg><seg type="columnLine">before lack of air began to distress him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He descended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the bottom of the shaft was another</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. Its handle yielded with no resistance</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time, and Dantan stepped across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">threshold into a large, square underground</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber, lit with pale radiance that came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the floor itself, as though light had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been poured into the molten metal when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had first been made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The room--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Faintly he heard a distant humming, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the after-resonance of a bell, but it died</seg><seg type="columnLine">away almost instantly. The room was large,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and empty except for some sort of machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing against the farther wall. Dantan</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not a technician. He knew guns and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships; that was enough. But the smooth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleek functionalism of this machine gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him an almost sensuous feeling of pleasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How long had it been here? Who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">built it ? And for what purpose ? He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even guess. There was a great oval</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen on the wall above what seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a control board, and there were other, more</seg><seg type="columnLine">enigmatic devices.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the screen was black--dead black,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a darkness that ate up the light in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and gave back nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet there was something--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sanfel," a voice said. ''Sanfel. Coth</seg><seg type="columnLine">dr'gchang. Sanfel--sthan!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sanfel. . . Sanfel. .. have you returned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sanfel? Answer!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a woman's voice ... the voice of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman used to wielding power, quiet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow proud as the voice of Lucifer or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lilith might have been, and it spoke in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue that scarcely half a dozen living men</seg><seg type="columnLine">could understand. ... A whole great race</seg><seg type="columnLine">had spoken it once; only the shamans re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered now, and the shamans who knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">it were few. Dantan's godfather had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. And Dantan remembered the slur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring syllables of the rituals he had learned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">well enough to know what the proud, bodi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less voice was saying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The nape of his neck prickled. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something he could not understand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he did not like it. Like an animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">scenting danger he shrank into himself, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouching, but withdrawing, so that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller man seemed to stand there, ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">and waiting for the next move. Only his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were not motionless. They raked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room for the unseen speaker--for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon to use when the time came for</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His glance came back to the dark screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the machine. And the voice said</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, in the tongue of ancient,Klanvahr:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am not used to waiting, Sanfel! If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you hear me. speak. And speak quickly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the time of peril comes close now. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">Enemy is strong--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dantan said, "Can you hear me?" His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes did not move from the screen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out of that blackness the girl's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, after a pause. It was imperious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a little wary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are not Sanfel. Where is he?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who are you, Martian?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DANTAN let himself relax a little.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There would be a parley, at any rate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But after that--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Words in the familiar, remembered old</seg><seg type="columnLine">language came hesitantly to his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am no Martian. I am of Earth blood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I do not know this Sanfel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then how did you get into Sanfel's</seg><seg type="columnLine">place ?" The voice was haughty now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What are you doing there? Sanfel built</seg><seg type="columnLine">his laboratory in a secret place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was hidden well enough," Dantan</seg><seg type="columnLine">told her grimly. "Maybe for a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, or even ten thousand, for all I know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The door has been buried under a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is no water there. Sanfel's home</seg><seg type="columnLine">is on a mountain, and his laboratory is built</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE EYES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">underground." The voice rang like a bell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I think you lie. I think you are an ene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">my-- When I heard the signal summoning</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, I came swiftly, wondering why Sanfel</seg><seg type="columnLine">had delayed so long. I must find him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger. I must! I f you are no enemy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring me Sanfel!" This time there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something almost like panic in the voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	"If I could, I would," Dantan said. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's no one here except me." He hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated, wondering if the woman behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice could be--mad? Speaking from some</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious place beyond the screen, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">language dead a thousand years, calling</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a man who must be long-dead too, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">one could judge by the length of time this</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden room had lain buried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said after a moment, "This place has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been buried for a long time. And--no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">has spoken the tongue of Klanvahr for</seg><seg type="columnLine">many centuries. If that was your Sanfel's</seg><seg type="columnLine">language--" But he could not go on with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that thought. If Sanfel had spoken Klan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vahr then he must have died long ago. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speaker beyond the screen--she who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had known Sanfel, yet spoke in a young,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet, light voice that Dantan was begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning to think sounded familiar. . . . He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered if he could be mad too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was silence from the screen. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">many seconds the voice spoke again, sadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with an undernote of terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I had not realized," it said, "that even</seg><seg type="columnLine">time might be so different between Sanfel's</seg><seg type="columnLine">world and mine. The space-time continua</seg><seg type="columnLine">--yes, a day in my world might well be an</seg><seg type="columnLine">age in yours. Time is elastic. In Zha I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had thought a few dozen--" she used a</seg><seg type="columnLine">term Dantan did not understand, "--had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed. But on Mars--centuries?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Tens of centuries," agreed Dantan, star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hard at the screen. "If Sanfel lived in</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Klanvahr his people are scarcely a</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory now. And Mars is dying. You--</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're speaking from another world?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"From another universe, yes. A very</seg><seg type="columnLine">different universe from yours. It was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">through Sanfel that I had made contact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until now-- What is your name?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dantan. Samuel Dantan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a Martian name. You are from--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth, you say? What is that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Another planet. Nearer the sun than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have no planets and no suns in Zha.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">4--Planet Stories--Fall</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF THAR	49</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">This is a different universe indeed. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">different I find it hard to imagine what</seg><seg type="columnLine">your world must be like." The voice died.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND IT WAS a voice he knew. Dantan</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nearly sure of that now, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainty frightened him. When a man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Martian desert begins to see or hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossibilities, he has reason to be fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened. As the silence prolonged itself he</seg><seg type="columnLine">began almost to hope that the voice--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">implausibly familiar voice--had been only</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination. Hesitantly he said, "Are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">still there?" and was a little relieved, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, to hear her say,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I am here. I was thinking. . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">I need help. I need it desperately. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder--has S'anfel's laboratory changed?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Does the machine still stand ? But it must,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or I could not speak to you now. If the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other things work, there n:ay be chance. . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">Listen." Her voice grew urgent. "I may</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a use for you. Do you see a lever,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarlet, marked with the Klanvahr symbol</seg><seg type="columnLine">for 'sight'?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see it," Dantan said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Push it forward. There is no harm in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, if you are careful. We can see each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other--that is all. But do not touch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lever with the 'door' symbol on it. Be</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain of that.. . Wait!" Sudden urgency</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes?" Dantan had not moved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am forgetting. There is danger if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are not protected from--from certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibration that you might see here. This is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">different universe, and your Martian physi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal laws do not hold good between our</seg><seg type="columnLine">worlds. Vibration . . . light . . . other</seg><seg type="columnLine">things might harm you. There should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">armor in Sanfel's laboratory. Find it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dantan glanced around. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabinet in one corner. He went over to it</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, his eyes wary. He had no inten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of relaxing vigilance here simply be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause that voice sounded familiar. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inside the cabinet hung a suit of some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing like space armor, more flexible and</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin tight than any he had ever seen, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a transparent helmet through which</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision seemed oddly distorted. He got-into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the suit carefully, pulling up the rich shin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing folds over his body, thinking strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">how long time had stood still in this small</seg><seg type="columnLine">room since the last time a man had worn</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. The whole room looked slightly differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">50	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ent when he set the helmet into place. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be polarized, he decided, though that</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone could not account for the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimming and warping of vision that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All ready," he said after a moment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then throw the switch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With his hand upon it Dantan hesitated</seg><seg type="columnLine">for one last instant of wariness. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepping into unknown territory now, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him the unknown meant the perilous.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His mind went back briefly to the Redhelms</seg><seg type="columnLine">scouring the canyons above for him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">quieted his uneasy mind with the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there might be some weapon in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'orld of the voice which he could turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">against them later. Certainly, without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon, he had little to lose. But he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that weapon or no weapon, danger or not,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he must see the face behind that sweet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar, imperious voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pressed the lever forward. It hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated, the weight of milleniums behind its</seg><seg type="columnLine">inertia. Then, groaning a little in its socket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it moved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Across the screen above it a blaze of</seg><seg type="columnLine">color raged like a sudden shining deluge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blinded by the glare, Dantan leaped back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swung an arm across his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he looked again the colors had</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared. Blinking, he stared--and forgot</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look away. For the screen was a win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow now, with the world of Zha behind it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">. . . And in the center of that window--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl. He looked once at her, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed his eyes. He had felt his heart move,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a nerve jumped in his lean cheek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He whispered a name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Impassively the girl looked down at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the screen. There was no change, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of recognition upon that familiar, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved face. The face of the girl who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">died at the Redhelm hands, long ago, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortress of Klanvahr. . . . For her sake he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had hunted the Redhelms all these danger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous years. For her sake he had taken to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spaceways and the outlaw life. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, for her sake the Redhelms hunted him</seg><seg type="columnLine">now through the canyons overhead. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">here in the screen, she did not know him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew that this was not possible. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">outrageous trick of vision made the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the slender body of a woman from</seg><seg type="columnLine">another universe seem the counterpart of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that remembered woman. But he knew it</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be an illusion, for in a world as differ-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ent as Zha surely there could be no human</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures at all, certainly no human who</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore the same face as the girl he remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASIDE from the girl herself, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to see. The screen was blank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except for vague shapes--outlines-- The</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet, he thought, filtered out more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. He sensed, somehow, that beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">her stretched the world of Zha, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see nothing except the shifting, ever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">changing colors of the background.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked down at him without expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. Obviously the sight of him had wak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened in her no such deep-reaching echoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of emotion as her face woke in him. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, her voice almost unbearably familiar;</seg><seg type="columnLine">a voice sounding from the silence of death</seg><seg type="columnLine">over many chilly years,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Dantan.

Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Sanfel has failed me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--I'd help you if I could." He said it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with difficulty, trying to force the remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brance upon himself that this was a stran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger. . . . "Tell me what's wrong."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shrugged with a poignantly familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have an Enemy. One of a lower race.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he--it--there is no word!--has cut me</seg><seg type="columnLine">off from my people here in a part of Zha</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is--well, dangerous--I can't describe</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you the conditions here. We have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">common terms to use in speaking of them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But there is great danger, and the Enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">is coming closer--and I am alone. If there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were another of my people here to divide</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peril I think I could destroy him.

It--it pulls. It destroys, in a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can find no word to say. I had hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Sanfel something to divert him until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could be killed. I told him how to forge</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a weapon, but--time would not let him</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it. The teeth of time ground him into</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust, as my Enemy's weapon will grind me</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shrugged again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I could get you a gun," Dantan said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"A force-ray--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are they?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He described the weapons of his day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Quiana's smile was a little scornful</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he finished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We of Zha have passed beyond the use</seg><seg type="columnLine">of missile weapons--even such missiles as</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullets or rays.

It was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most intolerable, this facing her again in</seg><seg type="columnLine">need, and again helpless, and himself with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out power to aid. It had been bad enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">that first time, to learn long afterward that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had died at enemy hands while he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too far away to protect her.

She smiled a little.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I know you would help me if you could,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dantan. But there is nothing to be done</seg><seg type="columnLine">now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll come in," he said doggedly.

Even now</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's danger. He was very close when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	heard that signal. This is his territory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When I heard the bell and thought Sanfel</seg><seg type="columnLine">had returned with a weapon for me, I dared</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly in coming here." Her voice died</seg><seg type="columnLine">away; a withdrawn look veiled her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a long silence she said, "The Ene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">my is coming. Turn off the screen, Dantan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And goodbye."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he said. "Wait!" But she shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head and turned away from him, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin robe swirling, and moved off like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">52	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pale shadow into the dim, shadowless emp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiness of the background. He stood watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing helplessly, feeling all the old despair</seg><seg type="columnLine">wash over him a second time as the girl he</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved went alone into danger he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">share. Sometimes as she moved away she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was eclipsed by objects he could not see--</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, he thought, or rocks, that did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">impinge upon his eyes' through the protec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive helmet. A strange world indeed Zha</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be, whose very rocks and trees were</seg><seg type="columnLine">too alien for human eyes to look upon in</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety. . . . Only Quiana grew smaller and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller upon the screen, and it seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dantan as though a cord stretched between</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, pulling thinner and thinner as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">receded into danger and distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was unbearable to think that the cord</seg><seg type="columnLine">might break--break a second time. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Far away something moved in the cloudy</seg><seg type="columnLine">world of Zha. Tiny in the distance though</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was, it was unmistakably not human.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dantan lost sight of Quiana. Had she</seg><seg type="columnLine">found some hiding place behind some un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">imaginable outcropping of Zha's terrain?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Enemy came forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was huge and scaled and terrible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">human, but not a human; tailed, but no</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast; intelligent, but diabolic. He never</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw it too clearly, and he was grateful to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his helmet for that. The polarized glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to translate a little, as well as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">blot out. He felt sure that this creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he saw--or almost saw--did not look</seg><seg type="columnLine">precisely as it seemed to him upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen. Yet it was easy to believe that such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a being had sprung from the alien soil of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zha. There was nothing remotely like it on</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of the worlds he knew. And it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hateful. Every line of it made his hackles</seg><seg type="columnLine">bristle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It carried a coil of brightly colored tub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing slung over one grotesque shoulder, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its monstrous head swung from side to side</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it paced forward into the screen like</seg><seg type="columnLine">some strange and terrible mechanical toy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It made no sound, and its progress was</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible in its sheer relentless monotony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ABRUPTLY it paused. He thought it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sensed the girl's presence, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where in hiding. It reached for the coil of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubing with one malformed--hand?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quiana," it said--its voice as gentle as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a child's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Silence. Dantan's breathing was loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the emptiness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quiana?" The tone was querulous now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quiana," the monster crooned, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung about with sudden, unexpected agil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity. Moving with smooth speed, it van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished into the clouds of the background, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl had vanished. For an eternity</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dantan watched colored emptiness, trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep himself from trembling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he heard the voice again, gentle no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer, but ringing like a bell with terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumph, "Quiana!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And out of the swirling clouds he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quiana break, despair upon her face, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer garments streaming behind her. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">her came the Enemy. It had unslung the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube it wore over its shoulder, and as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted the weapon Quiana swerved desper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately aside. Then from the coil of tubing</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind lightning ravened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shattering the patternless obscurity, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blaze of its color burst out, catching Qui-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ana in a cone of expanding, shifting bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liance. And the despair in her eyes was</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly more than Dantan could endure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His hand struck out at the lever marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">"door"; he swung it far over and the veil</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had masked the screen was gone. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaulted up over its low threshold, not see-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing anything but the face and the terror of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quiana. But it was not Quiana's name he</seg><seg type="columnLine">called as he leaped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lunged through the Door onto soft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yielding substance that was unlike anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had ever felt underfoot before. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely knew it. He flung himself for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, fists clenched, ready to drive futile</seg><seg type="columnLine">blows into the monstrous mask of the Ene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">my. It loomed over him like a tower, tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous, scarcely seen through the shelter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his helmet--and then the glare of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light-cone caught him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was tangible light. It flung him back</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a piledriver punch that knocked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath from his body. And the blow was</seg><seg type="columnLine">psychic as well as physical. Shaking and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeling from the shock, Dantan shut his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and fought forward, as though against</seg><seg type="columnLine">a steady current too strong to breast very</seg><seg type="columnLine">long. He felt Quiana beside him, caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the same dreadful stream. And beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the source of the light the Enemy stood up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in stark, inhuman silhouette.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He never saw Quiana's world. The light</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too blinding. And yet, in a subtle</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE EYES OF THAR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">53</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sense, it was not blinding to the eyes, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the mind. Nor was it light, Dantan</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, with some sane part of his mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Too late he remembered Quiana's warning</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the world of Zha was not Mars or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth, that in Zha even light was differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cold and heat mingled, indescribably be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildering, shook him hard. And beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">these were--other things. The light from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Enemy's weapon was not bom in Dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tan's universe, and it had properties that</seg><seg type="columnLine">light should not have. He felt bare, emp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied, a hollow shell through which radiance</seg><seg type="columnLine">streamed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For suddenly, every cell of his body was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an eye. The glaring brilliance, the intoler-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able vision beat at the foundations of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanity. Through him the glow went pour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, washing him, nerves, bone, flesh, brain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in floods of color that were not color, sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was not sound, vibration that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">spawned in the shaking hells of worlds be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond imagination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It inundated him like a tide, and for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, long, timeless while he stood helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its surge, moving within his body and</seg><seg type="columnLine">without it, and within his mind and soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well. The color of stars thundered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brain. The crawling foulness of un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">speakable hues writhed along his nerves so</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrously that he felt he could never</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleanse himself of that obscenity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And nothing else existed--only the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was not light, but blasphemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then it began to ebb . . . faded . . . grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">lesser and lesser, until-- Beside him he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see Quiana now. She was no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbling in the cone of light, no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuddering and wavering in its violence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but standing erect and facing the Enemy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from her eyes--something--poured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Steadily the cone of brilliance waned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But still its glittering, shining foulness</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured through Dantan. He felt himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakening, his senses fading, as the tide of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark horror mounted through his brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And covered him up with its blanketing</seg><seg type="columnLine">immensity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE WAS back in the laboratory, lean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing against the wall and breathing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep, shuddering draughts. He did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember stumbling through the Door</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, but he was no longer in Zha. Quiana</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood beside him, here upon the Martian</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">soil of the laboratory. She was watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with a strange, quizzical look in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes as he slowly fought back to normal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heart quieting by degrees, his breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">becoming evener. He felt drained, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausted, his emotions cleansed and purified</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though by baths of flame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently he reached for the clasp that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened his clumsy armor. Quiana put</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a quick hand, shaking her head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," she said, and then stared at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">again for a long moment without speaking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally, "I had not known--I did not think</seg><seg type="columnLine">this could be done. Another of my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">race--yes. But you, from Mars--I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have believed that you could stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the Enemy for a moment, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">with your armor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm from Earth, not Mars. And I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't stand long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Long enough," She smiled faintly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You see now what happened? We of Zha</seg><seg type="columnLine">can destroy without weapons, using only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power inherent in our bodies.

They thought,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, they had caught all of them that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on his suit, but now it was clear they</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't. Some of them must have gotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">away and found the ship. They would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">made straight for it, of course, because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the alloys that were in it.

A split second later</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ball was over the goal and the ship was</seg><seg type="columnLine">curving back, repulsor beam snapped off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's the bugs!"

To do that would be to infest the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other ships parked there, spread the bugs</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout the solar system. And those</seg><seg type="columnLine">bugs definitely were something the solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">system cold get along without.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ship shuddered and twisted, weav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing its way through the pack of players.</seg><seg type="columnLine">More plates ripped loose.

He jumped to the panel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned a dial, lighting the blue filter to scan</seg><seg type="columnLine">the void outside. The magnetic detector</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned of something outside--a patrol</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruiser!</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CITADEL OF DEATH	77</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NORMAN fingered his triggers instinc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively, then left the dead guns in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage as black as the Venusian's hair. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">only thing he could shoot at the patrol</seg><seg type="columnLine">were his hull fire extinguishers. He clicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the rear view screen--he had to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the patrol first now--outmaneuver them</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow. But behind him was only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness of space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The raven-haired woman's sparkling eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew nervous. "If those fools shoot--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">She lit a cigarette, exhaling quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bell rang frantically. Something</seg><seg type="columnLine">was coming at them, fast. He traversed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screen again but around them was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible thing. The sun was too bright.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was only one thing to do. His hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell on the wheel, twirled it around to</seg><seg type="columnLine">swoop off course--try to dodge the patrol,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherever they were--take a chance on</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting his way back against Sun drag.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A flash of red light burst into the room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pilot room keeled over. He fell to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room's glass ceiling that had suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">become the floor. The women landed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a perfumed heap on top of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood on the slick curve of glass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyeing the cut-off on the control panel</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was now overhead. A patrol boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come in from the Sun's blind spot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They'd chanced a long shot. Jammed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhaust tube and thrown the stabilizer off</seg><seg type="columnLine">balance. Seconds off course.

Min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes--the Sun was an inexorable pull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Madly, Norman jumped to reach the cut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">off--to cut the unbalanced rocket blast that</seg><seg type="columnLine">held the ship on its back in the increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of their dive. Out of control, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were streaking toward the Sun under full</seg><seg type="columnLine">power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The diameter of the Sun is 108 times</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of Earth. Its mass is 324,000 times</seg><seg type="columnLine">as great. Mathematics could calculate</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily the speed of falling into that molten</seg><seg type="columnLine">inferno but Norman knew only the thun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering of his heart in that silent room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He jumped three times for the cut-off lever</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and fell back. Then with fear like steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">coils in his legs, he floundered up once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, leaped from the glass and the tips</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his fingers brought down the clutch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The room slowly moved out from under</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, sliding the girls across the smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass. He was at the controls before the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ship righted itself. Sweeping the panel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he jerked every rocket into reverse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And nothing happened. The power of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his blasts was nothing against the direct</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull of the Sun, this close. The ship hurtled</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward its fiery mass at terrific speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Among the battery of instruments on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the panel was a small stratometer, cali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brated in seconds. Norman saw the pointer</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving with the speed of the second hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a watch. With each jump of the pointer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they fell thousands of miles. Despite the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thermo-glass, heat grew in the room like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">live thing. In less than three minutes, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized, the ship would begin to melt. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang from the controls, bent over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long coffin-shaped box beside the galley</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. His fingers were frantic thumbs as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he set the dials. It wasn't merely a test</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gravitation counteractive now. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism had to work or they would boil</seg><seg type="columnLine">like lobsters in the steam of the very air</seg><seg type="columnLine">they breathed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorothy Gray stood sensibly out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, watching his frenzied hands switch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the delicate instrument.

"Ordering his men to fire when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew I was in here--Hey!" she de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded. "Why's it getting so hot in here ?''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorothy pointed toward the instrument</seg><seg type="columnLine">panel. "See that little clock," she said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">oddly observant for one of her few years.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's a stratometer. My dad's shown 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me on the big passenger lines. It says</seg><seg type="columnLine">we're falling mighty fast. It's getting hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">in here because we're falling into the Sun."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seconds thundered by as Norman</seg><seg type="columnLine">twirled the rheostat knobs in the counter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">active, fighting to bring the delicate focus</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its power into play against the dread</seg><seg type="columnLine">suction that was dragging them down. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thermo-glass was jet black now against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid heat outside. With apparently a know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hand, Dorothy set the air conditioning</seg><seg type="columnLine">unit up to maximum as drops of moisture</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed on the ceiling and dampened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot room like hot dew. The thermo-glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to bulge slightly at its invisible seams,</seg><seg type="columnLine">first in thin ridges around the ceiling, jut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting out more and more as the mad heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased. Protection against the extremes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of temperature in space, it was constructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow these lines of expansion. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">for how long?</seg><seg type="columnLine">78	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keren screamed, razor-edged above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric tension in the room. "Give me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">parasuit!" she cried. "Get me out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">here!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norman's fingers played the rheostats</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a piano. Suddenly an electric eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinked red as the counteractive fell into</seg><seg type="columnLine">focus on the true gravity force sector of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sun. As he leaped to the controls, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye caught a glimpse of the stratometer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">small death-white face.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel blistered his fingers, but he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with will-screaming slowness, ignoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keren's clawing hands.

He rubbed his sweat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blackness of the glass was fading</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly, the seam bulges sinking back with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the contraction. Without the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremor, the counteractive had stopped their</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunge into the Sun, and the reverse rock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ets had taken over.

"We're going to crash!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the woman fought like a panther, black</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes blazing.

Cursing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venusian woman, he reached for his pis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tol. He'd shoot it out point blank from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. Then as his hand moved toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the panel switch to open the door he barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the needle enter his back.

"I don't know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you stuck me with," he told Keren, "but if</seg><seg type="columnLine">I go out, you are going to be tied up till</seg><seg type="columnLine">I come to."

"If I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want you to do a lot of talking first, I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">tie this rope around your neck instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your hands."

Push-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing aside the space units--life preservers--</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging on their customary hooks, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapped the tank with his knuckles.

Shaking his head, he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on into the pilot room where his eyes im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately fell on a small black notebook</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying on the control panel.

"Point your gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">at 'em to hush," he said. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned back, wrinkling her freckled nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went outside again as he returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his perusal of the symbols.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were a description of the elements</seg><seg type="columnLine">in something, in a very unusual combina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.

Something deep in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows of his mind was trying to speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">--not about the symbols--about something</seg><seg type="columnLine">else. Something he had done? Something</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had seen? Anyhow, Norman had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">in enough bad spots to pay attention when</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ghostly feeling sounded its alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Closing the notebook, he stepped across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pilot room and walked into the cabin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a pistol's point blank explosion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The burst of flame seared Norman's left</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. In the same second, as his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up to grab the gun, he realized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossibility of getting it in time. Swart</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too close. His hand dropped to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">blistered side. Swart had him between</seg><seg type="columnLine">death and surrender.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're lucky," Swart's mustache wig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled as he'spoke. "Get outside."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dazed at the unbelievably swift change</seg><seg type="columnLine">of events, Norman obeyed. And as his foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit the first step he knew what had called</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from the notebook.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorothy--was no longer Dorothy . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">82	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE HAD been changed when she en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered the ship a moment ago but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't realized it.

Just out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pig-tails and giggles--Dorothy Gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">was suddenly a woman. Her freckles were</seg><seg type="columnLine">weirdly absent now, her blond hair was</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer, her arms were more full--her legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">--her--! Her white coveralls had shrunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">on what was now a slim, lithe figure. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was really Dorothy--the same pert face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same kitten-like eyes, wide with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishment as great as his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sade's laughter broke Norman's blank</seg><seg type="columnLine">stare. "Next time you tie up a man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an artificial arm make sure it isn't electric.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's easy to cause a short circuit when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're soaked with fire extinguisher fluid</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when they short circuit they burn</seg><seg type="columnLine">through rope very easily."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Norman barely heard him, barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Swart untying the patrolmen whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">swollen eyes were beginning to see again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was remembering! "Complete life cycle</seg><seg type="columnLine">accelerated. One year equals approximately</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty minutes'* He offered no resistance</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Swart jerked the notebook from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. As the grass grew, so had Dorothy</seg><seg type="columnLine">--so had Johnny, to the horrible near-com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletion of his life cycle. But why wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sade, Keren, the others affected? Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">not himself ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's get in the ship," Keren broke into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thoughts. "There's no sense wasting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best years of this girl's life out here."</seg><seg type="columnLine">With an unholy smile she walked up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps into the cruiser.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get in the ship, Norman," Sade said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling like a puddle of oil. "You've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lot more to see before we waste the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of your life."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inside the cruiser, Dorothy sank into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pillowed chair and jerked a small pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror before her blue eyes. She seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to decide whether to laugh or cry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sade, Keren and the patrolmen left for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pilot room, leaving Swart on guard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Immediately, the green foliage fell away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the windows as the ship climbed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were tears in Dorothy's eyes but</seg><seg type="columnLine">her newly red-bloomed lips were tight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was horror in this tiling that had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened, years of her life whisked away--she</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be eighteen now, and she had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiant loveliness of clear sunshine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Norman's thoughts dwelt little on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heart-quickening results of her sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">change. He pondered the change itself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again he calculated the time she had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposed to whatever grim atmosphere en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped Vulcan--she couldn't have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">out there more than a few minutes. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">in those few minutes she had raced through</seg><seg type="columnLine">two long years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why wasn't I affected?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swart sat across the cabin with his pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his lap, hungrily nursing a cigarette he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had bummed from Keren. "You were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship," he squinted his amusement</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a smoke ring. "She was on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground." He grinned, eyeing Dorothy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Shows up better on her too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So that was it--something in the dank</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil. But what about the others? He</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Swart, who only shook his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The boss'll tell you all you need to know."</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Norman knew there were many ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions yet unanswered. Johnny hadn't been</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to fall into a trap laid by nature alone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was something going on here, more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than he knew yet, and something told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was on the right track--that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vulcan's strange power that dealt both</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty and decay, there was power here that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might spye Johnny . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally Dorothy decided to laugh. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know what happened," she said, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice no longer a child's, "but there seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to do about it--except to start run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning around with an older crowd when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">get back home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If we get back home, Norman thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirthlessly. If he knew Sade, he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorothy were both in the same boat, a boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would not be long afloat. "I'm sorry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorothy," he said. "It's my fault you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">here."	•</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wrong," she shook her blonde head. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to come with you." He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, sensing for the first time that now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow, they were on a diffei.nt basis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorothy was no longer a child and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">girlish hero worship was apparently re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed by something more mature.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CITADEL OF DEATH	83</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt the cruiser nose down. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were landing again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norman reached up and yanked a space</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit from its wall hook, threw it to Dorothy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Put this on over your coveralls." As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked another suit down for himself, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught a glimpse of a jungle-walled clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with a peculiar shaped building at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of a small landing field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they slid to a quick stop, the port</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened and Sade and his little group ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared again. The* fat Mercurian laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he saw Norman and Dorothy buckling</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the stiff garments. He made no move</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stop them. "Keren tells me you're very</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested in our little world," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That tank along the wall there holds what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're looking for, but first we must show</seg><seg type="columnLine">you around."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Encircled by the four patrolmen, Nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man and Dorothy were hustled out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship and across the landing field. The odd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">light-house-like building stood at the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the field, a large windowless structure</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a conical tower on top. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">led to the building in silence, ushered into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge room and the door closed behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Venusian mahogany paneled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tapestry covered walls and heavy carved</seg><seg type="columnLine">furniture was scattered about the room's</seg><seg type="columnLine">creamy white floor. Sade opened a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">door at the side and motioned his prisoner-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guests in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I haven't time to talk now," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Here's something to entertain you until</seg><seg type="columnLine">I return." He flicked a button outside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, then closed the door, leaving them</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone in the small room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NORMAN glanced at Dorothy, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to examine the place as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">took off his helmet. The room was small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark paneled and windowless like the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside. A furry 2hak-skin rug covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black floor. He started to speak, but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">panel at the end of the room suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowed with the transparent clearness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a window. A television screen--what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sade up to!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Norman sucked in his breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his teeth as Dorothy clutched his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm. Not the withered creature of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospital but the tousle-headed guy he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown up with--Johnny's image appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the screen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny stood in what at first appeared</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a clearing in the jungle but as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked at some invisible obstacle, Norman</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized a wall of glass separated him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surrounding field outside. The scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sparkling clear, as if they were watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through a window Johnny's futile ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forts to scale the smooth wall. His path</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the enclosure proved it to be cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cular, about eight fefet in diameter. Nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man ground his teeth. So Johnny had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been Sade's prisoner!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny took off one of his metal-soled</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes and started hammering the fine glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if something whipped him into a frantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort to escape. Dorothy silent beside him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norman watched the black-haired boy rub</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes wearily as he pounded with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoe. How had Sade gotten this picture?</seg><seg type="columnLine">What was his purpose in showing it now?</seg><seg type="columnLine">The glass of Johnny's prison must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been superbly invisible but soft for slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ground a shallow niche at the base of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, a foothold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norman felt like yelling a cheer but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered an oath 3s he watched Johnny</seg><seg type="columnLine">grind out a higher foothold. Trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carve a niche higher still, his fingers stained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass red. Quickly the glass was drip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping with blood. "Look at his hands!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorothy whispered. In Johnny's efforts to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cling to the wall, the ground glass was eat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing away the tips of his fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Norman shuddered to see the gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">change creeping over Johnny's face. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore his eyes, Johnny's dark hair became</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaked with gray and his ashen face be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came furrowed with wrinkles. Horror-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridden years, swiftly heaped upon him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorothy covered her face with her hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Norman couldn't tear his eyes from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the luminous screen. The film had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut to speed it up. Johnny had hacked five</seg><seg type="columnLine">slits in the glass now. His fingers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumbs were ragged stumps as he hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the splintered glass, ten feet up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood-smeared wall. And in his terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascination, Norman saw that Johnny's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands healed almost as fast as they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom. As the dry flesh of age withered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, as he sacrificed his hands in a mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle to escape the invisible terror in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vulcan's sunlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norman slammed his fists against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked door. "Sade! You scum of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">universe!" But there was no answer as</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes were drawn back to the screen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">84	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">see Johnny's fingerless paws grasp the rim</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his prison. A wrinkled, animal-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, eyes yellowed and wild, he drew up</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gnarled legs and fell over the glass wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the gravel on the other side. Half</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawling, half running, he disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly into the trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As though a prolonged roar of sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">had suddenly ceased, the panel darkened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving only Dorothy's muffled sobs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But in Norman's brain was a numb hate</seg><seg type="columnLine">that froze his reason. He didn't hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door open behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Interesting, wasn't it?" It was Sade's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. "But in a moment an even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting experiment will take place in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my laboratory."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norman turned slowly. Swart and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two patrolmen stood with the fat man at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. Norman took one quick step</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward. His right hand shot out. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers sank like spikes into the flabby skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Sade's throat. Another split second</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Norman's fingers would have met be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the Mercurian's windpipe and ripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">it out, but in that split second the patrolmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on him. Then he was on the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting silently in the blackness of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fury. A heavy boot caught him behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left ear and the blackness engulfed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BATTERED and bruised, he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself on his feet when he came to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sade stood in the door, his good hand fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gering the blue welts on his throat. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt was in shreds, exposing the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">blob of flesh that was his body and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless sausage-end stump that was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I could get my hands on you--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norman whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You won't again," Sade said hoarsely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're in my hands now.

That you take me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you--alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norman hesitated three heart beats.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let's go," he said. He heard Dorothy</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasp behind him but he didn't even look</seg><seg type="columnLine">back as Keren opened the door, finger to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her lips, and led him out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Locking the door behind her, she led him</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a dim, white-floored corridor. Nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man walked carefully, the baggy suit rus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tling as he moved. Keren halted before a</seg><seg type="columnLine">door at the side of the passage. Glancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and down the vacant hall, she opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door quickly and went in. Norman</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The room was bare with another closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">door on the other side. "You don't need</seg><seg type="columnLine">that space suit," Keren ordered. "Take</seg><seg type="columnLine">it off." Norman peeled the suit off obedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently. It was no time for questions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"When I jabbed you with that hypo before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sade found' us, it immunized you.

"Sade's--John Gordon's cruiser is</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside where we left it, about a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards from his door. It's unguarded but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's a guard in the tower. He'll shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he sees you so you must get to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship quickly. The cruiser's guns are loaded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If you make it, take off and blast this</seg><seg type="columnLine">building. I'll run for the woods." Keren's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy-lashed eyes met his. "When they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are dead, Vulcan will be ours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norman smiled. "What if I don't come</seg><seg type="columnLine">back?

"If you don't come back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll kill the Earth girl inside." She threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">back her head, hair swirling at her pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CITADEL OF DEATH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">85</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">throat like the flow of black oil. "Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">kiss me--and go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a choice; Karen's life or Dorothy's.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If he got the ship and Keren ran for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods, his guns would have to find her</seg><seg type="columnLine">before they turned on the house. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could bargain with Sade by radio. "I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">owe you a thousand kisses," he said, opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door, and darted out into the sunlight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then it was raining red heat as liquid fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">spurted around his pounding legs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A bare twenty yards ahead, the cruiser</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited, glinting silver in the sun. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">pants leg caught fire and he could feel its</seg><seg type="columnLine">blistering heat, fanned by the wind, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaked across the gravel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he saw it too late. A sheen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">crimson in the air. Streaks of red, painted</seg><seg type="columnLine">on nothing. Johnny's blood! Flame from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guns behind him sizzled on the invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass as Norman, unable to check the piston</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of his legs, crashed into the invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of what had been Johnny's prison.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His forehead hit the glass with a hollow</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring. Clutching the wall with both hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he slid down to the gravel and into dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness for his second failure that afternoon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Roughly, they dragged him back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. But he wasn't out. Through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">searing pain in his head he had fought back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to consciousness as the patrolmen touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. His mind limped through the pain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to figure out what to do now as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged him into the big front room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped him on the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Imbeciles! Careless fools!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The voice opened Norman's eyes, ban-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished the throbbing in his head as he strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled to his feet. But the two patrolmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked his arms behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How did he get out!" The fat man</seg><seg type="columnLine">glared from Norman to the patrolmen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swart stood beside him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There were only two keys to that room,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swart suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sade's florid face paled, then his button</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes flickered with the cold cruelty of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild animal. "Find Keren," he said softly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bring her to my laboratory."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rick's eyes showed helpless fury as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms tightened in the patrolmen's grasp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Keren had nothing to do with it," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I picked the lock."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sade reached out and slapped his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeatedly with his open palm. Hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamped behind him, Norman took it, barely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling the stinging blows, their impact</seg><seg type="columnLine">light under the impact of what he saw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes! It's real!" Sade halted his slap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping and, laughing like a fiend, rolled up</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sleeves. He held his hands up close</seg><seg type="columnLine">before Norman's eyes. Norman shud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered, staring at Sade's right hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slightly smaller, ghastly white but firm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the stump of Sade's right arm had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been was now flesh. Blood coursed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bulging veins, a pale hand extended</seg><seg type="columnLine">pudgy fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SADE howled with laughter as Norman</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew back from the thing as from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snake. "It's real!" Sade shouted, glee-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully. "Flesh and blood! I have two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands now!" Exultantly, he held his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched fists before Norman's white face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"In these hands I shall hold the pulse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the universe, to let it throb or halt at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">will. I shall be neither king nor dictator--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shall be a god! The power of life and</seg><seg type="columnLine">death in the universe is mine!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lifting his gaze from the hands, Norman</seg><seg type="columnLine">met the fat man's eyes coldly. "How'd you</seg><seg type="columnLine">do this, Sade ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sade's laughter dwindled to a greasy</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile. "After seeing what the power of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vulcan did to your friend, perhaps it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitting that you should see this power in</seg><seg type="columnLine">reverse." He nodded at the patrolmen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bring him along."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In an arm-lock on both sides, Norman</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dragged down the same corridor where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had followed Keren in his futile at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt- to escape. They halted at a door</seg><seg type="columnLine">at its far end. Sade opened the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Norman was shoved in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The place was white-walled and bare,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a hospital room but without the usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">furniture. On a four-legged platform in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the room lay a large porcelain</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder, like a chamber used for sterilizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">surgical instruments, but the surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder was smooth, without gadgets, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a heavily bolted cap at one end. Sade</seg><seg type="columnLine">patted the cylinder as a sculptor might ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mire the work of his chisel. "This holds</seg><seg type="columnLine">what John Gordon sought and what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">seek now to save his life," he smirked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This container holds fluid from Vulcan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fountains of Youth!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Standing before the cylinder, Norman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind's eye searched the situation for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance of escape. Here was what he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">86	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">come so far to obtain and he was powerless</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take it. But perhaps it wasn't time;</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was much he needed to know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Vulcan's power is a radiation," Sade</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "but not from the Sun. It's a liquid</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the ground, like Earthian oil--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">radioactive element such as science has only</seg><seg type="columnLine">found traces of in the cosmic rays. More</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful than radium; it exudes an exciter</seg><seg type="columnLine">to growth--a living force."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How'd you discover it without being</seg><seg type="columnLine">affected by it?" Norman asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your friend Gordon was the guinea</seg><seg type="columnLine">pig," the Mercurian said. Norman kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">still. "After we took him and his cruiser</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he entered the Protection Zone, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">came here immediately. Working in space</seg><seg type="columnLine">suits until my technicians on Mercury dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered an immunization, we brought Vul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can's strange liquid in like an oil gusher.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The effect of the pure liquid is instantane-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous ; its effects on the surface of the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside are greatly diluted. While we built</seg><seg type="columnLine">this house round the well, we watched Vul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can's milder effects on your friend in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass cage."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norman's jaw paled, but he kept his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. "How did Johnny get off the planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">after he escaped ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fool!" Sade laughed. "He didn't escape.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We could stay and watch him every minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">--that's why we left the automatic camera</seg><seg type="columnLine">to record his reactions. He did contrive</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get out of the cage but when wre found</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in the jungle we simply took him off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet and dropped him in space in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">life boat where he'd be picked up." Sade</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed again. "Did you think I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know he built two ships with counterac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tives! John Gordon's return was merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">a message to' you--to come here in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">other ship. Now wre have the only counter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">actives in existence. Vulcan is an utterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">impregnable fortress. No army in the uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse can interrupt my plans."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norman realized that everything Sade</seg><seg type="columnLine">said was true. No power could approach</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vulcan without a counteractive. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">are your plans, Sade?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fat man held up his new right arm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his small eyes glowing. "My technicians</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtained for me the hand-bud of an unborn</seg><seg type="columnLine">child. It was embedded in the stump of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my right arm." He stared at his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched its white fingers, his thick lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling. "With but a brief exposure of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">my arm to a spray of Vulcan's liquid in</seg><seg type="columnLine">full strength, I grew the hand of a thirty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">year-old man!" He banged the cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his fist. "What would happen if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprayed this life-death fluid in a city street!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It can be placed in a shell and fired from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gun. I have here a Force that can cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most horrible of wounds--quick decay.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It can utterly destroy or immediately heal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How I use this power depends upon how</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly the governments of the universe</seg><seg type="columnLine">submit to my wishes in a new stellar order."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Norman had a question stronger</seg><seg type="columnLine">than his hopelessness at what he'd just</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard. "Could this liquid help John Gor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead of replying, Sade smiled. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped over to one of the room's blank</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls and pressed a small button. A wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">panel slid back revealing several tiers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wire cages containing monkeys, rabbits,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and white rats. Sade scooped a plump slick</seg><seg type="columnLine">rat out of its cage and and closed the panel</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Walking back to the cylinder, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">slapped the helpless creature's head against</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wrist and stunned it. Then, drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flat shelf from the cylinder's platform,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he dropped the unconscious rat on it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw the heavy bolts on the cylinder's cap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">INSIDE the thick-walled container, Nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man discovered, were neatly coiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes hanging on pegs. Sade grabbed one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the small hoses, pulled it out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeezed a button on the little nozzle. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine, blood-red spray hissed from the nozzle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he directed the red mist upon the limp</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of the white rat. The damp liquid</seg><seg type="columnLine">had barely touched the rat's fur when in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly its small face wrinkled, its fur</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew coarse and thin and it assumed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of a very old animal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still smiling, Sade glanced at Norman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled gaze, then shut off the hose, stuck</seg><seg type="columnLine">it back in the cylinder and drew out an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. The spray that dampened the rat</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time was light pink. The rat's coarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat thickened, its sides swelled before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norman's eyes and youth was born anew</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the little animal's very brain as it leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its feet and scurried around the shelf</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all the energy of fresh strength.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's like many poisons," Sade said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Full strength, its effect is death. Greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">diluted--with mere water--its miracles</seg><seg type="columnLine">make it an elixir supreme. . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CITADEL OF DEATH	87</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door opened to Keren, followed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorothy and Swart. Keren's poise little</seg><seg type="columnLine">hinted she'd plotted Sade's death less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour ago. Dorothy had removed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">space suit; her eyes were red from crying.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keren took a cigarette from her loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">blouse. "You sent for me, Sade?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mercurian's eyes were like a rattle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">snake's as he held out his two hands for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to see. "I have these now," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly. "Soon I shall have every world at</seg><seg type="columnLine">my command. Will you marry me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dark-haired woman lit her cigarette</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly, her hand steady. "Yes," she an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered simply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sade laughed. "You say yes now be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause your life is at stake--because you</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to aid the Earthman.

You will lose--your beauty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Get a rope, Swart."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keren flicked her cigarette into Sade's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. Quick as a whip, her hand entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throat of her blouse. Norman saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glint of naked metal flash in an arc</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Sade's chest. Dorothy gasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The silver dagger sank into Sade's chest</seg><seg type="columnLine">just over his heart. The fat man staggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. But before he could fall, Swart acted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as quick as a ferret, clipped Keren's chin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as she crumpled silently to the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he caught the gasping Mercurian and eased</seg><seg type="columnLine">him down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From Sade's chest blood spurted higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the dagger's hilt as Swart yanked one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hoses from the cylinder and directed</seg><seg type="columnLine">its crimson spray on Sade's wound.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slowly, Swart drew out the dagger's sticky</seg><seg type="columnLine">blade in the spray. When the dagger was</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of Sade's chest there was no visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of a wound. Sade opened his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked up at them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What shall I do with her?" Swart said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sade got to his feet. He stood there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">panting a moment. "The rope," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swart pushed a wall button, extracted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of cord from a panel compartment</seg><seg type="columnLine">and returned. "Tie her to the cylinder,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sade hissed, "and tie the nozzle of the hose</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her hair."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment, the unconscious Keren was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging by her backward-bent arms from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylinder. The cord was tight from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her wrists, around the cylinder and under</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her slim ankles. In her hair was fixed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the slowly oozing hose. A rivulet of red</seg><seg type="columnLine">trickled down her smooth cheek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What about these two?" Swart said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">motioning toward Norman and Dorothy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "While we go to repair the new counter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">active ship which Mr. Norman so kindly</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought us," Sade said, "we can leave him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his girl in the glass cage."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they were marched across the field,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norman remembered Johnny's face on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospital pillow--tragic, old. Now, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green beauty of this time-thundering world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this same fate reached for them as it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">caressing Keren's cheek in the white-walled</seg><seg type="columnLine">room in the tower. Norman put his arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">around Dorothy's shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She drew away. "You deserted me for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keren once. Worry about her now, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swart grinned. "You can argue that out</seg><seg type="columnLine">while you grow old together," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The patrolman who had come out with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them picked up a metal ladder beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible wall and leaned it against the rim</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the glass. Then, smiling, he walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and grabbed the collar of Dorothy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">coveralls. "We sealed up the chinks to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep 'em from pulling the same trick Gor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don did but hadn't we better strip 'em to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make sure?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norman's fists tightened but he felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrel of Swart's pistol dig into his side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, on a quick thought, he drew a half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty pack of cigarettes from his pocket.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Leave her alone, Swart. We haven't any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to escape with. Take these cigarettes</seg><seg type="columnLine">for our clothes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dark man's hand snatched them</seg><seg type="columnLine">greedily. "I don't know why I don't take</seg><seg type="columnLine">both." But he stepped away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladder and waved his pistol at them. "All</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. Get in there. In ten seconds I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NORMAN followed Dorothy up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rungs of the ladder, climbed around</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and--as Swart raised his gun menac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly--hung on the rim of the glass and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped the twenty feet to the gravel in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side their prison. Dorothy climbed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dropped into his waiting arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">As the patrolman took the ladder down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sade and the other red-uniformed gorilla</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the house and walked toward them</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the field. They came up and halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the glass, staring in at them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">88</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing. Dorothy stood beside Norman</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he took her hand tightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When we leave we'll start to work," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered. "We've got to get you out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of here quick."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why only me ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He told her about Keren's hypodermic</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. "But first you've got to believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">me," he said. "I didn't desert you when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I left with Keren. It was our only chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to escape. I was coming back for you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You've got to believe me." He turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took her shoulders in his hands, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">into her blue eyes-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slie bit her lips, staring at him. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I don't want to believe anything else."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norman squeezed her shoulders, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced up to see Sade and his men walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing toward the cruiser, leaving the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted except for Keren chained to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">doom of unspeakable horror inside. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruiser leaped from the field and floated</seg><seg type="columnLine">past them over the jungle. Eying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">high rim of the glass wall, Norman waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the ship disappeared over the horizon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then backed against the glass quickly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">held out his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick!" he told Dorothy. "Stand on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my shoulders and try jumping!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorothy placed one small foot into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and swung up to his shoulders. Nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man raised to his tiptoes--every inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">counted. "Jump! High!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her fingertips missed the rim of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass two full feet and clawing the slick</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface, she slid back down into Norman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms. "Try again! We've got to get you</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of here!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again and again she placed her foot in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norman's hand, swung up, leaped high--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fell back again, her forehead bruised</seg><seg type="columnLine">from bumping the glass, her fingernails</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll never make it," Norman said</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearily. "We've got to think of some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else. " Hammering his fist into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">palm, he started pacing the wall. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he dropped to his knees and started clawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gravel. But he hadn't dug six inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he scraped against concrete. Several</seg><seg type="columnLine">different holes proved the ring of glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested on what had been a refueling plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form. "Sade would have thought of that."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He started pacing the wall again, running</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand around the smooth glass. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to be a way out! The glass had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the pilot-room shell of a ship, its tapering</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose sliced off. He thought of trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock it back and forth to turn it over.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the glass weighed tons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned and stared at Dorothy help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly. She had scratched her finger in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of her falls. Proving again that only</seg><seg type="columnLine">her body had grown, she immediately stuck</seg><seg type="columnLine">her finger in her mouth upon the discovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the scratch. Norman's brain seethed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He couldn't let this girl die here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, he realized, he faced the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem that had been Johnny's. And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew what withering shadow would claim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorothy's lips if he failed. Vulcan was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hell of priceless, fleeing moments; each</seg><seg type="columnLine">heartbeat a drum sounding a sickening</seg><seg type="columnLine">doom of decay. Each tick of his watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the footfall of death one step closer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The invisible terror that hovered over Vul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can was beyond the grasp of imagination--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was real! As real as Keren's pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">face under that trickle of red horror, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">real as Dorothy's fresh loveliness which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would soon be eaten away--unless he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">get her away from here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neither he nor Dorothy had any metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which he might attempt Johnny's mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">feat. Standing there, looking about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosure, Norman's heart beat quicker with</seg><seg type="columnLine">each second as each second took its unseen</seg><seg type="columnLine">toll upon the girl who was his responsi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility. Looking at her golden hair glinting</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sunlight, Norman suddenly realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was more than a responsibility . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quickly he turned away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GLASS was thick, perfectly clear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only its glimmer in the sun said they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were imprisoned. Beyond the field, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever dying and growing jungle undulated</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a green sea. Just outside the glass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ladder lay on the gravel where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">patrolman had dropped it--within arm's</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach and it might as well have been light</seg><seg type="columnLine">years away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look!" Dorothy cried. "The scratch</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my finger's already healed." She held</seg><seg type="columnLine">up her finger and there was no mark on it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vulcan's power was working, building a</seg><seg type="columnLine">life then to tear it down. Each soul-wring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing second created beauty, clear blue-eyed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">honey-haired beauty--to transform it as</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly into ugliness. . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CITADEL OF DEATH	89</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the first time in Norman's event-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful life that he had ever stared defeat in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face. He had met death before and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been in some pretty tight spots but</seg><seg type="columnLine">always there had been some way out. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. There was no possible way to climb</seg><seg type="columnLine">a twenty-foot wall of perpendicular oil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">slick glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm afraid I've failed you, Dorothy,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. In his mind now was only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of something he must not do. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't allow her to go through the horror</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had seen on Johnny's gray face. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hours, when he saw the first gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair--he looked down at his hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were his only weapons against a</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer torture. Could he kill Dorothy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own hands . . .?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well," Dorothy broke in on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts.. "Sade wins; and when we go,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole universe is next." Her voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a full octave lower than Norman had</seg><seg type="columnLine">first heard it when she appeared at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">galley door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norman walked over and stood before</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. "Whatever happens," he said, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want you to know this--that I've fallen in</seg><seg type="columnLine">love with you. You're the bravest woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've ever known and the most beautiful.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That combination usually doesn't go to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked up at him with very blue and</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious eyes. "I've been in love with you</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a long time," she said. "Ever since I</seg><seg type="columnLine">first saw your picture in the paper. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">why I came with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her words were cut off by Norman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips. Then quickly he left her and walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the glass, staring out at the wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whipped jungle. Why wait? Why go</seg><seg type="columnLine">through this torture any longer? Get it</seg><seg type="columnLine">over with now!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gods of the universe, forgive me," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered and turned to take her throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Light flashed across his face. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorothy's mirror. She held it, smoothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">her sun-burnished hair. A thought burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his consciousness like a butterfly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cocoon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He jumped over and snatched the mirror</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her hand, ripped his watch from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrist and flipped off the crystal with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumbnail, letting the watch drop to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What're you doing 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't bother to answer. His pulse</seg><seg type="columnLine">was liquid fire as he held the watch crystal</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the glass wall with one hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">focused the rays of the sun into it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mirror. A thin curl of smoke rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the jungle across the field. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the smoke had been an orange flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">licked up from the dry grass. He dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mirror and the watch crystal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed Dorothy close to him in the cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of their prison, holding her tightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Why! Why!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll see!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LASHED by the wind, the fire spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a flood. A blast of smoke engulfed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass obscuring their view with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">swirling whiteness. Then bits of flaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashes dotted the smoke as the flames found</seg><seg type="columnLine">new fuel in the rotted trees. Standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, holding Dorothy in his arms, Nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man saw the glass around them slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">darken. Quickly, as the wind brought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">increasing heat upon them, the glass turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">black and all he could see was the wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke rolling across the hole at the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their stifling cage. He felt Dorothy</seg><seg type="columnLine">coughing. Heat swam in the blackness</seg><seg type="columnLine">about them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then almost as suddenly as it had begun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind swept the smoke away and Nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man tore himself away from Dorothy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang to the glass wall. Without waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">till the glass lightened, he ran his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">across its blistering surface. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thermal quality of the glass permitted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage of light and the sight of the smol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering forest across the field, Norman was</seg><seg type="columnLine">half way up the slick side, climbing like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ladder the bulging ridges that encircled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass at its invisible seams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Dorothy stared at him, unbelieving,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he vaulted over the rim and jolted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinging feet to the hot gravel outside. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal ladder was like a live coal in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands but he barely felt it as he threw it</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall and ran up it like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">squirrel. Sitting on the cooling rim, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew the ladder up after him and dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">it inside for Dorothy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon they were streaking across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steaming gravel toward the house, Doro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thy's hair streaming in the smoky wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norman burst into the big front room</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Dorothy behind him. Their running</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet were loud in the silent house as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">90	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sped down the corridor, Norman dreading</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he would find tied to the cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they had left Keren. "You don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to see this," he said, halting at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed door. "Try these other doors and</seg><seg type="columnLine">find a gun. Sade may be back any</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorothy obediently turned away as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went in and the sight that met his eyes was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to figure in many a future nightmare. Half</seg><seg type="columnLine">way between the door and the cylinder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keren lay on the floor, more like some hide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous reptile than a human being, staring up</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him, her eyes two black holes, hate alive</seg><seg type="columnLine">in them, the only life in what was left of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norman stepped over and picked her up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fingers recoiling from the touch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">leathern skin and bone. Her luxurious</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair had vanished leaving a skull, cracked</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin tight across her cheek bones. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope that had held her to the cylinder had</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped from her shrunken wrists and how</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had crawled this far, Norman couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He carried her to the cylinder, opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy cap and drew out the small hose</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Sade had used to restore to youth the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white rat. Quickly, he sprayed the pink</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid upon her face and body--a treatment</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was to rewrite all of medical science.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her cheeks swelled again to the form of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">living face and like a trick of superimposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion picture work, before his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keren's skeletal structure became covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">again with firm, rounded flesh, and on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head wispy black threads appeared and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended again into a silken sable mass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To save the spark of life that remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Johnny, Norman knew he had to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">this material back to Earth now; which</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant a finish fight for a space ship. "Are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you strong enough now? We've got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambush Sade."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was an effort for Keren to reorganize</seg><seg type="columnLine">her forgotten coordinations which enabled</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to speak. Her lips moved soundlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he carried her to the door and down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passage. He explained quickly how</seg><seg type="columnLine">he and Dorothy had escaped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are guns in the tower," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to whisper as they entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorothy stood at the door with two jet</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifles, peering out at the still deserted field.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I found these in their bedroom," she said,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">handing Norman one of the guns. "Is she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">all right? I thought--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norman told her what he had done to</seg><seg type="columnLine">revive Keren.

"Sade</seg><seg type="columnLine">will see the empty cage and know there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">something wrong when he comes in to</seg><seg type="columnLine">land. He will probably attack the house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We've got to get back in the cage. Keren</seg><seg type="columnLine">can vaccinate you," he nodded to Dorothy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">allaying her hesitation. "When they land,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll jump out and take care of as many as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can.

Let's go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the cutter in one hand and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle in the other, Norman left the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">again with Dorothy running beside him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the glass cage again, it was short</seg><seg type="columnLine">work to cut a narrow door at the base of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smooth wall. With an eye on the hori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zon, Norman quickly covered the cutter</seg><seg type="columnLine">with gravel, then motioned Dorothy into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the invisible enclosure that had been their</seg><seg type="columnLine">prison and so nearly their mausoleum.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We'll play dead," he explained, stretching</seg><seg type="columnLine">out on the gravel with the two rifles hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">under him. Dorothy lay down beside him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"When they leave the ship and come over</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, I'll jump out. You stay inside in</seg><seg type="columnLine">case they get a chance to shoot back."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly the air hummed with the flow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rockets. "Here they are!" But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound told Norman that his job was doubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in danger. There were two ships now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other, his own. They'd repaired it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rockets idling, they hovered over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field and slowly settled. Sade's group was</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CtTADEL OF DEATH	91</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">now split in two parties--he couldn't sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise them both. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't move!" Norman whispered, feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Dorothy's soft hair against his cheek.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His fingers tightened on the guns under</seg><seg type="columnLine">his body. His pulse was loud in his ears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If they suspected something? But it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too late for worry now. He heard foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps on the gravel as the sound of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rockets sputtered and died away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NEXT second was a lifetime.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then suddenly he was on his feet. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled, ducked out through the hole in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass. The guns in his hands were</seg><seg type="columnLine">spitting their red streams, before his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the men before him, and he played</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guns like two garden hoses, spraying</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. The two patrolmen fell, charred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and black. But the two groups had ruined</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ambush. Swart sprang aside, behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass wall as the flame streaked past</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Norman saw Sade standing the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ship, staring at the wild scene. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">door was slammed shut as Norman's guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">splattered the hull with fire. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight was between him and Swart alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the opposite sides of the ring of</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass, Dorothy standing there horrified</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them, it was one of the strangest</seg><seg type="columnLine">situations in Norman's experience. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass was impervious to jet fire. Dorothy</seg><seg type="columnLine">was perfectly safe. But as Norman moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the wall to get a shot at Swart, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark little man also moved, keeping the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arc of glass between them. It couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">continue. A sudden sheet of flame rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">past one side of the glass, Sade firing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ship. Swart was not slow to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take advantage of the opportunity. Quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he slid around the wall to corner Norman</seg><seg type="columnLine">against Sade's fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norman stood waiting, rifles poised to</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast Swart's gun barrel as it nosed past</seg><seg type="columnLine">the curve of glass. But Swart was no fool.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was playing for time. Norman heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throbbing as Sade started his rockets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sade was moving the ship to trap him</seg><seg type="columnLine">between their guns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norman started to jump back through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hole in the glass. But that would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">suicide; while Swart guarded the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sade could pick them off from above in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship. Then an idea whispered in Nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's mind. If he could lure Swart from</seg><seg type="columnLine">die protection of the glass into Keren's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sights in the the tower--if he could trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keren--but there was nothing else to do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He ducked into the enclosure beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorothy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swart laughed. Norman could hear it</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside the glass. Quickly, Swart stepped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the hole, his pistol covering</seg><seg type="columnLine">their exit, smiling at them through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. "You ain't very bright, Norman."</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the last breath that ever passed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips, for a long, thin line of flame suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched from the tower to the small of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back. Swart dropped without a sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise on his dead face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Sade's ship was already in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He'll come and strafe us!" Norman</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted to Dorothy above the roar of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rockets. He took her hand, dragged her</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the cage past Swart's body. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to get to the cruiser; their only hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a fight with Sade in the air. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of Sade's rockets stopped Norman</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his tracks as he started to dash for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruiser. Sade's ship was skimming the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field, twenty feet off the ground, his rockets</seg><seg type="columnLine">sputtering like a gasoline engine with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken piston.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ship was headed directly toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house, apparently unable to rise. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norman saw what had happened. Keren's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle had hit the rise rocket tube. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily repaired solder work had burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">through. Unable to gain altitude, the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtled into the house like a freight plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone wild. The plastic walls ripped like</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinfoil as the ship's heavy nose plowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the building just below the tower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no explosion. The impact</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed the rockets. Dust plumed up like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a geyser, disappeared swiftly in the wind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving the ship hanging there tail out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuck in the building like an arrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norman and Dorothy were at the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the debris stopped falling. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">front room was choked with dust and'bits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of torn plastic rained from the ceiling as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they ran down the shadowy corridor. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">door leading to the tower stairs hung on</seg><seg type="columnLine">its hinges, admitting a beam of sunlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the demolished upper story. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran up the broken stairs, swaying precari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously. The cracked hull of the ship lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the debris of what remained of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower. The wall had been sheared off</seg><seg type="columnLine">level with the floor on one side and sway-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out from the foundation below a misty</seg><seg type="columnLine">92	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rainbow sparkled its colors in the sunlight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hissing softly as the red fluid escaped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pipe hidden in the wreckage. Sade's</seg><seg type="columnLine">well around which the house was built had</seg><seg type="columnLine">split in the crash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leaving Dorothy at the top of the stairs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norman climbed over the chunks of plas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic into the tower room. Then he realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">his foolhardiness. Too late. A chill tin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled the back of his neck as he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship's port hanging open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard Dorothy's warning cry behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as he turned around slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sade's grimy bulk stood beside a chunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">of plastic at the edge of the littered floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sunlight glistened on the pistol in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, as it squirted a stream of red flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the barrel of Norman's rifle. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun dropped from Norman's blistered fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You thought you could escape what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vulcan and I can do," Sade said. "None</seg><seg type="columnLine">can escape us, for Vulcan and I control</seg><seg type="columnLine">the universe from now on." He pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pistol to the floor at Norman's feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled the trigger. Norman stepped back</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the flame licked up around his shoes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Keep walking until you fall into that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rainbow down there!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait, Sade!" Norman stepped back</seg><seg type="columnLine">again as the line of fire followed him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's no time for this. That pipe's</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to burst wide open any moment!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He shifted from one foot to another, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soles of his shoes burning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jump," Sade said quietly. He raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun higher.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NORMAN retreated another step. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet lay between him and the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sheared wall, the end of the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then the misty lethal colors hissing</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten feet below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorothy scrambled over the plastic</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreckage and threw herself at Sade, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flat of his palm met her face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled her aside. The line of fire moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Norman's toes again, and he stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">back his last step. Like a cobra wavering</seg><seg type="columnLine">before its prey, the flame swept back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth across the floor, inches from Nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's toes, scorching the floor under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. He glanced down at the crimson mist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaping like a fountain under the splinters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of plastic jutting out over it. Then he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that fate had given him his chance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">--for a price.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had come to Vulcan to find some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to save Johnny's life. In the tank</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cruiser out on the field was the fluid</seg><seg type="columnLine">that could do that. On the broken wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">below him, just over the fountain of death,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a piece of the wreckage jutted outward</seg><seg type="columnLine">two feet--he could leap to that, swing</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear of the mist and reach the ship and</seg><seg type="columnLine">be free. He could save Johnny--by leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Dorothy behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There could be no compromise. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt that Sade would kill her the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant he realized the trick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norman glanced back into Sade's</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumphant smile. Suddenly he returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smile and laughed out loud. "When'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">you take your last vaccination, Sade!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed. "Did you know your hair had</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned white?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sade held his smile as steady as his gun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm not leaving you and look for a mir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror," he said. "No tricks will save you</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time. Those shots are good for 24</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not with all this raw stuff in the air,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norman laughed. "Look how your hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">have withered."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What matter," Sade said, "my Foun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain of Youth can restore me again." But</seg><seg type="columnLine">his smile loosened, and quick as light his</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance dropped to his hands. Norman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees straightened like steel springs. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of flame seared his hip as he sprang.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then his fist piled into Sade's heavy jaw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gun flew out and down into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mist. Sade hit the floor rolling and strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled to his feet as Norman was on him</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a hurricane. He crossed jabs into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face with both fists then stepped back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung a long arc that crushed the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's nose. Sade stumbled backward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed, arms flailing the air wildly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell backward off the edge of the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norman stepped over and looked down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deep in the eery rainbow mist that swirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him, Sade scrambled to his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked around frantically, confused</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the colors. His hair turned snow</seg><seg type="columnLine">white, his round cheeks tightened across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bones of his face and his big belly</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished in his baggy clothes. He held</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face and hands up before his face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgot Norman to stare at his skeleton-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like fingers. Then, his hands still raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CITADEL OF DEATH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">93</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">before his eyes, he sank to the ground as</seg><seg type="columnLine">his legs collapsed. The shoes fell off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bony feet as he lay there writhing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norman shook his head, rubbed his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sade wasn't writhing. It was the wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">rustling his clothes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norman found Dorothy's sunlit head</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed against his shoulder as she cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a baby. He touched her hair gently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then turned to the wreckage of the tower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment's search in the debris dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed Keren's broken form. He lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">her dead weight in his arms and with Dor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">othy behind him went quickly down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs. In the front room, he laid Keren</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the sofa and, risking one moment more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked a tapestry from the wall and gently</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered her body. Then they ran out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house and across the field to the cruiser.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he helped Dorothy through the port</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heard a cyclone roar from the house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He shoved Dorothy in, jumped in after</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and slammed the door. Through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass, they watched the house fly to pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a bursting bomb as a giant flower of</seg><seg type="columnLine">red spouted high over the field. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the house had been, stood a waver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing red column, feet thick, towering above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the green jungle. It sprayed down upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cruiser like a scarlet rain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stared at the vivid scene until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red film covered the cabin windows. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norman thumped the tank around the cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, heard its dull fullness, and walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the pilot room and sat down at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls. "There's plenty in the tank for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny," he said, "and there's plenty on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vulcan for the Universe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What shall we name it ?" Dorothy said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they soared away from the planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their increasing speed washed the red</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">film from the glass. Norman looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dwindling green globe that was Vulcan</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and lived again, swiftly, all that had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened there. And strangely, now that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was over, one phrase whispered in his mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll owe you a thousand kisses. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's name it 'Kerine,' " he said. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">owe her more than we can ever repay."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORD "Kerine" was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted in every street and across</seg><seg type="columnLine">every backyard fence in the universe two</seg><seg type="columnLine">days later and it was a tense moment out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side a closed white door in a hospital in</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York City. Although the surgery</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on the fifteenth floor, Norman and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorothy could hear the clamor in the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">below as thousands halted traffic for blocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">around and the policemen stood by with</seg><seg type="columnLine">folded arms, smiling. Downstairs, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lobby was packed with photographers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reporters, waiting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the white door opened, Norman and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorothy jumped to their feet.

As the stretcher rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the hall, the face appeared and deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">within his pounding heart, Norman yelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his joy.

Nolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the girl's hands for a sharp sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond, then relaxed. She knew what she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was doing. Unerringly the skid split the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the trail, following its many</seg><seg type="columnLine">turns as though on a track. But--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sudden high sound escaped her lips.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her foot trod hard on the back-jet pedal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The skid slewed crazily, its side crunching</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the cliff as it halted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the--" snarled Nolan, hand leap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the concealed pyro he wore under</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shirt.

Pie</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned sourly, then clambered into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat suit he'd just put off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He eyed the girl for a second. "I'm go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to have to trust you. I have to get to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Avalon, so I have to get this misbegotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrosity out of my way. And I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave the skid to do it. That gives you</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fair, clear chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl shook her head. "I'll take you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Avalon. I owe you that much. But--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but how--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Watch," Nolan said curtly, and climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the tank. Before he closed the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thought struck him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He poked his head out at her. "If any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing should go wrong," he said, "and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">find myself scattered all over that valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">down there, you'd better stay put. Keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crawler away with the brake jet. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait for someone to come along. You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the skidster to back this crate all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way down the trail, with just a brake jet."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he slammed the inner door, sealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his helmet, pushed his way out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crawler was even bigger than he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. Standing within ten feet of it, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt tiny and weak, a toy before this mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive brute. Like ancient Earth dinosaurs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crawlers kept growing as long as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived. Tiny as the palm of a man's hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot-high creatures like those Nolan had</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked out of his way an hour before or</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrosities like the one before him--all</seg><seg type="columnLine">three types existed side by side. Only sel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom did they grow as great as this. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulnerable though they were, they perished</seg><seg type="columnLine">of starvation, when their bulk grew too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much for their thousands of tiny legs to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out of the ebon hulk of the thing came</seg><seg type="columnLine">poking a minute head, goggle-eyed, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous halo of green tendrils surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it. It blinked weakly at Nolan. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited patiently. If the thing was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced he was harmless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was. Recovering from the shock of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skid's arrival it began to prepare for</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion again. The head poked out to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the skid on a long, scrawny neck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">examined it minutely. The big carapace</seg><seg type="columnLine">shivered and rose slightly off the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">98	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as the multitude of tiny legs took up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">task of carrying it forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan stood motionless. The creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved ponderously toward him, ignoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. In the dull mind of the creature an</seg><seg type="columnLine">object as tiny as a man was nothing. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skid was merely another sort of boul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, against which it could lean, send it</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtling over to destruction, out of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It moved forward till the hard horn al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most touched him. Then Nolan leaped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was the moment of decision. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">circled the long neck with one lashing arm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamped on it all the pressure he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring to bear. It was the one sensitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot the creature had--and protected, nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mally, by armor battleship-thick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan strained the muscles of his arm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursing the cushion of air inside his suit</seg><seg type="columnLine">that made a pillow for the beast. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">slippery flesh coiled and writhed in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip; the beast exhaled a great, whistling</seg><seg type="columnLine">screech of agony and the snakelike neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">curved around. The popeyed head darted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in at him, tiny mouth distended to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">raw, red flesh inside. It battered inef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectually against the heavy plastic face-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plate of his suit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crawler vented its whistling sigh</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and staggered drunkenly away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Away from the remorseless pressure on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">sore spot, away from the agonizing weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him. Its tiny legs carried it rocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidewise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then abruptly they tried to halt it, gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp warning to the tiny brain. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too late.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scrambling legs flailed for a foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold and found vacuum. Nolan gave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">final heave, felt the thing slide away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, leaped back. Just in time. He him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self was teetering on the brink of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chasm as the crawler, tiny head darting</seg><seg type="columnLine">frantically, soundlessly around, slid over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't look down. The clattering</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crashing vibrations from below told</seg><seg type="columnLine">what happened. He turned, shook himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">and headed for the skid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl was waiting for him. Nolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">was mildly surprised. She looked at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiously as he entered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A dirty job," she offered tentatively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shrugged. "Yes," he said. "Let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">get moving."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She turned without a word. All the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way back to Avalon, her back was a silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">reproach. Friendship, it said, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered--and rebuffed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan had his private thoughts, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwelt in them. Except for the muffled blast</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rockets there was no sound in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skid until they'd jetted into the great cargo</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock in Avalon's crystal dome and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">handlers had come to slide the skid into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a parking space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, as they got out, she smiled sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said, "I guess I misjudged you, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Matthews. I'm sorry I was discourteous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a girl can't be too careful. Let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">take you to dinner for an apology."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan paused and stared at her soberly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, "No, thanks," he said. "I meant it</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I said I wasn't interested in you. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have things on my mind already." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignored her outstretched hand, turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave, then stopped. "Oh, yes," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thanks for the ride."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked cumbrously over to a storage</seg><seg type="columnLine">cubicle without looking back. He stripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">off his heat suit and checked it with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stout man in Pluto-city green.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was time to plan his next move. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a pilot's hangout, he remembered, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon called the Golden Ray. He took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn notebook from his shirt pocket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumbed it to the forgotten address and</seg><seg type="columnLine">held the page up for the checking attendant</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do I get there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man's eyes widened a fraction as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took the address in. He shrugged imper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptibly. "Any slidewalk going north,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "Get off at the Hub and you'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a couple blocks of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOLAN nodded and headed for a mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sidewalk. The notebook went</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into the pocket of his open-necked</seg><seg type="columnLine">black shirt, and the hand that put it there</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused a second to touch reassuringly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of a slim-barreled pyro that swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath his armpit, out of sight. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nice to know it was there, even though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't need it--yet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused in a robot restaurant to eat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saloons like the Golden Ray don't sell</seg><seg type="columnLine">much food--particularly to those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">have tasted it once. It was getting on to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">HIGHWAYMAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The slidewalks were fast, and the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">man he stopped at the Hub told him all he</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed to know to find the saloon. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">he got within a block of it, it all began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come back. It had been years since he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">been there, but the place hadn't changed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A blast of sound struck him as he clawed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way through thick tobacco smoke and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet Martian hop-incense fumes to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar. He nodded his head, and the short</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion yanked a fat bartender to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man's slitted eyes peeped surpris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly through the surrounding tallow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gunner!" he whispered, amiable but</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarse. "Thought you were somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">around Jupe. What'll it be?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It'll be nothing right now," Nolan said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I thought Petersen might be here. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to see him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, sure," the bartender said. "He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">dealin' red-dog at one o' the tables in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan was called "Gunner" by those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who knew him by his alias-- He'd never</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken the trouble to think up a first name</seg><seg type="columnLine">for "Matthews." He nodded and stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It wasn't hard to find Petersen when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you knew his habits. The wrinkled little</seg><seg type="columnLine">man always sat in the noisiest spot he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">find. This time it was a table right behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the four-piece orchestra, pride of the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prietor's heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan stood silently for a moment be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the little man's chair to watch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">play. He marveled at the ease with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Petersen's gnarled fingers handled the fly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing pasteboards. As usual, Petersen's pile</seg><seg type="columnLine">of chips was low, and the set of his back</seg><seg type="columnLine">was discouraged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan grinned. It was part of Peter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sen's stock-in-trade to look like the tail end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a losing streak. The sucker trade stays</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from a winning gambler. But they</seg><seg type="columnLine">flocked to Petersen--and his pockets were</seg><seg type="columnLine">always clinking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Petersen's gambler's sixth sense was</seg><seg type="columnLine">functioning. He twitched his shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncomfortably, then turned around, glar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up. "Say," he began, "who the hell</seg><seg type="columnLine">are-- Oh, Gunner I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan nodded. "Hey there, Peter," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Petersen grinned and blinked. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">wi&lt;'1' regret at his top card, then at Nolan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No?" he asked wistfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF THE VOID	99</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan shook his head. "No."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little man shrugged and flipped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cards away. "Okay," he said cheerfully,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoveling his chips into his clanking pock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ets. "Lead on, Gunner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan led on, to a more secluded comer</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the clamor of the alleged orchestra</seg><seg type="columnLine">was less deafening. He sent a waiter off</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a bottle of sealed Terrestrial Scotch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then turned to Petersen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's Woller?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Petersen scowled. "Listen, Steve," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">begged, "stay out of trouble. Woller's big</seg><seg type="columnLine">here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't call me Steve," Nolan said</seg><seg type="columnLine">mildly. Two living men knew that Nolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Matthews were the same. Petersen</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one of them--Nolan himself the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I manage my own affairs. I want to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Woller."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Okay," Petersen groaned. "He's at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elena. The big hotel near South Lock."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolan nodded. "Good enough," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "I'll take care of my business widi</seg><seg type="columnLine">him right away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The greasy-aproned waiter came back</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Scotch. Nolan inspected the seal</seg><seg type="columnLine">critically, then broke it and poured two</seg><seg type="columnLine">generous slugs. "How!" he said. "What've</seg><seg type="columnLine">you been doing with yourself, Pete?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Petersen swallowed his Scotch, grim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aced non-committally. "Following the pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectors," he said. "Making money and</seg><seg type="columnLine">losing it. It's been a long time since you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan ignored the implied question.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Pretty long," he agreed. "I wasn't figur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on coming, but I heard Woller was</seg><seg type="columnLine">here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Petersen nodded his head sadly. "You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">aching for trouble," he observed. "Wol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ler's no man to buck up against. He's got</seg><seg type="columnLine">money behind him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whose money?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I dunno. Some Martian syndicate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they say. He's come a long way since he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was your boss at Telenews."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not so long I couldn't follow him."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Petersen cocked an eyebrow, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured another round. "You followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him into a bad spot," he said slowly. "This</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole town is be-jittered. He's doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">about what he likes and nobody says boo."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Petersen frowned. " 'Cause they're</seg><seg type="columnLine">scared, it looks. Scared of the Junta.</seg><seg type="columnLine">100	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Talk is there are Junta men around. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't have to remind you, I guess, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what Woller can say about you if he sees</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan nodded. "He won't see me--in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time for it to do him any good."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Petersen shivered. "You're building up</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble," he repeated. "Woller's pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">near running this place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'A louse,' " Nolan quoted, " 'enthroned</seg><seg type="columnLine">in luxury, will still a loathsome insect</seg><seg type="columnLine">be.' That's Woller."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Petersen's wizened little troll-face gaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him. "Lice bite," he said succinctly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan said soberly, "Live ones do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After tonight Woller may not be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bite anybody. Dead lice have no friends."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STEVE NOLAN was deceptively slen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der in his open-necked, black military</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt and trim khaki slacks. In the half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearted illumination thrown by Avalon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">old gasglow lights, he looked almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">boyish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he didn't look like the pale youth</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd been three years before. The good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">natured roundness of his face had con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracted to show the hard bone underneath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was the ghost of a scar close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">an eye, and the seared mark of pyro burn</seg><seg type="columnLine">where neck joined his right shoulder. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">long fingers that once had twirled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">toggles of a field newscaster's walky-talky</seg><seg type="columnLine">now were better acquainted with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">groves of a pyro butt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For the last time," he said, "you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">better off home in bed. I think there</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be trouble."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Petersen looked sour. "Good thinking,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "I have a hunch that way, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm going to stick around."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan shrugged. He eyed the Hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elena, towering almost up to the crystal</seg><seg type="columnLine">dome, directly across the street from him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's your neck," he said. "You can catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">me when I fly out" He glanced quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a wrist-chrono. "A quarter after</seg><seg type="columnLine">four," he said. "If I'm not out in half</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour don't wait up. I may be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before Petersen could answer he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossing the street, entering the hotel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Elena was large, and the night clerk</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't be expected to know every guest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He glanced up as Nolan entered, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back to nodding over his magazine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolan walked to the grav-well and stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan let the curiously soothing grav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">currents flow over him, carrying him up</seg><seg type="columnLine">till he'd ascended twelve floors. That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Woller was, by the best informa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion Petersen had been able to give him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He reached out a hand and swung himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the flow, into a silent corridor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not quite silent. Nolan listened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled. There was a party somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead; a vise-box blared briefly in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rooms on this corridor as a sleep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less guest hunted music. From the grav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well came the low humming of the gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erators.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was fine. If it were necessary to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make any noise it might be confused with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vise-box, or the singing from overhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Woller's door was locked, of course.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolan bent over the keyhole for a second.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a tinny, springy click, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door drifted open under the slow pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The room was large and empty. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">library, perhaps, as well as he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">judge by the intermittent blood-tinted</seg><seg type="columnLine">light that filtered in from an advertising</seg><seg type="columnLine">stereolume across the street. Nolan flipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cigarette lighter out, held it aloft and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed the button. In the dim glow it</seg><seg type="columnLine">shed he saw twin doors. After a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment's hesitation, he chose one, opened it</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently, slipped through into a bedroom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A night light glowed softly on the wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealing nothing. Nolan sniffed the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiously, then wrinkled his nose. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fume! Woller had added a new vice to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his character. Nolan grimaced contemptu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously, then moved toward the indistinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure on the bed. His right hand dipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside his shirt, came away with the slim</seg><seg type="columnLine">pyro protruding from his fist</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Woller," he said. "Wake up. You've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got company."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE WAS A rustle from the bed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gasp, a metallic click. Nolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped back, cursing. He flung an arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his head as the overhead lumes burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">into blinding light. But he'd caught a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick, stunning glimpse of what was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bed and, quicker than starflight, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pyro jutted toward the lumes, flared</seg><seg type="columnLine">HIGHWAYMAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wickedly. All lights died as the blast</seg><seg type="columnLine">shorted the wires.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had been a girl in the bed, blinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">up sleepily, mouth a taut line of surprise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The girl--the one from the skid, the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd encountered in Annihilation Range!</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had no more of a look at him than</seg><seg type="columnLine">he at her, and she had been sleep-dazed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring up at the light. Perhaps she hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized him--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold still," he hissed--there is no per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonality to a whisper. "Where's Alan</seg><seg type="columnLine">Woller?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are you?" the girl's voice came,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trifle unsteady. Good--she hadn't recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized him!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan laughed voicelessly. "I'm the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with the gun," he replied. "I ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">the questions. Where's Woller?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None of your business," the girl said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a note of confidence in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, and suddenly Nolan felt a furtive</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement from the bed. Was there an</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm--a bell to summon servants?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold it!" he whispered sharply. "One</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong move and I'll kill you. I mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">business--and I want an answer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl's voice was even now. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't give one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan's brows drew down over his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What was this girl to Woller? Whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">the connection was, by rights he should</seg><seg type="columnLine">take no chances. The girl was a danger to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him--and the life of no woman on Wol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ler's string should be permitted to stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">between him and the chance for vengeance</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the man who had framed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll give you ten seconds," he whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered harshly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But already he was stepping silently</seg><seg type="columnLine">backward, concealed in the abyss-black</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloom of the chamber. He reached noise-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly behind him for the knob of the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was being a fool and he knew it</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he had seen honesty in her eyes, back</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the skid, and even the yearning for</seg><seg type="columnLine">revenge couldn't make him blot that out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with pyro-fiame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He opened the door, slid out, closed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly behind him. The girl said nothing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps had not known he had gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolan cast a quick longing glance at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other door, but there was no time. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds the girl would discover she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. There would be an alarm, surely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A dim thread of light showed him the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF THE VOID	101</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">door to the hall. Catlike he crossed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, then halted, petrified. Men were com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down the hall, several of them by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices. He caught a snatch of a rasping</seg><seg type="columnLine">complaint: "Old man IVoiler's tin soldiers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's us. Who the hell does he--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan swore lividly under his breath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The end of the trail had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he stepped back a pace and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, pyro up-tilted and ready. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have a split-second's advantage. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">only there were no more than two or</seg><seg type="columnLine">three of them--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND THEN the sound was drowned</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. A sharp, moaning screech came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from outside. A harsh metallic wail that</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed for the frigid heavens above,</seg><seg type="columnLine">louder than the screaming trumpets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ragnarok.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The alarm sirens! There was a break in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crystal dome that held the life of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Avalon!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meteorite, accident or simple fatigue--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dome had cracked. Air and heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">would vanish. Death would tenant the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a sudden, sharp babble from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men outside, then the pounding of</seg><seg type="columnLine">footsteps, halting as they dove into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grav-shaft. Nolan's chance! But he froze</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his tracks, then whirled. He ran to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door behind him and wrenched it</seg><seg type="columnLine">open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get a heat suit!" he bawled to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl on the bed. "Dome's cracked!</seg><seg type="columnLine">You've got maybe twenty minutes--less,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it's a bad break!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice was a bellow--there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">time for whispers. No time, and per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps no need. If the dome had gone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Avalon might be a city of corpses, heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">suits or none, before help could arrive</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fresh oxygen tanks from far-away</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aylette. Disguise would hardly matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he wasted no time in thought. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was out the door, down the hall and drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping into the cushioning grav-web of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">descending shaft in seconds. Guests were</seg><seg type="columnLine">waking in their rooms. The corridors</seg><seg type="columnLine">were filling with shouting men and women.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The shriek of emergency trucks filtered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in from the street, and the hoarse bellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the alarm sirens multiplied the havoc</seg><seg type="columnLine">done to the peace of the night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">102	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If he could get to a ship--?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the slidewalks would be jammed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with panicky humans, all with the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. A heat suit was his only chance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the nearest ones he knew of were at</seg><seg type="columnLine">South Lock, at the base of the dome itself!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He swung himself out of the shaft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">raced across the lobby, which was already</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to fill with people intent on</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape. He was out the door with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">van of them, racing across a still empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">street toward South Lock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A slim, pale figure darted across in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of him. He moved to dodge past,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then slowed momentarily as he saw who</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Steve!" Only one man knew that name</seg><seg type="columnLine">--Petersen!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. "Pete! What are you waiting for?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Come on--get a suit!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Petersen sighed, touched Nolan's shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der to halt him. "There's no hurry, pal,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said mildly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No hurry! The dome alarm--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Petersen shook his head. "Forget it,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "I turned the alarm in myself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TOWARD what passed for morning in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Avalon, the confusion died down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The emergency cars were off the streets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sirens had long since stopped wailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the last irate citizen had retired for</seg><seg type="columnLine">what remained of a night's sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Petersen came back from the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his shabby little one-room apartment</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reported on progress to Nolan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All quiet," he said. "Sure you won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">change your mind and lie down for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while? you'll be needing sleep pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan swallowed the rest of his coffee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stubbed out a cigarette and shook his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No time," he said. He glanced at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chrono. "I figure on leaving in twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes. You're sure Woller's going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be on that ship?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Petersen grinned. "Pretty sure," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "I have my ways."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You looked good on the deal last</seg><seg type="columnLine">night," Nolan said. "You and your</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammy ideas. I would have got out with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out all that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Petersen was serious. "Not alive, no.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When I saw those apes coming down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street I was pretty sure something was</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. So I got on a phone--I got a friend</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">works for Woller's company, and he reads</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boss' mail--and that's what he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Woller has to get back to the Inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">Planets in a hurry. He's sent a bunch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his company guards to pick up some stuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his apartment. The only thing I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of was to turn in the alarm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope you'd get out in the confusion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're a smart boy, but you ain't Dead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye Dick, friend. You couldn't of fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">it out with five of Woller's finest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan inclined his head. "Maybe you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. You say something big seems to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be up ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What else? He gets a red-hot sealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">teleflash from Aylette. Sealed, mind you</seg><seg type="columnLine">--my friend can't listen in. He cancel's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the orders of the only ship his new com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany has in Avalon--cancels all the cargo</seg><seg type="columnLine">contracts--and takes off in it in the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the night for Aylette. He'll be back</seg><seg type="columnLine">here this morning, they say, to pick up</seg><seg type="columnLine">those papers. Then they're off again, deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, this time. The clearance says</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan nodded. His face was impassive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a slight crinkling of the lines around</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lean nose showed thought. What was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Woller up to?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was curiously difficult to concentrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Woller. Absently, he found himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying, "And you don't know who the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My information don't go that far,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Petersen admitted. "He has a daughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">some place, but she ain't supposed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">here now. But what's your guess about</seg><seg type="columnLine">this she?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My guess is you're right," Nolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed reluctantly. There was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">about soft blue eyes and silk-fine black</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair that did not fit in the same picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Woller.	N</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peterson was looking at him shrewdly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a dim light of understanding glow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in his eyes and a hint of pity. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolan looked at him, Petersen looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, began fumbling inside his waist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">band.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What're you doing?" Nolan asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll need money," said Petersen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He finished unbuckling and dragged out</seg><seg type="columnLine">an oiled-silk money belt. Without open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it, he tossed it to Nolan. "Here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You'll have to bid high to get passage</seg><seg type="columnLine">HIGBW AYMAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on Woller's ship. This'll help."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan nodded. "Thanks," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Look, I--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Petersen waved a hand airily. "Forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. As long as there's enough radium on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pluto for prospectors to find, I'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty money."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," said Nolan. "But the thanks</seg><seg type="columnLine">still goes." He closed his eyes for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second, rubbed them. Then he blinked</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly, took out his pyro and checked it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Full clip, save the one shell he'd used on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light last night. Twenty-three shots.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He defdy slipped another cartridge in to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the full two dozen, then replaced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun in its shoulder holster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're going to get into trouble with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that thing," Petersen prophesied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan shrugged. "I've got a name to</seg><seg type="columnLine">live up to. A gunner has to have a gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and I kind of think I'm going to need</seg><seg type="columnLine">this one." He glanced at the chrono</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and stood up, stretching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, good-by," he said casually. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">owe you a bunch of favors. You won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to remind me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Course not," Petersen agreed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wouldn't do much good. But I'll sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mention it to your heirs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT THE Operations lock of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Avalon spaceport Nolan opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money belt Petersen had given him for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time. He peered inside and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cards had been with Petersen, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. The little man had carried a young</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortune around with him. He tucked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt in a pocket with a mental resolve to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay it back some day, if he lived long</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, and went into the observation</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the crystal dome he could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship, the only one on the field. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a beauty--brand-new and glistening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By the look of her, she was the latest</seg><seg type="columnLine">type. Pure gravity drive, the rocket jets</seg><seg type="columnLine">used only for landing. It had a name,</seg><seg type="columnLine">limned phosphorescent on a dark panel</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the glittering hull: Dragonfly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned and walked over to the port</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearance officer. "I have to get to Mars,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "I hear this ship's bound there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who do I see about booking passage?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The port official scratched his bony head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's an unscheduled run/' he said, "and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF THE VOID	103</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I dunno if they're taking any passengers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But over there--" he waved a hand--"is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second mate. He might help you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thanks." Nolan walked over, eyeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pallid, short-bodied Venusian indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated. The man was staring glumly out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the observation panel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You the second on the ship out there?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolan asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man turned slowly and looked him</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and down. "Yeah," he said finally.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What about it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan allowed his eyes to narrow con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiratorially. "I hear you're bound for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars," he said, lowering his voice. "Any</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance of taking a passenger?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan tapped a pocket. "Listen," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "it isn't just that I want a ride. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to get to Mars. I'll pay."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Venusian laughed sharply and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolan thought, not for the first time, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">superior environment is to heredity. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venusians, like most of the System's intel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ligent life, were descended from Earthmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right, but the adjective that described</seg><seg type="columnLine">them best was "fishy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second said, "Pay? You haven't</seg><seg type="columnLine">got enough money to get you into the lock</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that ship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I don't know," Nolan said easily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took the money belt out of his pocket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed the contents for a second. "I meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">it," he said. "I have to get to Mars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Name your price--I've got it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Venusian's eyes widened. Nolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw, from the corner of his eye, a skid</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocketing across the field. It halted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dragonfly, and the ship's lock opened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two bulky, heat-suited figures hurried out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the skid, into the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you say?" Nolan persisted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">accelerated by the sight of the figures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of them would be Woller's thug with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the apparently vital papers. That would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the big one--the smaller might be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clerk from his office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Okay," the mate capitulated. "Tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you what. It'll cost you ten thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">credits. If it's worth that to you, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan shrugged wryly. "It's worth my</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck," he grinned confidentially.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Venusian grinned moistly back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Payable in advance," he specified. "Now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">104	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Give it to me and I'll go out and arrange</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deal with the captain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keeping a percentage of course, Nolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought; but he only nodded and silently</seg><seg type="columnLine">counted out the money. The Venusian</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed it without checking the count. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "Okay, I'll be back in a minute,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan watched him struggle into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit and clamber across the frigid soil</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the field. The lock opened for him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then closed again. Nolan sensed a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneasiness. He almost jumped when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">port officer came up behind him and said:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wouldn't take you, huh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan turned. "Sure," he said. "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to go arrange it with the captain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll go out with him when he comes back</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his clearance papers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Clearance papers!" the official barked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Good Lord, man, they've had those for</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours. That man isn't coming back!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOLAN, swearing incandescently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung his heat-suit voucher at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer, grabbed the first suit in the rack</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was in the main lock, waiting for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inner door to close, before he put it on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had already sealed the suit and stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out on the field when he noticed what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited hammering of the port official on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lock door should have told him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The suit had only a single oxygen tank</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its clip--and the gauge showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">"empty"!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hesitated only a moment. His eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught a glimpse of the Dragonfly, etched</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply against the black horizon by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field's blazing floodlights. Its smooth lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">were suddenly blurred and indistinct. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">grav-web was building up around it. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment it would be gone!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damn!" yelled Nolan, to the sole detri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of his own eardrums. Already the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight amount of air in his suit was nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">used up. But as soon as the web reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">full focus the Dragonfly would blast off</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Woller would be beyond reach for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan swore fervently, then sealed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">writhing lips to save air. He set off in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slow, heavy trot for the shimmering</seg><seg type="columnLine">spaceship. He was breathing pure carbon</seg><seg type="columnLine">dioxide and staggering nicely by the time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORMES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he pushed his way through the thickening</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistance of the grav-web to the massive</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer door of the lock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His bulging eyes caught the lever that</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the lock, guarded by a scoop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped streamshield. He yanked it</seg><seg type="columnLine">blindly, saw the heavy panel roll aside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some member of the crew must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been watching--someone with compassion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unexpected enough in a ship of Woller's.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The lock door clanged shut behind him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean air hissed in. Nolan tore frantically</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his faceplate and gulped deeply, dizzy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The metal flooring shuddered. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">an intolerable weight drag at his water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">weak body as the ship took off. He hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it by much, at that. A couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds more and he would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Boy!" Nolan gasped. "Somebody sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't want me along on this ride."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The inner door was sliding open. Nolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped out into a well lit corridor, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">colliding with the flabby bulk of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venusian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mate glared at him darkly, the hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his waist poised suggestively above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">butt of a pyro.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before he could speak, Nolan said</seg><seg type="columnLine">mildly, "You're a thieving louse. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm on the ship, and I won't hold it against</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Only--don't try that again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mate flushed. "The captain didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to take you," he mumbled. "I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to send your dough back soon's we</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched ground."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," Nolan agreed. "Having my</seg><seg type="columnLine">full name and address the way you do, it'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">be easy. Well, skip it. Where's my</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You wouldn't call it exactly hospitable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way the mate stalled as long as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could, obviously trying to cudgel his feeble</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venusian brain into some plan for getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">rid of the unwanted passenger. But Nolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally got his cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS the smallest and worst on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, of course, but the ship was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty. Nolan smiled in real appreciation</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he saw the room. The furniture was</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow-tinted plastic; the bed was covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Earth silk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Beat it," he told the mate, and watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">HIGHWAYMAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the door close behind him. Then he sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to chart a course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Woller might recognize him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was the first danger. True, Nolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been reported dead and Woller knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to the contrary. It was only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">miracle that Nolan wasn't dead, in fact.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only the incredible chance of his being</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up in midspace, where he floated</seg><seg type="columnLine">helplessly, one shoulder brutally pyro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarred and half the air gone from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit, had saved him then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That had been one miracle, for even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ranging, avid patrol boats hadn't been</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to find him after his mad leap from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock of the ship that was carrying him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Moon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But that miracle had occurred. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second miracle was that the pleasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft that saved him was piloted by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who lived outside the law but had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron-clad code of honesty--who wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn Nolan in for the bounty money on</seg><seg type="columnLine">fugitives. Pete Petersen's scrawny shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders bore no wings, but he'd seemed like</seg><seg type="columnLine">an angel to Nolan that desolate day, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd seen the flare of Nolan's desperate</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal rocket and swung round in a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">arc to pick him up, eventually to take him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the lawless safety of the Belt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To everyone but Petersen, Steve Nolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dead. And the little shots of gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">now running through Nolan's dark hair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the 'scar that crossed one tanned cheek,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him a new personality. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender and dangerous as a lunging rapier,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and every bit as cold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Woller would have good cause to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember Nolan. Woller had sat there</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the courtroom, back on Earth. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat there the whple dragging week of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trial, with Nolan's eyes on him every</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute. He looked directly at Nolan, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he was in the chair, telling the lies</seg><seg type="columnLine">that linked Nolan with the Junta--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret, revolutionary group of outer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet malcontents that sought to over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw Tri-planet Law's peace and order.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan's lips contorted savagely as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">recalled that. A traitor I His sole crime</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been that he knew too much about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Woller, his boss!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Woller had been clever about it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">law itself had removed Nolan, a menace</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his lawless schemes. When Nolan, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own initiative, had talked and bribed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF THE VOID	105</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his way into seeing a confessed and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">demned saboteur of the Junta for an inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">view, he'd found to his sick astonishment</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the man was one he had seen in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Woller's own office, not two months be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He'd been childishly simple about it, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">confronted Woller and demanded an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planation. Woller had put on his friend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liest face and promised one--later. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then Woller had turned the dogs</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within an hour Nolan was in jail for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bribery of the prison officials. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">next morning came the incredible indict-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment-- Sabotage for the Junta!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan grimaced, recalled the careful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hideous network of lies and forgeries, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distorted evidence, the perjuries. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been one man, and Woller represented</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then abruptly there was a knock on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. Jolted out of his thoughts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolan started, then called: "Just a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was the moment--and he had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan. His pyro slid out into his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He broke it, stared at the twenty-four</seg><seg type="columnLine">potent heat charges. They would be plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for him, if he got a clear shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Woller. But if he should be disarmed, .</seg><seg type="columnLine">if Woller should suspect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment later, the pyro hidden be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath his shirt again, he opened the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the Venusian second, as before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Captain wants to see you," he growled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Dragonfly was a single-deck craft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain's cabin located topside of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck and amidships. Nolan looked around</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiously, despite his internal tension, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he followed the Venusian along. The plas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic keel panel underfoot showed an infinity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stars. There was one, large and bright,</seg><seg type="columnLine">outstanding among the lesser stars. Nolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized it--the Sun, parent star to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">farflung planet they'd just left. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was dim and feeble, but by the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">they got within sight of the Inner Worlds</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be a ravenous thing, reaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to destroy them with lethal radiations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out of curiosity, he asked. "When are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you going to opaque?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh?" The Venusian looked startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a second; then his blubber-drowned</seg><seg type="columnLine">106	PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">little eyes became shrewd. "Oh, about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Orbit Saturn, I guess."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOLAN suppressed a sudden frown.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He asked carefully, "Say, how do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you do it on these new-type ships anyhow?</seg><seg type="columnLine">All the ones I've been on, you had to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the panels filter-shuttered before they lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Paint," the mate said curtly.

It would take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole crew, and they'd never get it off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If they opaqued with paint the ship would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be blind for weeks. The filter shutters--</seg><seg type="columnLine">great strips of polarized colloid--were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only solution to the problem of keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the worst of the sun's dread radia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, but admitting enough light to guide</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship. But they had to be put on</seg><seg type="columnLine">externally, before the ship took off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars? This ship, ports transparent as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were, would never dare approach</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun's blinding energies closer than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jupiter!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No wonder they didn't want me, Nolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought grimly. They're not going within</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred million miles of Mars!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thought froze in Nolan's mind as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he entered the captain's cabin. First he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the captain, a tall, demon-black</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martio-Terrestrial, standing before his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own desk. Then his eyes flicked past,</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the florid-faced man who sat be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the desk, fumbling with a cigarette</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighter. \</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, for the first time in three</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, he was face to face with Alan</seg><seg type="columnLine">Woller.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan might have showed a flicker of</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion in his face. Heaven knows, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast of iron hatred that surged up</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his body was powerful enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Woller was lighting a cigarette. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">second that it took him to finish it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">look up was time enough for Nolan to</seg><seg type="columnLine">freeze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Vincennes is my name," the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">was saying. "What's yours?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Matthews. I'm sorry to have forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">my way onto your ship, but I had to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Mars."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Woller looked Up then, and a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">trace of consternation flashed into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. It died away, but a doubt remained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stared intently at Nolan, then said:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan smiled easily. "A lot of reasons</seg><seg type="columnLine">--all of them personal. Who are you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Woller stood up. "I own this ship," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said coldly. "I didn't ask you aboard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now that you're here, you'll answer my</seg><seg type="columnLine">question or get off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The time for a showdown had arrived.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, Nolan thought, it had to come some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. He was strangely relaxed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shrugged. "You've got a point</seg><seg type="columnLine">there," he admitted. "Well--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He frowned and raised his hand as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though to scratch his head, changed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion in mid-air. And with the speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a hopped-up narcophene smoker, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin-snouted pyro was in his fist, slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">traversing a lethal arc that covered both</seg><seg type="columnLine">men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice was taut as he spoke. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">your ship, Woller, but I'm taking it over.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Woller--Alan Woller--look at me. Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you 'know who I am?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Woller stared deep into the icy eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">confronting him. The doubt flared again</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his own. His jaw dropped slack. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">brows lifted and he whispered, "Nolan!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolan didn't bother to nod. He said</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly, "Your hands--hold them where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are. You, too, Vincennes. I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">come a long way for this and I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind killing. You taught me that, Woller.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A man's life is nothing. Mine was noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to you, when it endangered the dirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">little treacheries you were working."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The life seemed to have gone out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Woller and left only a hulking, pallid</seg><seg type="columnLine">carcass, propped up by. the internal pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure of its own fear. There was murky</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror crawling in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STEVE NOLAN looked at him and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin lips curled into a snarling grin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But those were only his lips. Strangely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no triumph in his heart, none</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fierce pleasure he'd dreamed of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">those dreary years. There was only dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgust, and the hint of a long-dead hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">for rest again. Rest, and the common</seg><seg type="columnLine">things of life on the Earth which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forbidden to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Woller could die before him now, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">HIGHWAYMAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he would be avenged. But Woller alive</seg><seg type="columnLine">could say the words that would wipe out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the banishment, would return him to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green star that was home. Woller could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be made to confess--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I ought to blast you now," lie said in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a soft, chill tone that was like a whip</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Woller, jerking him upright. "I ought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to, and I will if I must But you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">live if you want to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Woller was licking his lips, his face a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mask, only his panic-stricken eyes alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can live," Nolan repeated. "A</seg><seg type="columnLine">full statement about the Junta frame, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">writing. Write it out and thumbprint it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we'll telestat it to the nearest TPL</seg><seg type="columnLine">station. Then you can have the lifeboat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Woller, and as much of a stare as TPL</seg><seg type="columnLine">gives you. Are you willing to pay that</seg><seg type="columnLine">much for your life, Woller?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Woller's lips were stiff but he forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words through. "Go to hell."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan nodded, and the deadly weariness</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled down over him again. "I see your</seg><seg type="columnLine">point, of course," he said slowly. "Tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet doesn't come out here much and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man is reasonably safe from them. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Woller -- power's your life blood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And a man on the run can't have much</seg><seg type="columnLine">power. I know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His finger curled on the trigger of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pyro and Woller, staring avidly, des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perately, whitened at the mouth. His lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved as though about to form words--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolan's trigger-sharp senses caught a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hint of movement behind him. Fool] he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought desperately. The doorf He tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hurl his body aside, out of the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the door that opened behind him. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he couldn't do that and keep the pyro</seg><seg type="columnLine">leveled on the two men at the desk. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Woller, exultant hatred leaping into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his purpled face, plunging for a drawer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desk; saw the door opening and some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one stepping through. Then, just as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was leveling the gun on Woller again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw the flashing swing of the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in the room. Forgotten Vincennes</seg><seg type="columnLine">--with a heavy nightstone paperweight</seg><seg type="columnLine">held bludgeon-like in his hand, leaping in</seg><seg type="columnLine">at himl He had no chance even to try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to turn. The weight was coming down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the side of his head. AH he could do</seg><seg type="columnLine">was try to roll with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the momentum was immense and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy weight struck him down to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF THE VOID	107</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor, drove him headlong into uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness: . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SOMEBODY was kicking him. Nolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">groaned once, then compressed his lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he remembered where he was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He opened his eyes and rolled over.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The blubbery Venusian second was stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over him, face sullen but eyes glinting</seg><seg type="columnLine">with perverse pleasure. He raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy spaceman's boot again--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold it," said Woller from the desk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were still in the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Woller got up, came over, looking down</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Nolan. His bearing was confident</seg><seg type="columnLine">again; he exuded an aura of brutal power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You should have killed me, Nolan," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "You only get the one chance, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan silently pushed himself erect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His ribs were agonized where the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">had booted them, and a blinding throb in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skull reminded him of the captain's</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow. He was conscious that his armpit</seg><seg type="columnLine">holster hung light. The pyro was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vincennes had left. Only Woller and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Venusian second were in the cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him. "My only doubt," Woller was</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying, "is whether to blast you now or</seg><seg type="columnLine">save you for a little later, when I'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">more time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," said Nolan tonelessly. "If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">want my vote, it's for now. Get it over</seg><seg type="columnLine">with."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Woller nodded. "That would be much</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasanter for you. I think I'll save you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He nodded slowly. Then, to the mate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Take him below!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back down the corridor, the mocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars still bright through the crystal un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derfoot Back and down, till they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the grav room, where the pulsing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whining generators spun their web of anti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravitational power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We don't have a brig," the mate apol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ogized. "But I think this will hold you</seg><seg type="columnLine">in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eyes warily on Nolan, he circled him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and opened a round metal door. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unused storeroom, bare except for rows</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vacant metal shelves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In you go," said the Venusian, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolan complied. The door slammed be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind him and was bolted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was a whine in the air, he noticed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The singing of the grav-generators It</seg><seg type="columnLine">108	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was not unpleasant ... at least, not un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearable, he corrected himself. But how</seg><seg type="columnLine">it persisted! It was constant as the keen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of a jammed frequency-modulator,</seg><seg type="columnLine">high as the wail of a banshee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He let his aching body slip to the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay there without even trying to think.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He raised his head for a searching second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there was nothing to see. Bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls, bare shelves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was helpless. His chance might come</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the second let him out. Till then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When had he slept last? Save for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes of unconsciousness, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily thirty hours. He pillowed his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his arm. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He moved his head uncomfortably, bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowed his ear deeper into his biceps. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">damned keening! He shifted restlessly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped his exposed ear with his other</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. That movement racked the beaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribs, but the shrilling, soft and remorseless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept on. It was enough to drive a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad ! It was--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat bolt upright, eyes flaring angrily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was what Woller had planned!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was torture--subtie, undramatic, sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple. But pure, horrid torture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan's face was gray with strain. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was incredible that a sound, a noise, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">become a threat. He'd heard the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound a million times before, though never</seg><seg type="columnLine">at such close range, or from such titanic</seg><seg type="columnLine">generators. But now--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He began trying to fill his mind with</seg><seg type="columnLine">other things, but there was no room for</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought in a brain that was brimming with</seg><seg type="columnLine">naked sound. Snatches of school-days</seg><seg type="columnLine">poetry, long columns of multiplication</seg><seg type="columnLine">tables-- They jumbled in his brain. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines ran together and muddled, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowned out by the wail of the generators.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He gave up and sat there, forcing himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be still, while the sound hovered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the atmosphere all around him, his jaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles taut enough to bite through steel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great pulse pounding in his temples. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flesh could stand only so much. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">a while--he didn't know when--he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercifully unconscious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A VOLCANO erupted under him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">awoke. His whole body was a mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flame now, head throbbing like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jets of a twenty-ton freight skid, chest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and ribs as sore as though they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">flayed. A sickening weight held him</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed against the metal floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The roaring from without was the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rockets, loud enough to drown out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whine that had nearly killed him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship was landing. And at once there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gentle jar, then a dizzying vertigo as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grav-web was cut off abruptly. The rock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ets died down and were silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything was silent. The change was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fantastic, a dream. Nolan, lying there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought the silence was the finest thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had ever heard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It didn't last. There were footsteps</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside, and the Venusian second mate</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered. "On your feet," he said curtly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The boss is ready for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan stood up cautiously. His feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">were shaky, but he could use them. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped over the rounded sill and followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Venusian's directions. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in the corridor, some of them in heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">suits. Nolan wondered where they were.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune was on the other side of the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">--could they be as far in as Uranus? How</seg><seg type="columnLine">long had he been unconscious!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get moving," repeated the second, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolan moved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blessed stillness! He was grinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself as he walked along the corridor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening for the lethal whine that wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">there any more. When they got to where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Woller, space-suited and bloated, was di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">recting a crew of men in the moving of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bulky object, Woller noted the grin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was not pleased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Enjoying yourself, Nolan?" he asked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsmiling. "That will have to stop."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A grin stayed on Nolan's face, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not the same one. It was a savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">threat. Woller looked at it, and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stand him over in the corner," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Venusian second. "I'll attend to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him right away. Business first."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second jerked a thumb at the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner formed by the airlock door and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of the corridor. Nolan looked in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction indicated, and a sudden tic in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brows showed a thought that had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. The red signal light winked out</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he watched; the inner door had closed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stared through the transparency at</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was beyond. Darkness was all he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see--darkness, and the light-dotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">HIGHWAYMAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">outline of buildings in the distance. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the lock was something that looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a skid, with men's figures around it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His forehead puckered, and his eyes re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the signal light, now dark--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Venusian second watched Nolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">limp slowly over to the indicated posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. His eyes narrowed. "Hey, what's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter?" he asked surlily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan shook his head. "Something in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my shoe," he said. He halted and bal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anced himself on one foot, poking into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">offending footgear. "A button, I guess,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said as drew out, concealed, something</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he knew quite well was not a button.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He breathed a silent prayer, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered. The Venusian grunted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned away. Nolan walked quickly over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the wall, by the lock light, turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood surveying the scene without interest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His hands apparently were linked idly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind him--but behind his back they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving swiftly, dexterously. A clink of</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass sounded, and Nolan winced as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp sliver cut his thumb. Then he stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless, waiting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men were shock-wrapping a long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">casket-like object. To judge by the care</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were using, the contents were deli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate and the handling would be rough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolan noted absently. Explosives, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last loop of elastic webbing went</seg><seg type="columnLine">around it, and the Venusian second pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">it taut. "All right," he grunted. "Take</seg><seg type="columnLine">it away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lock!" bawled Woller as the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up the bundle.

Still it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck, pure and simple, that gave him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to open the signal light socket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">take out the lume and put the pyro pellet</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the contacts. When he'd got out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of range and the automatic warning as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lock opened had touched it off--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Catastrophe.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">others hadn't And so the others were</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He grabbed a pyro from a writhing</seg><seg type="columnLine">wretch on the floor--there was horror in</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as he saw the seared face that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">once been that of the Venusian second.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He picked a heat suit out of the cubby,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was into it and in the lock before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinded men who had escaped the full</seg><seg type="columnLine">flare could recover themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lock doors took an eternity to work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but at last he was out in the cold, black</seg><seg type="columnLine">open.

That was all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man was just coming out of the skid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps twenty feet away. Nolan clicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his radio, waited for the inevitable</seg><seg type="columnLine">question--but it didn't come. The man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">transparent faceplate merely turned incuri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously to Nolan for a second, then bent to</seg><seg type="columnLine">examination of the fastenings of the skid's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock. Nolan turned calmly and strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">off along the side of the ship. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he rounded the stern he broke into a run,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heading straight out across charred earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a chajn of hummocks that promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How long would pursuit be delayed?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Late or soon, it would come.

He saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly round spot of brilliance fall on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side of the ship, then dance away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through the ice-clear Plutonian night he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make out the figure of a man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hand light scanning the belly of the ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking to see if Nolan had hidden him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self there. They would quickly learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">the answer to that--and know what he.</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond the ship were a few dim lights,</seg><seg type="columnLine">distorted by a crystal dome. It was an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other city--or not quite a city, but a domed</seg><seg type="columnLine">settlement out here in the wilderness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without warning a sun blossomed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side of the ship. Nolan stood frozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a split second, then dropped, cursing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They'd seen him, somehow, had turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship's powerful landing beam on him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But how?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A soundless bolt of lightning that</seg><seg type="columnLine">splashed against a higher hill behind him</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove speculation out of his mind. Nolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">frowned. The ship was armed--he hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">known that. Installation of pyros in inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetary craft was the most forbidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of the starways. But there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">time for wonder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As another blast sheared off the crest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a hill, Nolan, keeping low, scuttled</seg><seg type="columnLine">away behind the shelter of the hummocks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His only safety was in flight. Armor</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had none.

He risked a quick look, saw noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, retired behind the shelter of the hill</seg><seg type="columnLine">to consider. They'd suspended fire--did</seg><seg type="columnLine">they think him dead? Did they know he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had escaped?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Or was there a hidden danger in this?</seg><seg type="columnLine">It might be a ruse. They could be wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for him to move, to show himself. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan shivered, and absently turned up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heat control of his suit. He felt sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly hopeless. One man against--what?</seg><seg type="columnLine">His thoughts, unbidden, reverted to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl he had left in Avalon, and to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sordid fear that she might be what she</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed. Nolan's cheek muscles drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight, and his face hardened. Woller,</seg><seg type="columnLine">partly protected by his heat suit, undoubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly had lived through the instant inferno</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the pyro charge went off. That</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was one more thing against him--the girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolan sighed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And a faint reverberation on the soles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his feet brought him stark upright,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring frantically over the sheltering</seg><seg type="columnLine">mound of ice. A skid was racing down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before he could move its light flared</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, spotted him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And a tiny voice within his helmet said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't move, Nolan. You can't get away</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. You'll die if you try.

But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hulking Earthman with the pyro who stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his side, and lean black Captain Vin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cennes at the controls, were eyes enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I wish I could see you myself,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Woller said softly, his fingers drumming</seg><seg type="columnLine">idly against the wide fabric arm of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cushioned passenger's chair. "The ship's</seg><seg type="columnLine">surgeon says it may be weeks before I see</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. If I could afford to keep you</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive that long--" He sighed regretfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No, I can't afford it," he concluded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There are more important things, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing--" his voice shook but kept its</seg><seg type="columnLine">chill calm -- "that would give me more</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure than to see you die."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We could save him, Woller," Vincen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nes said. "Pickle him in a sleep-box</seg><seg type="columnLine">like--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Be still, Vincennes!" Woller's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sharp. "I'll ask for advice when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sleep-box--Nolan remembered sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly* what they were. Small coffins, large</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for a man, equipped with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic-powered generator that kept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupant in a sort of half-death, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing or able to move, but capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of existing almost indefinitely without</seg><seg type="columnLine">food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan wondered absently what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were doing with sleep-boxes, then gave it</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. It didn't matter. He cursed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carelessness that had led him to leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio on in his suit. It had been simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the Dragonfly's radio-man to tune in</seg><seg type="columnLine">HIGHWAYMAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on its carrier wave, get a radio fix on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The skid swerved abruptly in a sloppy</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn, and the surly earth man at the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trols halted it and looked around. "Okay,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he grunted. "Here we are."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Woller nodded. "Take me out," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered. "Nolan, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan peered out the window. Absorbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in self-recrimination, he hadn't paid at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention to their trip. He was surprised</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find gleaming metal all around the skid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were in a heat lock--they had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the domed settlement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Martian Vincennes went first. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as the pressure gauge showed he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">safely outside the Earthman gestured to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolan. He wedged himself wearily into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air chamber, closed the door. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for a break when the outer portal</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened . . . but there was no break. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Vincennes and his ready pyro there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Woller, stumbling and cursing, followed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Earthman. Vincennes opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main lock and they went into the dome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were two great ships inside, dimly</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted by a string of pale lumes overhead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolan looked at the mass of them, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rodlike projections clustered around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose, and knew them for what they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warships!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scaffolding was still around them. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not yet ready for launching, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for whatever mission of treason</seg><seg type="columnLine">Woller had planned them for. But by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">look of them the day was close. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolan was--awaiting execution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One look at Woller's iron countenance</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the tape showed that. Vincennes'</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, tight-knuckled around the butt of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun, was ample confirmation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the moment had not yet come.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Woller said, "Are they waiting?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vincennes' glance sped to a lighted door</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the far side of the hangar. "Looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">that way," he said. "Shall I attend to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolan first? He's tricky--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Woller laughed softly. "He's used up</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his tricks. We'll take him with us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive. He might come in handy.

"Let's go," he said. "We can't keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chief waiting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOLAN was first through the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was in a small room where four</seg><seg type="columnLine">or five ordinary-looking people were sit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing around at ease. One was in uniform,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others the perfect example of quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">successful businessmen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is he here yet?" whispered Woller.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Martian looked around the room be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not yet. Cafferty--Lieutenant Brie--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Searle--Vremczyk. That's all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dumpling - shaped soldier in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray-green of Pluto's militia stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Woller. "What the devil's the matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">with your face?" he spluttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Woller answered before Vincennes</seg><seg type="columnLine">could. "I had an accident, Brie," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped. "Keep your fat nose out of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dumpling turned purple. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said nothing, and Nolan realized Woller's</seg><seg type="columnLine">importance in this gathering. This gather-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of--what?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan looked around quickly, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer raced to his brain. An officer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pluto's defense forces--two or three well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed men, apparently wealthy, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">something about them that shrieked</seg><seg type="columnLine">"politico"--and Woller, once overlord of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the System's greatest news-dissemination</seg><seg type="columnLine">agency, still a man of vast influence. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like the back room of a political</seg><seg type="columnLine">convention--or the gathering of a cabal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Junta!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had to be the Junta.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What they were saying began to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense. A tall man in dove gray was</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're not satisfied, candidly," he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying. "Woller, you've had more money</seg><seg type="columnLine">than our resources can afford. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing you've asked for you got. And what</seg><seg type="columnLine">have you to show for it? Three ships--</seg><seg type="columnLine">not one of them fit to fly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Woller laughed contemptuously. "Can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">didly, Cafferty," he mimicked, "I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">care how you feel. My money's gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">right along with yours.

The door opened with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out warning, and another man entered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What he looked like Nolan could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess. He wore a heat suit with the hel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">met down. The polar-plastic faceplate</seg><seg type="columnLine">was set for one-way vision. Even his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice was muffled and distorted as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are we all here?" he asked. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">others seemed to note nothing odd about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his incognito--did he always disguise him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, Nolan wondered? "Where's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Orlando?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brie answered. "He was on Mars, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other side of the sun.

Then it turned toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolan. "What's this?" he asked, ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vancing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vincennes gestured with the pyro. "His</seg><seg type="columnLine">name is Nolan," he said. "He tried to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough with Mr. Woller. He's dangerous."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dangerous!" The blurred voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry. "Then why is he here?

Give me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">pyro!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was it, Nolan knew, and he tensed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his body for the leap he had to attempt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he knew it was useless. The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the heat suit reached for Vincennes'</seg><seg type="columnLine">pyro. In the moment while the gun was</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing from hand to hand there might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a chance. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were shouts from outside, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound of running feet.

Now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brie, dazed for a second, sprang to</seg><seg type="columnLine">obey. Then he turned, his plump, pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">face damp with sudden sweat. "What is</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, Chief?" he asked. "Are we--is there</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chief! thought Nolan. So this hooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger was the leader of the conspiracy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Masked, disguised like the bandit chief of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flamboyant operetta.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Chief was laughing. "Lots of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble," he answered. The dull shouting</seg><seg type="columnLine">from outside continued, rising to a cres-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cendo as whoever was without pounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the door and found it locked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then abruptly it subsided. The huge tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen on the desk buzzed sharply. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid little man seated beside it auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matically clicked the switch that turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">it on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Turn it off!" bellowed the man in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat suit. But it was already working.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The prismatic flare on the screen showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">no vision impulses were coming in, showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that whoever was calling was using a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound transmitter only -- a portable set</seg><seg type="columnLine">like those in a heat suit. A voice said</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Attention, Junta!

Nothing else--and his search was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thorough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All set," he reported.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good enough.

Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside will take their chances."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan raced to comply. The stillness</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the door was menacing. While he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dragging the suits out, throwing them</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the men, while they were putting them</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, the man called Searle was staring at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the masquerader with dawning compre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hension.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you going to do?" he whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered.

At five the gaunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leted left hand came up to the butt of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pyro, worked the tiny chambering lever</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a dozen times.

And still Nolan didn't know who</seg><seg type="columnLine">his savior was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, now," he panted over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet phone. "Give. Who are you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The answer was a chuckle, mixed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasping as the smaller man strove to match</seg><seg type="columnLine">his speed. "Tell you later," he panted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold it!" Nolan broke in, suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">recalling the oversight that had been so</seg><seg type="columnLine">disastrous before. "Don't tell me.

They've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got tracers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE was a snort of sudden compre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hension from the phone, then silence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolan looked to see the figure spurt into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lead, gesture ahead. They were round-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the dome. The bulk of the Dragonfly</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared, with a big cargo skid drawn up</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside it. The gesticulating arm of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other man pointed directly at it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan glanced around.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen of them there had been, hulking</seg><seg type="columnLine">brutes from the flight sheds of a system's</seg><seg type="columnLine">blowsiest ports, and one man in a heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit, faceplate mirrored like that of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man Nolan ran beside. It is not pleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see a strong man try to shriek in agony,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fail because the air has bubbled from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lungs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The outer door of the skid was open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the impostor trotted in. When Nolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beside him he leaned on the lock</seg><seg type="columnLine">control. Ever so slowly, the outer door</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed; slowly the inner opened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They burst into a chamber where a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just rising from a telescreen, face</seg><seg type="columnLine">contorted with consternation and hate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand bringing up a pyro from a drawer in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chart table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pseudo-chief's gun spoke first, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head and shoulders of the other dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared in a burst of flame and sicken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing smoke. There was no time for</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicacy. Ruthlessly shoving the seared</seg><seg type="columnLine">corpse away, the stranger dove for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls, touched the jet keys.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ungainly skid shuddered, then drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward. The stranger opened all jets</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the limits of their power. Creaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">and groaning, the skid responded. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dial of the speed indicator showed mount-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing acceleration, far beyond what the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was designed for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan, clinging with one arm to a floor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolted chair, threw back his helmet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelled: "I'm ready any time!

Who the devil are you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The impostor waved a hand impatiently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His muffled voice came: "Take a look in</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. There may be more aboard!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan grimaced and nodded. He picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way over the jolting floor, blaster out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the threshold. His groping hand en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countered the lume switch, flooded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cargo hatch with light. It was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty. A few crates, the long casket-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like object he had seen in the ship. Noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing behind which a man could hide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan turned to see the masquerader</seg><seg type="columnLine">unzipping the folds of his heat suit with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand while he guided the careening</seg><seg type="columnLine">skid with the other. He brought out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">114	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny black box, opened it to show a key</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a lever. He thumbed the lever open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">braced the box between his knees, began</seg><seg type="columnLine">tapping the key rhythmically. A curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrill staccato came from the box. Dee</seg><seg type="columnLine">dideedeedit didideedit deedeedit deedeedee</seg><seg type="columnLine">didee didididit--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a second he stopped, waited.

Satisfied, the man closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the box, slowed the skid to a point where</seg><seg type="columnLine">its guidance no longer required complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention. They had reached the ring of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice hummocks that surrounded Woller's</seg><seg type="columnLine">dome. The skid bounded over the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise, zoomed through that trough and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next; then the man kicked the rudder jets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It spun along the trough to where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hummocks were highest; then he cut the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned to Nolan, threw back his</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God/' gasped Nolan. "Pete!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PETERSEN grinned. "You called it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy," he admitted. "Don't I get around</seg><seg type="columnLine">though ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan closed his eyes and tightened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip on the back of his chair. "The story,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "Quick."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peterson shrugged. "How can I tell it</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick? It's long. . .

"I always did think you knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much for a guy that made his living</seg><seg type="columnLine">at cards."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Petersen laughed. "My biggest trouble,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said wryly. "I can't win at cards.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whatever I do. It's been quite a draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to my career.

I had to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the move."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan's brain was beginning to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. "But listen," he said. "How come</seg><seg type="columnLine">you didn't turn me in when you picked me</seg><seg type="columnLine">up--right after I escaped? If you worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the Law--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Petersen's face grew serious.

We weren't plan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning to keep you in jail, Steve. Any fool</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see you were being framed--fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">court, semi-pro witnesses. But TPL</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't step in, out in the open. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know enough for a showdown. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were going to be summoned to Mars</seg><seg type="columnLine">for further questioning. When we found</seg><seg type="columnLine">out all you knew you were to be taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">care of some way or other. Given a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">identity, kept undercover until we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to move."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I jumped the gun."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Petersen nodded. "I was in the neigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">borhood, heading for Earth. The TPL</seg><seg type="columnLine">man on the ship called Earth Base; they</seg><seg type="columnLine">called me. The ship had you spotted, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they decided not to pick you up. Base</seg><seg type="columnLine">figured that if you thought you were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunted you'd keep yourself under cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we wouldn't have to bother. And if</seg><seg type="columnLine">I picked you up I could pump you myself."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolan grinned. "How did you do?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Fine. You talked more than a ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">triloquist with a two-tongued dummy. . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then you turn up on Pluto, just when</seg><seg type="columnLine">things are getting hot."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After three years of hiding in third-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grade ratholes for fear of the law." There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no bitterness in Nolan's voice. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">a calm statement of an unpleasant fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">Petersen's voice was level, too, but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were alert as he watched Nolan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That couldn't be helped, Steve. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what was at stake."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abruptly the grin returned. "The whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">damned System, that's all," Nolan said a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little proudly. "Well ... go ahead with</seg><seg type="columnLine">your story."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Petersen shrugged. He looked a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">relieved as he spoke. "You know most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Oh--one part you don't know. Wol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ler's daughter--her name's Ailse--knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">about what he was doing. She just found</seg><seg type="columnLine">out about it. We had a maid working in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her home in Aylette--she didn't generally</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay with Woller; they didn't get along."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolan's brows lifted. "Oh ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yep. Ailse was worried silly. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">even talked to the maid--not much, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough that we could figure out what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">happening. It seemed she was going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">confront Woller with what she knew, try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to talk him out of treason."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A real good idea," Nolan remarked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Knowing Woller--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">HIGHWAYMAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's how we knew where this base</seg><seg type="columnLine">was.

Who is this Chief you were sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to be ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PETERSEN frowned. "Don't know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly," he admitted. "There are three</seg><seg type="columnLine">men it could be--they're all connected with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Junta, we're pretty sure. They're all</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Saturn, and we got word that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rendezvousing here. We knew the boss</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept his identity hidden by wearing this</seg><seg type="columnLine">get-up, so I was detailed to cut in."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolan nodded. Then, his thoughts re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verting, he said. "Where's the--where's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ailse now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Petersen looked unhappy. "Uh--I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. After you left we sent for her, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see what she knew that might help. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">maid went after her--and couldn't find</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. She'd gone out of town, wasn't ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected back for some time. We couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait. All the leaders of the Junta meeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">here--it was too big a chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan said, "Well, what are we doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it? They're all there, and they're</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned. And we're out here, parked on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of nowhere, waiting for them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get up a scout party and grab us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Petersen turned to look out the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the direction of the dome. He scanned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skies carefully, then pursed his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, no, Steve," he said, pointing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Take a look."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arrowing lines of fire were swooping</seg><seg type="columnLine">down from far into the blackness. Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">trails of white flame showed where three</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships were plummeting to the surface. No-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lan turned to Petersen with a startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">question in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Watch," Petersen advised. "This'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth seeing!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down and down they drove, faster than</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteor ever fell. A mile above the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jets behind died, and yellow flame burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of them, flaring quickly to white.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They slowed, poised, and then, in perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">unison, spun off to one side. They came</seg><seg type="columnLine">around in a great circle and dived at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground again. And repeated the operation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And abruptly Nolan saw what was hap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF THE YOID	115</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pening. He was witnessing the systematic</seg><seg type="columnLine">annihilation of the domed settlement! Im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense bursts of fire from ship-sized pyros</seg><seg type="columnLine">were blazing into the ground. The hum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mocks prevented a clear view, but Nolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see from the reflected glare on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountainsides behind that the destruction</seg><seg type="columnLine">was frightful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I called them," Petersen said softly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You saw me call them. That black box</seg><seg type="columnLine">--it's a telesonde."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan didn't turn, fascinated by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight. "What's a telesonde?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">absently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A radio that carries neither voice nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision.

The ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">came around again, and down. This time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forward jets were delayed. When they</seg><seg type="columnLine">flared out they persisted, while the ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped gently out of sight. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The destruction of the dome was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nolan turned away.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at Petersen.

"Woller mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried a widow. A wealthy one, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter. They didn't get along too well.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The woman died.

Everyone seems to give their reasons for reading</seg><seg type="columnLine">Planet so I might as well bore you with mine. I believe in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I've been reading this type of magazine I have read at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">three times every one of them to appear on the market. So nat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">urally when I first saw good old Planet I bought a copy to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it was like. As you've been told numerous times before</seg><seg type="columnLine">your first issues were not so hot. And the only reason, at first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I continued to purchase it was due entirely to the Vizigraph.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now it is as much for the stories as the Viz. that I get every</seg><seg type="columnLine">copy I can.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Enough preliminaries have been indulged in for me to come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meat of the matter. Mainly to what you owe this great</seg><seg type="columnLine">honor? It's this guy, E. F. Buchanon. On a couple of points I</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe he is right referring to his bit concerning the artists,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">117</seg><seg type="columnLine">118	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which, as I know nothing about art other than I</seg><seg type="columnLine">either like or dislike, I won't take up much time</seg><seg type="columnLine">with. But to say that none of them (Vizi fans)</seg><seg type="columnLine">know nothing about art is, I believe, a grave error.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After all there are some people who have studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">art, but do not make a living at it, and others who</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a hobby of art. And, to me, it doesn't seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all illogical for some of them to read fiction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Or even to write fan letters. Now to the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">point on which I agree (slightly). That is his</seg><seg type="columnLine">paragraph on hack. But then not everyone can</seg><seg type="columnLine">write stories. Still, active criticism has a ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dency (no matter how it's delivered) to increase</seg><seg type="columnLine">an author's efforts to increase the quality of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories to an extent that the word "hack" shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be applied to any work of his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now for his panning the fans. After all isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">that what the Viz. and similar departments in</seg><seg type="columnLine">other mags are for? To procure the reader's</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinion of the material he has to read? And if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they get a kick out of ribbing each other and hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a little innocent fun, let them. It does no</seg><seg type="columnLine">harm and I, for one, enjoy reading them. E. F. B.</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have had a disagreeable experience with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fans to have such a sour and near-sighted opinion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them. Also from the sound of his letter he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have come off second best. Maybe that's why</seg><seg type="columnLine">he no longer edits that magazine he seems so</seg><seg type="columnLine">proud of.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This ish of PS was really superb. Let's have</seg><seg type="columnLine">more stories like Leigh Brackett's "Jewel of Bas."</seg><seg type="columnLine">For some strange reason I have a liking for this</seg><seg type="columnLine">type of novel. I always enjoy Bond. Enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. Two shorts "And the Gods Laughed'' by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fredric Brown and "The Avenger** by Stuart</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fleming make a photo finish for third. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">both well written and interesting right up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last paragraph. I won't attempt to rate the illus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trations. As I said before they don't affect me</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside of like or dislike. For those who do value</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, however, give No. 1 to Bill Watson. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">has lots of sound ideas better expressed than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">majority.

Funda-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentally, you have a fine magazine although you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are spoiling it with all the putrid trash you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">putting into it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Take the Spring Issue for example. There is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sample of what I mean. The only story that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth the paper it is printed on is Nelson S.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bond's novel Wanderers of the Wolf Moon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even that could have been better. Miss Brackett's</seg><seg type="columnLine">novel was a disappointment to say the least. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shorts!

Therefore, I shall say no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more about them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cover? It was the sloppiest looking thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've ever seen on any magazine.

Not that it was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad. A fair cover. Usual fair stories. Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">exceptional.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ah, but the Fall number. That I must con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cede was very good with these successful stories:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1.	Thralls of the Endless Night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 2.

Phantom Out of Time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the cover. Well that was something after</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own heart</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now I want you to understand. The fact is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would like to see Planet Stories up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world of science-fiction. So I have deigned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give a few suggestions. Behold I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1.	How about a backcover illustration on every</seg><seg type="columnLine">issue. For instance, you could have artists give</seg><seg type="columnLine">their versions of people of other worlds or even</seg><seg type="columnLine">illustrate one of the other stories in the magazine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 2.	Use some good authors, not these amateurs</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you have been doing. By good authors I mean:</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bond, Brackett, Binder, Repp, Ayre, Williams,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rocklynne, and Kummer. Of course many ama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teurs do turn out good stories too, but let's not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have too many.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 3.	Print a special big issue of perhaps 200 pages</seg><seg type="columnLine">or more every once in a while. What if it costs</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few cents more. (No paper. Ed.)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 4.	Go bi-monthly. (Ditto. Ed.)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 5.	Use Lynch, Paul, Morey, Ingels and Leyden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">frost frequently. Maybe a little of Bok.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 6.	How about a two part serial by Bond or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 7.	Let's have more inside illustrations. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to see what we're reading about looks like</seg><seg type="columnLine">on paper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 8.	On the contents page give the name of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">artist who painted the story and tell what story it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is portraying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 9.	Use some character like the Space Falcon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Gene Hunter suggested to build up a series.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 10.	Make the pictures and stories correspond</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the stories. On the newsstand, for instance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our eye is caught by the picture of the beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">heroine struggling in the grasp of some terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster while the big, brave, handsome hero</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes battling: to the rescue. So we buy the</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazine mainly to see what happens. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what do we do? We hunt through the book and</seg><seg type="columnLine">come out sadly disillusioned because we found</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing that even hinted anything of the dashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 11.	Have more love interest in your stories.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's what makes them more enjoyable. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean the silly mushy kind, but the decent read-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able type.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 12.	Keep some of the far-fetched junk out. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">that complicated stuff that doesn't make an iota</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sense isn't worth reading.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I hope that after all this work you will at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least make use of some of my criticisms and put</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to some purpose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In closing, I must again repeat that there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly room for improvement. To console you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will add that there is still some hope and if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">see even a little improvement I may continue to</seg><seg type="columnLine">read your periodical.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Sincerely yours,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Kathleen Maunsbach.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE VIZIGRAPU	119</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CRUSADING LESSER!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                        2302 Avenue O,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                        Brooklyn, New York.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dear Editor:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not since Loyal M.

Wanderers of the Wolf Moon took first place</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a long shot. Yes, it is really good. I became</seg><seg type="columnLine">so interested in it that I stayed up until 2:00 one</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning just so I could finish it.

The Avenger, what a luscious beginning, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ending. Those stories with the gore are the ones</seg><seg type="columnLine">that usually interest me mostly. How about more</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these reet stories by Fleming?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 3.	The Jewel of Bas, rather interesting, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been better. Did not make much sense. Kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fuddled up. Brackett has done far better.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 4.	And the Gods Laughed took fourth because</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a little different than most of the P. S.</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories. I like this Brown, guy, also the artist</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clyne, more of him and less of Ingels would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped this edition ever so much.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rest just came, and I won't rate them, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause I consider them just stories, not worth the</seg><seg type="columnLine">everlasting comments they will probably get.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I still like Doolin, better than any of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">artists, he has something that some of these art-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ists will never get, a neat style that can never</seg><seg type="columnLine">be touched. It is jivie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Where is Kuttner? I was shocked to see an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other issue of P. S. without Kuttner.

I refer to The Star Guards-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, by Albert De Pina. This seems to be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time that this author has appeared in Planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">by himself, and he comes up to my expectations</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him after reading Star of Panadur and Alca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traz of the Stanvays. Although by no stretch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the imagination could he be said to use a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">action and strife, he has done something else. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">has in The Star Guardsman really accomplished</seg><seg type="columnLine">a psychological novel, which is something far too</seg><seg type="columnLine">rare in science fiction. The author has the gift</seg><seg type="columnLine">of drawing his characters with such precision,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they walk right out of the pages of Planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stories. His vivid descriptions are so fresh and</seg><seg type="columnLine">original that they match his grasp of narrative.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now that I have read two of his stories in col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboration, and this novel of his own, I can say</seg><seg type="columnLine">that as a fiction writer of "other world" stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is unquestionably "GOOD."

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">time passes, and a magazine like everything else</seg><seg type="columnLine">begins to evolve.

And the policy must per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">force begin to change in accordance with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"readers' " desires, else the magazine gets into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rut. Time and again, many fans and readers have</seg><seg type="columnLine">begged for more science and less plain adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">translated into other worlds--less hacky "blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thunder." Yet the editorial guidance has</seg><seg type="columnLine">not heeded the general outcry. Perhaps the pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure has not been sufficient to effect the change,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although The Star Guardsman seems to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeler to gauge the readers' and fans' reaction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just as Mr. William Conover's suggestion for off-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail stories has been left up to the fans.
