            <seg type="columnLine">out on the bay, starred with scattered</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">One certainly did grow ignorant down</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">under the Equator! He had naturally</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">was the mistress of the Steiner Street</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">house. Why ? Merely because she had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">looked it. But she could not have been,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">especially in view of the fact that she</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had received him in what was evidently</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a bare business office. She was a maid,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a servant. And this explained a tre-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mendous amount--her quietness, her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">restrained manner, her apparent dread</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of becoming excited by his news. She</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was a servant, afraid of disturbing her</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">into a household which knew her im-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">personally.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> "My word!" he said aloud to him-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">self. "Of course! And it makes it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">clear how Ames got acquainted with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her. She was a pretty servant, and he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">married her. Probably she thought</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">herself lucky to become the wife of a</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> This settled to his satisfaction, he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">decided that he hadn't done all that was</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Mathews, as she was known to her</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">know how to proceed in business</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">matters. She would need some one to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tell her about things, and guide her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">through the intricacies of legal forms</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and maritime regulations. Very pos-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sibly she had no male relatives</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at hand. She was undoubtedly without</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">money, except what she earned in her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">menial capacity. Ames was a brute,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">anyway, sending worthless pearls to a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wife who had had to go to work to</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">support herself. No wonder she had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shown dread at the thought of not hav-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> At this point Hendricks smiled</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">undutifully committing his family to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">limbo. "What did they ever do for</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> At first he decided to write Miss</seg>
