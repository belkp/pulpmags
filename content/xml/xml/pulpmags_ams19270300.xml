We have gone to a great expense to</seg><seg type="columnLine">adopt this excellent paper, which is much smoother</seg><seg type="columnLine">and prints very much better than our former art</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper, which some correspondents felt inclined to call "wrap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping paper." Of course the magazine does not bulk as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, and we have made .the change only because so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">people wrote us saying that they did not like the paper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A vote-taking among some 200 people brought out this sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prising result--over 190 were in favor of the new paper. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course this new paper costs us a lot more, but we want, first</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all to please you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">* * *â– </seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The above is the style in which this sort of thing is usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">dished-up by an up-to-date editor, but the plain and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">varnished truth is that the new paper costs less money than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old. You probably would not believe this, and class it as</seg><seg type="columnLine">an amazing story. Nevertheless, it does cost us less. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">we originally brought out Amazing Stories, we thought it</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary to hand you a big package for the money. Hence</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bulky paper, which was made specially for our require-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments. Such a paper had never been made before. Now it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">known as Amazing Stories Bulky Weave. We are sorry to</seg><seg type="columnLine">discontinue it, because we personally liked it. But we know</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will like the new paper, and that, after all, is what</seg><seg type="columnLine">counts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	* *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a correspondent remarked to us, the editor of Amazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stories does not lie on a bed of roses. Quite the contrary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bed is full of thorns, and if there are roses present, I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not give a scent for them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is the most difficult paper that it has been my good luck</seg><seg type="columnLine">to edit. The strange fact is that there are no two read-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers who like the same thing. It is astonishing that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voting coupons show that almost exactly 50 per cent of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">readers heartily dislike one story, whereas the other 50 per</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent laud the same story to the skies. Stories like "Station</seg><seg type="columnLine">X." "The Second Deluge," "The First Men in the Moon,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Red Dust," all were in this class. A great many read-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers wrote very complimentary remarks on these stories and</seg><seg type="columnLine">voted their preference for them, and almost exactly the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of readers denounced the same stories.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If you, dear reader, were the editor, what would your reac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion be to such a condition. Would you hesitate about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next story before publishing it, or would you simply throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself to the fishes and simultaneously throw up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponge?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I do neither. I simply keep right on smiling, because I</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem to have an idea in the back of my head which during</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">more lucid moments probably runs somewhat as follows:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here we have Amazing Stories, a totally new sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazine, different from any that has ever been published</seg><seg type="columnLine">anywhere so far.

Having made scientifiction a hobby since I was 8</seg><seg type="columnLine">years old, I probably know as much about it as any one, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the long run experience will teach just what type of story</seg><seg type="columnLine">is acclaimed by the vast majority. Give the readers the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">best type of stories that you can get hold of. Try out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best classics first, and get the readers' reactions. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazine has been published for a year, you will have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty good idea what sort of story makes the greatest ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the meanwhile, you are sailing uncharted seas, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">such you are apt to strike rocks once in a while, but if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">navigating is done skillfully, the magazine must keep afloat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The above is very likely what is happening, evidently we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not making a mess of it, because we are printing 150,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">copies at the present time, and the sales seem to be climbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">month after month.

We re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived no less than 360 manuscripts from all parts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. Of course, it was impossible, as yet, to read all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. The majority, however, have been quite good and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishing amount of ingenuity was shown.

Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if each one of our readers would call the attention of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend to Amazing Stories, we should soon be in a position</seg><seg type="columnLine">to add 50 per cent more text to the magazine.

I cannot force them. The law pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hibits any unusual or cruel infliction of the death</seg><seg type="columnLine">penalty and to send them to the Valley of the Rio</seg><seg type="columnLine">Infiernillo would fall under that prohibition."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The four men stood meditating in the Salle des</seg><seg type="columnLine">Armes.

So on the following day the expedition</seg><seg type="columnLine">set forth with the legs of the convicts chained under</seg><seg type="columnLine">their mules' bellies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ayacucho turned out en masse to watch the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parture of so distinguished a cavalcade, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might as well be admitted at once that none of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventurers made so brave a showing or saluted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the villagers with more graceful bows than did</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cesare Ruano or Pablo Pasca. In fact, they divided</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plaudits of the crowd about equally with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prefect, who kept murmuring to Pethwick:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a bad stroke, Sevor Pethwick, not a bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroke."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The legs of the convicts were chained, naturally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prevent any sudden leave-taking, but this plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">held disadvantages. When one of the llama packs</seg><seg type="columnLine">became loosened, either the scientists had to bungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">the job themselves or take the leg-cuffs off their</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners and allow them to dismount and do it for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. This entailed endless chaining and unchain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, which quickly grew monotonous and at length</seg><seg type="columnLine">was abandoned after the geographers had exacted</seg><seg type="columnLine">a solemn pledge of the two cutthroats not to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. That much of the contract the guides kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the letter. They never did run away, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">the company- lost them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> M. Demetriovich retained the manacles on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horn of his saddle, where, he told Pethwick, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped their jingle would have a great moral effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oddly enough both the convicts were entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">innocent of the charges preferred against them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon which they were convicted and so nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">executed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pablo Pasca told the whole circumstance to Peth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wick. He, Pablo, did meet an old man one freez-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing July night in a mountain pass on the road to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ayacucho. They stopped and held some converse and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pablo had borrowed from him two hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty-seven sols. Then what did this ingrate of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">creditor do but beat his head against a tree, break</seg><seg type="columnLine">an arm, go before a magistrado and charge Pasca</seg><seg type="columnLine">with highway robbery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pablo's black eyes flashed as he related the inci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent. He had been amazed at such calumny, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not disprove. The jury believed the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">wretch and sentenced Pablo to the garrote.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, the One Who Ruled the Earth knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the truth, and Pasca prayed every night that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should not have his spinal cord snapped on such an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unjust charge. So the One Who Ruled sent this</seg><seg type="columnLine">society of fine gentlemen and scholars to fraternize</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Pablo and to lift him to an exalted station.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">So he, Pablo, supposed now all the neighbors saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his oath, as strange as it sounded, was true</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the last jot and title. The padre in his visits to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the carcel had taught Pablo a little verse which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should never forget: "Seest thou a man diligent</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his profession--he shall sit before kings."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cesare Ruano did not go so much into detail as</seg><seg type="columnLine">did his fellow guide and friend, but he told Peth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wick that the crime for which he was sentenced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the garrote was trivial and with a shrug of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders let it go at that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The trivial affair, however, had left a number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of marks on Ruano's person, all of which the Aya-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cucho police had tabulated. A copy of this table</seg><seg type="columnLine">was given M. Demetriovich in order that he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">advertise for Cesare in case he should desert.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pethwick read the inventory. It ran:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cesare Ruano, a cholo, 27 years, reddish yellow, height</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 5ft. 7in., weight 84 kilos, (189 lbs), muscular, broad</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> face, prominent cheek-bones, straight nose with wide</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> nostrils, very white teeth, handsome.

Disposition uncommunicative, but of pleasant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> address and cheerful until irritated. A very handy man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Note: In case of arrest, officers are advised to shoot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> before accosting Ruano.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON the first few nights the travelers found</seg><seg type="columnLine">lodgings at little mountain inns, whose red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peaked roofs of tiles were pulled down like caps</seg><seg type="columnLine">over tiny eye-like windows. The tunnel-like en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance to such a hostelry always looked like a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth squared in horror at something it saw across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was much the same expression that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proprietor and guests wore when they learned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">travelers were bound for the Rio Infiernillo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pablo Pasca always broke the news of their des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tination in rather dramatic style to the gamesters</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hangers-on with which these centers of moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain life were crowded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sefiores," he would harangue, "you see before</seg><seg type="columnLine">you a man sentenced to death; but because no gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rote could affect his throat, so hard has it become</seg><seg type="columnLine">from drinking gin, the prefect decided to send him</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a journey to the Rio Infiernillo! Let us drink</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our good fortune!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This announcement usually brought roars of ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plause and laughter. Once a roisterer shouted:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But your companions; what caused them to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Pablo answered with a droll gesture:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One is a murderer; the rest are Americans!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It made a great hit. The crowd invited Pablo to</seg><seg type="columnLine">share its brandy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, after these introductions the landlord</seg><seg type="columnLine">would presently stop laughing and after some ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions invariably warn the scientists against their</seg><seg type="columnLine">"mad undertaking." On two such occasions the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proprietor became so earnest and excited that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">begged the sefiores to walk out with him up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain-side to see for themselves the terrors that</seg><seg type="columnLine">confronted them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pethwick never forgot his first glimpse of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">1090</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery that colored his thoughts and dreams for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the remainder of his life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The night was clear but moonless. The party</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed uncertainly in darkness up a scarp of</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulders and spurs of primitive rock. The landlord</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked his way toward a clump of calisaya trees sil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">houetted against the sky. The chill air was shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the fragrance of mountain violets. The climb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers lent each other hands until the landlord reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">a protruding root and then everybody scrambled up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pethwick dropped down breathless at the foot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tree, his heart beating heavily. At first he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintly amused at his host's promise of a portent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but this amusement vanished presently amid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solemnity of night and the mountains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The very stars above him wore the strange aspect</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Southern constellations. Against their glim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer the Andes heaved mighty shoulders. Peak be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond peak, they stood in cold blackness, made more</seg><seg type="columnLine">chill and mysterious by the pallor of snow-fields.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whole group shivered in silence for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes. At last M. Demetriovich asked with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shake in his Spanish:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, amigo, what is there to see?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait," began the landlord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that moment a star shot far out against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Alla!" gasped the Peruvian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pethwick shivered and grinned. He had brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">them up to see a shooting star.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But wait!" begged their host, sensing the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gineer's mirth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost at once from where the star seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike arose a faint, glowing haze as indefinite as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Milky Way. It must have been miles distant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In front of it two or three massifs were outlined</seg><seg type="columnLine">and others, farther away, were dimly truncated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by its radiance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hu6sped drew a long breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now there lies the Rio Infiernillo," he chattered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is a land from which no man returns alive.

'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is yours?" inquired Pethwick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sefiores," defined the tavern-keeper solemnly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that stream is called the Rio Infiernillo for a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">good reason.

No one</seg><seg type="columnLine">else heard him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was uttered with such solemnity that Peth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wick never knew whether it was an account of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird tragedy of the mountains or whether it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut out of whole cloth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night after Pethwick had gone to bed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper story of the hostelry, while the laughing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drinking flowed steadily below, it occurred to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that it was odd, after all, that the landlord</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have led them on such a clamber to see a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting star and a haze---and the two phenomena</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have occurred so promptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON the following night another landlord led</seg><seg type="columnLine">them out on the same mission and showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them the same set of wonders. His explanation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">even more fantastic than the first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before the party retired that second night, Peth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wick asked of M.

"In fact, I have set down some</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentative figures on the subject." Here he referred</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a little note-book. "It is roughly one chance in</seg><seg type="columnLine">two-million."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Small," observed Pethwick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was for the stars alone.

Pethwick looked ahead and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw two vultures launch themselves out over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">abyss. One swung back down the face of the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain and passed within forty feet of the party, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">feathers whistling, its bald, whitish head turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a look at the intruders and its odor momentarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainting the cold wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment later the engineer saw the two guides</seg><seg type="columnLine">had dismounted and their mules were snorting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerking on the very edge of the precipice. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">men themselves were staring at something and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pasca seemed almost as panic-stricken as the ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals. The unquietness spread rapidly down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">string of baggage-carriers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pethwick slid off his mount and hurried forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipping inside the llamas and dodging past the</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncertain heels of the mules. He came out by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of Pablo to a queer, not to say gruesome sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the air circled eight or ten vultures.

Among the things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pethwick recognized the whitened frames of snake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">condor, sheep, vicuna, puma, monkey and at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end, standing upright, the bones of a man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The specimens were accurately spaced around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the trail, for this was the last of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road. The skulls grinned fixedly at the DeLong</seg><seg type="columnLine">Geographical Expedition.

Far be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low them the tree line was marked by some small</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees that had been tortured by the wind into</seg><seg type="columnLine">grotesque shapes worked out by the Japanese in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their dwarf trees. Here and there patches of snow</seg><seg type="columnLine">disguised their precarious footing into white pit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">falls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mules crept downward, exploring every step</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the way with their little hoofs, then easing their</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight forward. It made a very swaying, chafing</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride. Pethwick's pommel worked against his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach until he felt he had been sitting down a</seg><seg type="columnLine">week, wrong side first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After an endless jostle it seemed to the engineer</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was not descending in the slightest, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being shaken back and forth, sticking in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">place amid the cyclopean scenery. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked back, the endless boulder-field slanted to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the sky; when he looked down, it seemed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as ever into the black and sinister valley where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river wound like an adder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked to reaching the tree-line with a hope it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would bring him relief from the monotony.

His saddle chafed, his mule sagged and swayed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His fellow-scientists did as he was doing, squirmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">about on the torturing saddle-horns. The sameness</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove his mind in on itself. He began as Cesare</seg><seg type="columnLine">had said, "to stare into his mule's ears and think."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wondered about the skeletons. He wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">what "trivial" thing Cesare had done to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">1094</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sentenced to the garrote. He wondered what that</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting star and the phosphorescent mist could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been? Then he wondered about the skeletons</seg><seg type="columnLine">again . . . about Cesare. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A rifle-shot that sounded like a mere snap in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin mountain air disturbed his reflections. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up and saw a faint wisp of vapor float out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the .30-30 in Cesare's hands. The engineer</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced anxiously to see if the murderer had shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of his companions. They were all on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">mules and all looking at each other and at him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every one in the crowd had felt instinctively that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desperado had fired at some person--possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at one of his own party.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?" cried Standifer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A man yonder!" Pablo pointed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know whether it was a man or not!" cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ruano, jumping from his slow mule and setting</seg><seg type="columnLine">off down the declivity at a hazardous run.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ruano!" shouted M.

Drop it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Extraordinary to say, Cesare did drop his gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as it struck the stones it fired again. The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged on downward at full tilt. It was an amaz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing flight. He took the boulders like a goat. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">party stopped their mounts and sat watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you say it was a man?" asked the secretary</seg><seg type="columnLine">shakily of Pablo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As sure as I am sitting here." At that moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flying Ruano swung in behind a large boulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He was behind that!" cried Pablo sharply. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he lifted his voice. "Did you get him, Cesare?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted. "Was there any money on him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But almost immediately Pethwick glimpsed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">murderer again, in fact saw him twice--or he may</seg><seg type="columnLine">have caught a flash of two figures, one chasing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SUDDENLY Pablo began yelling sis if on a fox-</seg><seg type="columnLine">course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A shock of horror went through Pethwick. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew too well what the convict would do if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the man.

"Lord, we ought not to have given</seg><seg type="columnLine">that brute a gun!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe he hit him!" surmised Pablo in cheerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's chasing him this minute somewhere behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">those boulders." declared Standifer nervously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> M.

They looked as if some object of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense heat had branded the mountain-side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ordinarily Pethwick's mind would have sprung</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a terrier at such a problem; now, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer brain fag, he jotted the descriptions without</seg><seg type="columnLine">comment. In this dull, soulless way he made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">following extraordinary entry in his journal one</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   This morning, close to one of those burned pockets,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  or fumaroles, which I have before described, I found</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  a roasted rabbit. The little animal was some twelve</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  feet from the fumarole, sitting upright on its haunches</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  and roasted. It looked as if its curiosity had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  aroused, and it had been cooked instantly. As decom-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  position had not set in, it could not have been dead</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  for more than a week.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I wonder if this is a tab on the date of these fum-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  aroles? If so, they must have been burned a few days</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ago, instead of being of geologic antiquity, as I at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  first assumed. If recent, they must be of artificial</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  origin. Since they roast a rabbit before frightening it,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  they must occur with the abruptness of an explosion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Can these splotches be connected with the evil mystery</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  surrounding this expedition? I cannot say, I have no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  theory whatever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT evening at dinner Pethwick showed this</seg><seg type="columnLine">entry to M.

However, he said noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about it, but remarked to M.

We are in the midst of a Radium</seg><seg type="columnLine">Age. It was developed out of the Uranium Age.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And that out of the Aluminum Age.

All the major pieces can move</seg><seg type="columnLine">up or down, forward or backward, but the pawns</seg><seg type="columnLine">can only advance, or go higher. As no real boards</seg><seg type="columnLine">are used, the whole play must be kept in mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The game becomes a contest of intricacy, that is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until one player grows confused, makes an inco-</seg><seg type="columnLine">herent move and is checkmated.

"I saw this fellow be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind this very boulder! This same fellow!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pethwick nodded in the sunlight, unaware that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pablo expected him to do anything. Indeed, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer was glad he had come out of the tent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Three's intelligence was oppressive. So now he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood breathing deeply, as if from some struggle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cliffs, the sunshine, the river, the savor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kitchen, almost made him doubt the existence in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tent of such a personage as Mr. Three from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Land of One. Where in Heaven's name was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">land? Did there flourish over behind the Andes</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere an unknown race of extraordinary arts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sciences who called themselves the First?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And there recurred to him his fancy that if such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a nation existed, it must be an offshoot of the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Incan race. Perhaps fugitives flying before the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">conquistadores found a haven in some spot and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had built up the most advanced civilization upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face of the earth. The thought was utterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">fantastic, and yet it was the only explanation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Three sitting there in the tent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" said Pablo interrogatively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineer came out of his reverie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is that all you wanted to tell me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All? Isn't that enough?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aren't you going to do anything?" demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pablo. "He is an Indian. I thought when Indians</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed any one the white men garroted them. Qwk!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like that!" He pinched his throat and made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">disagreeable sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What am I to do?" inquired Pethwick blankly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Blessed Virgin! Does not the white man's law</seg><seg type="columnLine">work in the Valley de Rio Infiernillo? I knock an</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man on the head and barely save my neck. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">cholo kills my good caviarada, wears his clothes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">steals the very ring Cesare meant to be garroted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, what happens to him? Why, he sits at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table with white men and plays! Ehue! A fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">justice!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineer hardly knew how to answer this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stood looking at Pablo rather blankly. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure an attempt to arrest Mr. Three would prove</seg><seg type="columnLine">perilous indeed. On the other hand, Pablo's atti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude demanded that Pethwick should act.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Isolated like this, Pethwick was the lone repre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentative of the great Anglo-Saxon convention of</seg><seg type="columnLine">justice. It is a strange convention that polices</seg><seg type="columnLine">every clime and every tongue.

The engineer got out just in time to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pablo go at full speed toward the enclosure. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian had a J'epeating rifle and no doubt feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attack of a puma or jaguar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On Pethwick's heels came both M.

Along the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the river slunk a panther, making cat-like rushes</seg><seg type="columnLine">between hiding-places. The shrill whistle of three</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened deer sounded down the valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It seemed as if a wave of fear were depopulating</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole Rio Infiernillo. All the engineer could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">was innumerable furtive .dodgings. From the dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the river arose a loon, screaming, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it boomed down stream with fear-struck speed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only one animal fled in the open, a huge black bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a white muzzle, the ucumari. He was king of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Andes, as the grizzly reigns in the Rockies. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunged down the middle of the canon, taking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole Infernal Valley for his course. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid of nothing in the Sierras--except what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The scientists hurried out from in front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brute and let him lunge by unchallenged.

The distant fleas</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew into bugs, then into some sort of animals and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last were defined against the charnel gulch as</seg><seg type="columnLine">human beings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jumping Jehosophat!" cried Standifer.

The very</seg><seg type="columnLine">vicunas themselves that skittered along the craggy</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides of the valley did not exhibit a greater agility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pablo Pasca, notwithstanding his belief that all</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was a great drive of the devil, nevertheless be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came excited at the passing game.

The head of the gun wavered about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big painted head. With a determined effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engineer settled it on his target.

The mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious burned places which Pethwick had noted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his journal were spots where the furnace had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">operated. The strange lights which the expedition</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen on several occasions were the men moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">the furnace from one place to another. Mr. Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained that they always moved the furnace at</seg><seg type="columnLine">night; it was difficult to do this during the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">because the sun's rays created an etheric storm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The yellow man's conversation entertained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white men notwithstanding their uncertain fate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pablo Pasca, however, trembled on the verge of col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapse.

There's a Zeppelin!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pethwick looked up suddenly. The prisoners had</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded a turn in the valley. Not more than three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards distant rose an enormous structure</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the shape of a Zeppelin. It required a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance to observe this fact, as the huge creation</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood on its end instead of lying horizontal as do</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ordinary flying-ships.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead of being made of cloth, this Zeppelin had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a skin of white metal, no doubt aluminum. Indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the first time a dirigible had been constructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had the staunchness and air-worthiness that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">deserved the name ship. This was no mere bubble</seg><seg type="columnLine">of varnished cloth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was enormous. It rose some seven hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred and fifty feet high, an amazing skyscraper of</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver whose fulgor was enhanced by the dark and</seg><seg type="columnLine">melancholy background of the Infernal Valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The immense vessel rested on its stern which</seg><seg type="columnLine">tapered down to perhaps four feet in diameter. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shored up with long metal rods anchored in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth. The rods, some hundred feet long, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">inserted in the airship just where its great barrel</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to taper to its stern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Five hundred feet up the side of the cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pethwick noticed the controlling planes, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked exceedingly small for the vast bulk they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">designed to pilot. When the engineer pointed these</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to the professor, M. Demetriovich seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you realize, Pethwick, what their small size</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicates? The speed of this ship through the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be prodigious if these tiny controls grip the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air with sufficient leverage to direct this monster."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the old scientist went on to commend the</seg><seg type="columnLine">novel idea of landing the dirigible on her stern.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It did away with wide maneuvering to gain alti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude. This aluminum dirigible could drop into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole slightly larger than her own diameter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">launch herself out of it straight at the sky. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an admirable stroke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Workmen dotted the vessel's side, scrubbing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright skin as assiduously as a crew painting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man-of-war. Pethwick could distinguish this</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrubbing force up for two or three hundred feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beyond that he caught only glimmers of moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">dots amid the reflections of the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The organization of the crew seemed cast along</seg><seg type="columnLine">military lines. Small squads of men or soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">marched in exact ranks and files over the valley to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gather up the animals stunned by the focusing-rods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first Pethwick had not observed these animals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a more careful look showed him a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">specimens that had been struck down as they passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship. The big-headed yellow men were collect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing these in cages, evidently for exhibition purposes</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they returned to the extraordinary land from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they came. The slaughter had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasteful. Only one member of each species had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been taken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The yellow men worked at top speed and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly under the continual barked orders of sol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diery, but oddly enough not a sound was heard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The whole control was mental. The silence gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pethwick the strange impression that he was look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at a gigantic cinema.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A MOVEMENT behind the white men caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to look around. A file of yellow soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">was moving toward the dirigible, coming from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of their burned camp up the valley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These men bore the mounted skeletons which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">DeLong Geographical Expedition had observed</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they first entered the strange valley of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rio Infiernillo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The removal of these objects suggested to Peth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wick that the men from One and their super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirigible would soon sail from the valley. A great</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity to see the departure seized the engineer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1108</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked for the big driving propellers which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought must draw the ship, but he could see none.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that moment four soldiers with a large metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">cage approached the DeLong Geographical party.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the same time on one of the upper rounds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the airship, some seventy-five feet above the base,</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared a yellow man with a peculiar scintillating</seg><seg type="columnLine">star fixed to his big yellow head.

The sun was setting and its rays filled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great charnel valley with a bloody light. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirigible looked like an enormous red water-stand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a few minutes the lower half of the great ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was purple in shadow, while the upper half turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deeper red. The silence was absolute.

A luminous gas seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">boil out in whirls of furious brightness. It spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">everywhere, and in its radiance the great ship stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in brilliant silver from stem to stern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In that fulgor Pethwick saw the restraining rods</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast off, and the dirigible from the land of One</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted straight into the green heart of the eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moment it struck full sunlight at a height</seg><seg type="columnLine">of five hundred yards it seemed caught in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendously strong wind, for it moved eastward</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a velocity that increased by prodigious bounds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Within half a minute its light was reduced from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrific glare of a furnace to the glow of a head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, and then to a radiance like that of a shooting</seg><seg type="columnLine">star against the darkening eastern sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the watchers followed it with their eyes a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange thing happened.

It settled on the cliffs and crags and glowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with spectral luminosity.

Second, a man who habitually com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">municates with his fellows by telepathy would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be accustomed to falsehood, since falsehood is</seg><seg type="columnLine">physically impossible when a man's mind lies be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore his companions like an open book. Third, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man habitually accustomed to truth, lying is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult and uncongenial labor. In brief, lying is</seg><seg type="columnLine">like any other art; it requires practise to do it well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In regard to the serial number, both of the above</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned writers apparently fail to see the enor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous problem it possesses. As for the chlorophyl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laceous blood, our authors pass it with a vague sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mise that somehow it is used in extracting gold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the whole object of the expedition, according</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Mr. Three, was not gold but radium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Because my esteemed colleagues neglected these</seg><seg type="columnLine">two critical points, their whole theories, as ably</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ingeniously defended as they are, to my mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">collapse into mere brilliant sophisms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the brief analysis herewith presented I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch on a number of points, among which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions evoked by the serial number and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chlorophyll blood will be noticed in their proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">places.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First, then, Mr. Three himself states that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">object of the expedition was the extraction of ra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dium from the pitchblende in the Infernal Valley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The use the men from One made of this radium was</seg><seg type="columnLine">demonstrated at the departure of the dirigible, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">that vessel must have been propelled by the ema-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nations of radium. According to the description</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mr. Standifer, the ship used no screw propellers</seg><seg type="columnLine">or tractors, but a powerful emanation of radium</seg><seg type="columnLine">from under its stern shot the great metal cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward exactly as powder propels a skyrocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That radium would possess such power is well</seg><seg type="columnLine">known. It has been calculated that two pounds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">radium would possess sufficient force to swing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth out of its orbit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With such power the airship would be capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of enormous speed. A high speed was guessed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">M. Demetriovich when he observed the small con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trolling plane. However, the vastness of this speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">was demonstrated by Mr. Standifer in the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">paragraph of his account, by his curious observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that the airship, as seen against the evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky, turned violet, indigo blue, green, yellow, orange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">red and then was lost. In other words, it ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the whole spectrum from the most rapid</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the lowest vibrations per second and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What is the meaning of this significant detail?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Allow me to recall an analogy in sound. The tone</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a bell on a train departing at high speed becomes</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower in pitch. This is because the vibrations reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ear at longer intervals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Apply that to the change of light observed 011</seg><seg type="columnLine">the airship. Then the vessel must have been with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing at such a speed that it lowered the "pitch"</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light vibrations from white to red and finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">cancelled its light in blackness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The only conclusion to be drawn from this is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that at the time of the light's extinction, the mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious metal cylinder was hurtling through space</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the speed of light itself; that is to say, at a speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one hundred and eighty-six thousand miles per</seg><seg type="columnLine">second.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OBSERVE that I say, "space," not air. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first place such a speed in air would fuse any</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal. But there is another and a better reason.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It requires the average human eye one-twentieth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a second to perceive a color change. ' If Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Standifer had observed these color changes at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">highest possible nerve rate, the operation would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have acquired seven-twentieths of a second. Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">1110</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">us assume it required half a second. During that</seg><seg type="columnLine">interval the cylinder would have traversed, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of light, ninety-three thousand miles in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight line. That is more than eleven times the</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter of this globe. Therefore it is far outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our atmosphere. Also it proves the mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel was not bound for Austria or Russia. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was leaving the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How was this velocity attained?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I submit by the reaction of radium upon sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As every schoolboy knows, the drift of a comet's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail is caused by the pressure of light. As soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">this airship arose to the height of about five hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">di'ed yards into sunlight, it began to drift east-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward with a rapidly increasing velocity. In other</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, the metal skin of the ship, which Mr. Peth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wick took for aluminum, was probably a much</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighter metal--a metal so light that it was capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of being buffeted along in the surf of sunlight. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the ship were propelled merely on the barbs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunbeams, it would have attained the velocity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. But the velocity of radium emanations is</seg><seg type="columnLine">one-fifteenth that of light. So by running down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light current, and allowing the radium to react</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the sunbeams, a speed of one and one-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteenth the velocity of light may be generated;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is one-hundred and ninety-eight thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles per second.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such speed would admit of interplanetary travel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, it is probable the men from One could</seg><seg type="columnLine">accelerate the radiation from radium by electrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">or chemical means. They may have learned to boil</seg><seg type="columnLine">the metal as men boil water. In such case the pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure of its radiation would be vastly increased,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with it the possible speed of the ship. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">gives an unknown and problematical power of</seg><seg type="columnLine">transition far beyond the velocity of light. At such</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate a journey even to one of the fixed stars would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be within the realm of possibility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We may therefore with prudence hypothesize that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mysterious ether ship observed in the Valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Rio Infiernillo was an interstellar voyager</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopping by the earth as a coaling port to refuel</seg><seg type="columnLine">with radium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, as it is improbable that the ether ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going beyond the confines of our solar system,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a speculation as to what planet the men from One</seg><seg type="columnLine">were bound may be reached by noting the day and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hour the ship sailed from the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As our earth swings around the ecliptic, it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be possible for interplanetary mariners to obtain</seg><seg type="columnLine">a favorable current of sunlight in any direction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No doubt the navigator of the ether ship was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound for one of the planets in opposition to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun at the time of the ship's departure. That is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say the yellow men were sailing for either Neptune</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Jupiter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That the men were returning to some planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">much larger than the earth is suggested by their</seg><seg type="columnLine">small size and extraordinary agility. No doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">these men found the gravitation of the earth slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">compared with the attraction to which they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed. This fact gave them extraordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">vigor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now let us consider the serial number that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">formed Mr. Three's name. It was 1753-12,657,109-</seg><seg type="columnLine">654-3.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This gives rise to a most interesting speculation:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The probable number of the units contained in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">series, when any serial number is given, is com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">puted by multiplying together the component parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the serial number.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For instance, if one has two series of twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">each, the whole number of objects would be twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">four. If one had six major series of two subseries</seg><seg type="columnLine">of twelve each, the total number of units would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">144.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Applying this idea to Mr. Three's serial number,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one would find the total probable population of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jupiter, or the land of One, by multiplying the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponent parts of this number together. This reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enormous number product of 14,510,894,489,356.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That is to say, fourteen and a half quadrillions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This utterly quashes the Incan hypothesis. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not room in South America for fourteen and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half quadrillion people--there is not room on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe for such a number. That, in fact, is the prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able population of either Neptune or Jupiter. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">sake of simplicity, we will assume it is Jupiter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No wonder, then, with such an inconceivable</seg><seg type="columnLine">population, the inhabitants of Jupiter are militar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized. No wonder they suggested Bolshevism to M.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Demetriovich.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With such masses of life, all other species of</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals are probably extinct. This would explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">why the Jovians were so eager to capture specimens</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fauna as well as radium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last point in the record, the chlorophyllaceous</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood, has been to me the most difficult to find any</seg><seg type="columnLine">analogy for in our terrestrial experience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, we must needs grasp the problem firm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly and proceed with considered but ample steps to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward any conclusion to which it leads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chlorophyll is the coloring matter in plants. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">possesses the power of utilizing energy directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">from sunlight. There is no reason to doubt that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the veins of the Jovians it still retains that pe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culiar power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With such an extraordinary fluid in his veins, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be possible for a Jovian to stand in the sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shine and to obtain from it energy and strength,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as a human being obtains energy and strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">by eating vegetables that have stood in the sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In fact, the first method is no more amazing than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second. If, indeed, there be a difference, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtedly our human method is the more fantastic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The idea of obtaining energy from sunshine, not by</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing in it, as any one would suppose, but by</seg><seg type="columnLine">eating something else that has stood in it, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">grotesque to the verge of madness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Let us pursue that thought. No doubt in a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">course of fourteen and a half quadrillion inhabitants</seg><seg type="columnLine">space would be so dear that there would be no va-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cant or tillable land. Therefore on Jupiter every</seg><seg type="columnLine">man must absorb whatever sunshine he received.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There would be no such thing as eating.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This accounts for the amazement of Mr. Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">at seeing Standifer eat his lunch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To put the same idea in another form--the crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ether ship were flora, not fauna.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This accounts for the yellow pear-like texture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREEN SPLOTCHES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1111</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">their skins. No doubt the young Jovians are green</seg><seg type="columnLine">in color. It would also explain why Mr. Three was</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely without anger when attacked and without</seg><seg type="columnLine">pity for Pablo's pleadings, or for Standifer when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was burned, or for Ruano when he was mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anger, pity, love and hatred are the emotional</seg><seg type="columnLine">traits of the mammalia. They have been developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through epochs of maternal protection. It is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed in plants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Three was a plant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would also explain why Mr. Three took only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal of each species, instead of a male and a fe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">male. Sex is perhaps unknown on Jupiter. Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three was perhaps expecting his animals to bud</seg><seg type="columnLine">or sprout.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE last question to be broached is, How is it</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible for plant life to possess mobility?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I wish to recall to the inquirer that here on our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own globe the spores of the algae and other plants</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that order have the power of swimming freely in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea. Still, they are plants--plants just as mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bile as fishes. They become stationary only at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">later stage of their development.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, if for some reason these algae spores</seg><seg type="columnLine">could retain their mobility, the result would be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking, swimming or crawling plant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The line between animal and plant life has never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been so clearly drawn. It seems mere fortuity that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first forebear of animal life swam about and</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught its sustenance by enveloping it in its gela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinous droplet, rather than by adhering to a reef</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drawing its energy directly from the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If that far-off protozoa had clung to the reef, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reader of this paragraph might have been a syca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">more or a tamarind--he would not have been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now Mr. Three's forefather evidently crawled out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sea into the sunshine but found nothing to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">envelop; therefore he followed the lip of the Jovian</seg><seg type="columnLine">tide up and down, drawing his energy from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun's rays.

Flashing suddenly out of the darkenss there came a flying multitude of particles of rock, glittering like dust-specks in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunbeam .... and then I saw a bright spot of light, that shone a little to one side of my path, growing very rapidly larger,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and perceived that it was the planet Saturn rushing toward me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">UNDER THE KNIFE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HAT if I die under it?" The thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">recurred again and again, as I walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">home from Haddon's. It was a purely</seg><seg type="columnLine">personal question. I was spared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep anxieties of a married man, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew there were few of my intimate friends but</seg><seg type="columnLine">would find my death troublesome chiefly on ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">count of their duty of regret. I was surprised in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed, and perhaps a little humiliated, as I turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter over, to think how few could possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">exceed the conventional requirement. Things came</seg><seg type="columnLine">before me stripped of glamour, in a clear dry light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">during that walk from Haddon's house over Prim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose Hill. There were the friends of my youth;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I perceived now that our affection was a tradition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we foregathered rather laboriously to main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain. There were the rivals and helpers of my later</seg><seg type="columnLine">career: I suppose I had been cold-blooded and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">demonstrative--one perhaps implies the other. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be that even the capacity for friendship is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">question of physique. There had been a time in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own life when I had grieved bitterly enough at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loss of a friend; but as I walked home that</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon the emotional side of my imagination</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dormant. I could not pity myself, nor feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorry for my friends, nor conceive of them as griev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was interested in this deadness of my emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional nature--no doubt a concomitant of my stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nating physiology; and my thoughts wandered off</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the line it suggested. Once before, in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot youth, I had suffered a sudden loss of blood, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been within an ace of death. I remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">now that my affections as well as my passions had</seg><seg type="columnLine">drained out of me, leaving scarce anything but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tranquil resignation, a dreg of self-pity. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been weeks before the old ambitions and tender-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nesses and all the complex moral interplay of a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reasserted themselves. It occurred to me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the real meaning of this numbness might be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradual slipping away from the pleasure-pain guid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance of the animal man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It has been proven, I take</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, as thoroughly as any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing can be proven in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this world, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher emotions, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moral feelings, even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subtle unselfishness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">love, are evolved from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elemental desires and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fears of the simple ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal : they are the harness</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which man's mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">freedom goes. And it</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be that as death overshadows us, as our pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibility of acting diminishes, this complex growth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of balanced impulse, propensity and aversion, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">interplay inspires our acts, goes with it. Leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">what?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was suddenly brought back to reality by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">imminent collision with the butcher-boy's tray. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that I was crossing the bridge over the Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gent's Park Canal, which runs parallel with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Zoological Gardens. The boy in blue had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been looking over his shoulder at a black barge ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vancing slowly, towed by a gaunt white horse. In</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Gardens a nurse was leading three happy little</seg><seg type="columnLine">children over the bridge. The trees were bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">green; the spring hopefulness was still unstained</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the dusts of summer; the sky in the water was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright and clear, but broken by long waves, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">quivering bands of black, as the barge drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">through. The breeze was stirring; but it did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">stir me as the spring breeze used to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was this dullness of feeling in itself an anticipa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion? It was curious that I could reason and fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low out a network of suggestion as clearly as ever;</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, at least, it seemed to me. It was calmness</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than dullness that was coming upon me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was there any ground for the belief in the presenti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of death? Did a man near to death begin</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinctively to withdraw himself from the meshes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of matter and sense, even before the cold hand was</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid upon his? I felt strangely isolated--isolated</seg><seg type="columnLine">without regret--from the life and existence about</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. The children playing in the sun and gathering</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength and experience for the business of life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the park-keeper gossiping with a nursemaid, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nursing mother, the young couple intent upon each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other as they passed me, the trees by the wayside</seg><seg type="columnLine">spreading new pleading leaves to the sunlight, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stir in their branches--I had been part of it all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I had nearly done with it now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some way down the Broad Walk I perceived that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was tired, and that my feet were heavy. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot that afternoon, and I turned aside and sat down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on one of the green chairs that line the way. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute I had dozed into a dream, and the tide of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my thoughts washed up a vision of the resurrec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. I was still sitting in the chair, but I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself actually dead, withered, tattered, dried, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye (I saw) pecked out by birds. "Awake!" cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">a voice; and incontinently the dust of the path and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mould under the grass became insurgent. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never before thought of Regent's Park as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cemetery, but now, through the trees, stretching</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far as eye could see, I beheld a flat plain of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">writhing graves and heel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing tombstones. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be some trou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble; the rising dead ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to stifle as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled upward, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled in their struggles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red flesh was torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones. "Awake!" cried a</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice; but I determined I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not rise to such</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrors. "Awake!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">They would not let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. "Wike up!" said an angry voice. A cockney</seg><seg type="columnLine">angel! The man who sells the tickets was shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, demanding my penny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I paid my penny, pocketed my ticket, yawned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched my legs, and, feeling now rather less</seg><seg type="columnLine">torpid, got up and walked on towards Langham</seg><seg type="columnLine">Place. I speedily lost myself again in a shifting</seg><seg type="columnLine">maze of thoughts about death. Going across</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marylebone Road into that crescent at the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Langham Place, I had the narrowest escape from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shaft of a cab, and went on my way with a pal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitating heart and a bruised shoulder. It struck</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rVHE master of scientifiction has written a remark-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">able tale, and although the title may scare you o at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">first, the story is not of the horror type at all.

I knew more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more certainly that I should die under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation; at times I think I was inclined to pose</seg><seg type="columnLine">to myself. The doctors were coming at eleven, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not get up. It seemed scarce worth while to</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble about washing and dressing, and though</seg><seg type="columnLine">I read my newspapers and the letters that came by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first post, I did not find them very interesting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a friendly note from Addison, my old</seg><seg type="columnLine">sehool-friend, calling my attention to two discrep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancies and a printer's error in my new book, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one from Langridge venting some vexation over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Minton. The rest were business communications.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I breakfasted in bed. The glow of pain at my side</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed more massive. I knew it was pain, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet, if you can understand, I did not find it very</seg><seg type="columnLine">painful. I had been awake and hot and thirsty in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night, but in the morning bed felt comfortable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the night-time I had lain thinking of things that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were past; in the morning I dozed over the ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of immortality. Haddon came, punctual to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute with a neat black bag; and Mowbray soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed. Their arrival stirred me up a little. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to take a more personal interest in,the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceedings. Haddon moved the little octagonal table</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the bedside, and, with his broad back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, began taking things out of his bag. I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light click of steel upon steel. My imagination,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found, was not altogether stagnant. "Will you</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt me much?" I said in an off-hand tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a bit," Haddon answered over his shoulder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We shall chloroform you. Your heart's as sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a bell." And as he spoke, I had a whiff of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pungent sweetness of the anaesthetic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stretched me out, with a convenient ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posure of my side, and, almost before I realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was happening, the chloroform was being ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ministered. It stings the nostrils, and there is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffocating sensation at first. I knew I should die</seg><seg type="columnLine">--that this was the end of consciousness for me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And suddenly I felt that I was not prepared for</seg><seg type="columnLine">death: I had a vague sense of duty overlooked--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew not what. What was it I had not done? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could think of nothing more to do, nothing desir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able left in life; and yet I had the strangest dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclination to death. And the physical sensation</seg><seg type="columnLine">was painfully oppressive. Of course the doctors</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not know they were going to kill me. Possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">I struggled. Then I fell motionless, and a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence, a monstrous silence, and an impenetrable</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness came upon me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There must have been an interval of absolute</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconsciousness, seconds or minutes. Then with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chilly, unemotional clearness, I perceived that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet dead. I was still in my body; but all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">multitudinous sensations that come sweeping from</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to make up the background of consciousness had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, leaving me free of it all. No, not free of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">all; for as yet something still held me to the poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">stark flesh upon the bed--held me, yet not so</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely that I did not feel myself external to it, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dependent of it, straining away from it. I do not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">think I saw, I do not think I heard; but I per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived all that was going on, and it was as if I both</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard and saw. Haddon was bending over me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mowbray behind me; the scalpel--it was a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">scalpel--was cutting my flesh at the side under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying ribs. It was interesting to see myself cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">like cheese, without a pang, without even a qualm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The .interest was much of a quality with that one</seg><seg type="columnLine">might feel in a game of chess between strangers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haddon's face was firm and his hand steady; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was surprised to perceive (how I know not) that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was feeling the gravest doubt as to his own wis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom in the conduct of the operation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mowbray's thoughts, too, I could see. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking that Haddon's manner showed too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the specialist. New suggestions came up like</seg><seg type="columnLine">bubbles through a stream of frothing meditation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and burst one after another in the little bright spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his consciousness. He could not help noticing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and admiring Haddon's swift dexterity, in spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his envious quality and his disposition to detract.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw my liver exposed. I was puzzled at my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition. I did not feel that I was dead, but I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">different in some way from my living self. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray depression, that had weighed on me for a year</seg><seg type="columnLine">or more and colored all my thoughts, was gone. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceived and thought without any emotional tint</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all. I wondered if every one perceived things</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this way under chloroform, and forgot it again</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he came out of it. It would be inconvenient</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look into some heads, and not forget.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although I did not think that I was dead, I still</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceived quite clearly that I was soon to die. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought me back to the consideration of Haddon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceedings. I looked into his mind, and saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was afraid of cutting a branch of the portal</seg><seg type="columnLine">vein. My attention was distracted from details by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the curious changes going on in his mind. His con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness was like the quivering little spot of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is thrown by the mirror of a galvanometer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His thoughts ran under it like a stream, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the focus bright and distinct, some shad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">owy in the half-light of the edge. Just now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little glow was steady; but the least movement on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mowbray's part, the slightest sound from outside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even a faint difference in the slow movement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the living flesh he was cutting, set the light-spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">shivering and spinning. A new sense-impression</seg><seg type="columnLine">came rushing up through the flow of thoughts; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lo! the light-spot jerked away towards it, swifter</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a frightened fish. It was wonderful to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that upon that unstable, fitful thing depended all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the complex emotions of the man; that for the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">five minutes, therefore, my life hung upon its</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements. And he was growing more and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous in his work. It was as if a little picture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cut vein grew brighter, and struggled to oust from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brain another picture of a cut falling short of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mark. He was afraid: his dread of cutting</seg><seg type="columnLine">too little was battling with his dread of cutting</seg><seg type="columnLine">too far.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN, suddenly, like an escape of water from</seg><seg type="columnLine">under a lock-gate, a great uprush of horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">realization set all his thoughts swirling, and simul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taneously I perceived that the vein was cut. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">started back with a hoarse exclamation, and I saw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">J</seg><seg type="columnLine">UNDER THE KNIFE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1115</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the brown-purple blood gather in a swift bead, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">run trickling. He was horrified. He pitched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-stained scalpel on to the octagonal table; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly both doctors flung themselves upon me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making hasty and ill-conceived efforts to remedy</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disaster. "Ice!" said Mowbray, gasping. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew that I was killed, though my body still clung</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I will not describe their belated endeavors to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save me, though I perceived every detail. My per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptions were sharper and swifter than they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever been in life; my thoughts rushed through my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind with incredible swiftness, but with perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">definition. I can only compare their crowded clar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity to the effects of a reasonable dose of opium.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a moment it would all be over, and I should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">free. I knew I was immortal, what would happen</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not know. Should I drift off presently, like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">puff of smoke from a gun, in some kind of half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">material body, an attenuated version of my ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terial self? Should I find myself suddenly among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the innumerable hosts of the dead, and know the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world about me for the phantasmagoria it had al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways seemed? Should I drift to some spiritualistic</seg><seg type="columnLine">seance, and there make foolish, incomprehensible</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempts to affect a purblind medium? It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">state of unemotional curiosity, of colorless expecta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. And then I realized a growing stress upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, a feeling as though some huge human magnet</seg><seg type="columnLine">was drawing me upward out of my body. The stress</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew and grew. I seemed an atom for which mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strous forces were fighting. For one brief, terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment sensation came back to me. That feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of falling headlong which comes in nightmares,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that feeling a thousand times intensified, that and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a black horror swept across my thoughts in a tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent. Then the two doctors, the naked body with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its cut side, the little room, swept away from under</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and vanished, as a speck of foam vanishes down</seg><seg type="columnLine">an eddy.	*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was in mid-air. Far below was the West End</seg><seg type="columnLine">of London, receding rapidly--for I seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying swiftly upward--and as it receded, passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">westward like a panorama. I could see, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faint haze of smoke, the innumerable roofs</seg><seg type="columnLine">chimney-set, the narrow roadways, stippled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">people and conveyances, the little specks of squares,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the church steeples like thorns sticking out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fabric. But it spun away as the earth rotated</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its axis, and in a few seconds (as it seemed)</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was over the scattered clumps of town about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ealing, the little Thames a thread of blue to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">south, and the Chiltern Hills and the North Downs</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming up like the rim of a basin, far away and</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint with haze. Up I rushed. And at first I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the faintest conception what this headlong rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward could mean.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every moment the circle of scenery beneath me</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew wider and wider, and the details of town and</seg><seg type="columnLine">field, of hill and valley, got more and more hazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pale and indistinct, a luminous gray was min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled more and more with the blue of the hills and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the green of the open meadows; and a little patch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cloud, low and far to the west, shone ever more</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazzlingly white. Above, as the veil of atmosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">between myself and outer space grew thinner, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky, which had been a fair springtime blue at first,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">grew deeper and richer in color, passing steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the intervening shades, until presently it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as dark as the blue sky of midnight, and pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently as black as the blackness of a frosty starlight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at last as black as no blackness I had ever be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">held. And first one star, and then many, and at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">an innumerable host broke out upon the sky; more</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars than any one has ever seen from the face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth. For the blueness of the sky is the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sun and stars sifted and spread abroad blind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly: there is diffused light even in the darkest</seg><seg type="columnLine">skies of winter, and we do not see the stars by</seg><seg type="columnLine">day only because of the dazzling irradiation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun. But now I saw things--I know not how; as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suredly with no mortal eyes--and that defect of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bedazzlement blinded me no longer. The sun was</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredibly strange and wonderful. The body of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a disc of blinding white light: not yellowish,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it seems to those who live upon the earth, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">livid white, all streaked with scarlet streaks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rimmed about with a fringe of writhing tongues</seg><seg type="columnLine">of red fire. And shooting half-way across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens from either side of it and brighter than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Milky Way, were two pinions of silver white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making it look more like those winged globes I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have seen in Egyptian sculpture than anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">else I can remember upon earth. These I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the solar corona, though I had never seen any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of it but a picture during the days of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthly life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When my attention came back to the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, I saw that it had fallen very far away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Field and town were long since indistinguish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, and all the varied hues of the country were</seg><seg type="columnLine">merging into a uniform bright gray, broken only</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the brilliant white of the clouds that lay scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered in flocculent masses over Ireland and the west</seg><seg type="columnLine">of England. For now I could see the outlines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the north of France and Ireland, and all this Island</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Britain, save where Scotland passed over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon to the north, or where the coast was blurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">or obliterated by cloud. The sea was a dull gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">and darker than the land; and the whole panorama</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rotating slowly towards the east.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL this had happened so swiftly that until I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was some thousand miles or so from the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had no thought for myself. But now I perceived</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had neither hands nor feet, neither parts nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">organs, and that I felt neither alarm nor pain. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">about me I perceived that the vacancy (for I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">already left the air behind) was cold beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination of man; but it troubled me not. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun's rays shot through the void, powerless to light</seg><seg type="columnLine">or heat until they should strike on matter in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">course. I saw things with a serene self-forgetful-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, even as if I were God. And down below there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing away from me--countless miles in a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">--where a little dark spot on the gray marked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">position of London, two doctors were struggling to</seg><seg type="columnLine">restore life to the poor hacked and outworn shell</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had abandoned. I felt then such release, such</seg><seg type="columnLine">serenity as I can compare to no mortal delight I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have ever known.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was only after I had perceived all these things</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the meaning of that headlong rush of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth grew into comprehension. Yet it was so sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">1116</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pie, so obvious, that I was amazed at my never</seg><seg type="columnLine">anticipating the thing that was happening to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had suddenly been cut adrift from matter: all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was material of me was there upon earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling away through space, held to the earth by</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravitation, partaking of the earth-inertia, moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its wreath of epicycles round the sun, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun and the planets on their vast march</seg><seg type="columnLine">through space. But the immaterial has no inertia,</seg><seg type="columnLine">feels nothing of the pull of matter for matter:</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it parts from its garments of flesh, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">it remains (so far as space concerns it any longer)</seg><seg type="columnLine">immovable in space. I was not leaving the earth:</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth was leaving me, and not only the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the whole solar system was streaming past.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And about me in space, invisible to me, scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the wake of the earth upon its journey, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be an innumerable multitude of souls, stripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">like myself of the material, stripped like myself of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passions of the individual and the generous</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotions of the gregarious brute, naked intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gences, things of new-born wonder and thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelling at the strange release that had sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly come on them!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I receded faster and faster from the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">white sun in the black heavens, and from the broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shining earth upon which my being had begun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I seemed to grow in some incredible manner vast:</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast as regards this world I had left, vast as re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gards the moments and periods of human life. Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon I saw the full circle of the earth, slightly gib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bous, like the moon when she nears her full, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">very large; and the silvery shape of America was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now in the noonday blaze wherein (as it seemed)</seg><seg type="columnLine">little England had been basking but a few minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago. At first the earth was large; and shone in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavens, filling a great part of them; but every</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment she grew smaller and more distant. As she</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrank, the broad moon in its third quarter crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">into view over the rim of her disc. I looked for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the constellations. Only that part of Aries directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the sun and the Lion, which the earth cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered, were hidden. I recognized the tortuous, tat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered band of the Milky Way with Vega very bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">between sun and earth; and Sirius and Orion shone</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendid against the unfathomable blackness in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite quarter of the heavens. The Pole Star was</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead, and the Great Bear hung over the circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the earth. And away beneath and beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining corona of the sun were strange groupings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stars I had never seen in my life--notably a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dagger-shaped group that I knew for the Southern</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cross. All these were no larger than when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shone on earth, but the little stars that one</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarce sees shone now against the setting of black</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacancy as brightly as the first-magnitudes had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done, while the larger worlds were points of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">describable glory and color. Aldebaran was a spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blood-red fire, and Sirius condensed to one point</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light of innumerable sapphires. And they shone</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily: they did not scintillate, they were calmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">glorious. My impressions had an adamantine hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and brightness: there was no blurring softness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no atmosphere, nothing but infinite darkness set</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the myriads of these acute and brilliant points</seg><seg type="columnLine">and specks of light. Presently when I looked again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little earth seemed no bigger than the sun, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it dwindled and turned as I looked, until in a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond's space (as it seemed to me), it was halved;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so it went on swiftly dwindling. Far away in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opposite direction, a little pinkish pin's head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light, shining steadily, was the planet Mars. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">swam motionless in vacancy, and, without a trace</seg><seg type="columnLine">of terror or astonishment, watched the speck of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cosmic dust we call the world fall away from me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently it dawned upon me that my sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">duration had changed; that my mind was moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">not faster but infinitely slower, that between each</seg><seg type="columnLine">separate impression there was a period of many</seg><seg type="columnLine">days. The moon spun once round the earth as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted this; and I perceived clearly the motion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars in his orbit. Moreover, it appeared as if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time between thought and thought grew steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater, until at last a thousand years was but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment in my perception.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT first the constellations had shone motionless</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the black background of infinite space;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but presently it seemed as though the group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars about Hercules and the Scorpion was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracting, while Orion and Aldebaran and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighbors were scattering apart. Flashing sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly out of the darkness there came a flying multi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude of particles of rock, glittering like dust-specks</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a sunbeam, and encompassed in a faintly lumi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nous cloud. They swirled about me, and vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">again in a twinkling far behind. And then I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a bright spot of light, that shone a little to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side of my path, was growing very rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger, and perceived that it was the planet Saturn</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing towards me. Larger and larger it grew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swallowing up the heavens behind it, and hiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">every moment a fresh multitude of stars. I per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived its flattened, whirling body, its disc-like belt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seven of its little satellites. It grew and grew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">till it towered enormous, and then I plunged amid</seg><seg type="columnLine">a streaming multitude of clashing stones and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing dust-particles and gas-eddies, and saw for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment the mighty triple belt like three concen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tric arches of moonlight above me, its shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">black on the boiling tumult below. These things</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened in one-tenth of the time it takes to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. The planet went by like a flash of lightning;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a few seconds it blotted out the sun, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then became a mere black, dwindling, winged</seg><seg type="columnLine">patch against the light. The earth, the mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">mote of my being, I could no longer see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a stately swiftness, in the profoundest</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence the solar system fell from me as if it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a garment, until the sun was a mere star amid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">multitude of stars, with its eddy of planet-specks</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost in the confused glittering of the remoter light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was no longer a denizen of the solar system: I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to the outer Universe, I seemed to grasp</seg><seg type="columnLine">and comprehend the whole world of matter. Ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">more swifty the stars closed in about the spot where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Antares and Vega had vanished in a phosphor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">escent haze, until that part of the sky had the sem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blance of a whirling mass of nebulae, and ever be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore me yawned vaster gaps of vacant blackness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the stars shone fewer and fewer. It seemed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I moved towards a point between Orion's belt</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sword; and the void about that region opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaster and vaster every second, an incredible gulf</seg><seg type="columnLine">UNDER THE KNIFE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1117</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of nothingness into which I was falling. Faster and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever faster the universe rushed by, a hurry of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling motes at last, speeding silently into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">void. Stars glowing brighter and brighter, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their circling planets catching the light in a ghostly</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion as I neared them, shone out and vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">again into inexistence; faint comets, clusters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteorites, winking specks of matter, eddying</seg><seg type="columnLine">light-points, whizzed past, some perhaps a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions of miles or so from me at most, few nearer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling with unimaginable rapidity, shooting con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stellations, momentary darts of fire, through that</seg><seg type="columnLine">black, enormous night. More than anything else</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was like a dusty draught, sunbeam-lit. Broader</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wider and deeper grew the starless space, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacant Beyond, into which I was being drawn. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">last a quarter of the heavens was black and blank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the whole headlong rush of stellar universe</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed in behind me like a veil of light that is gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered together. It drove away from me like a mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strous jack-o'-lantern driven by the wind. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come out into the wilderness of space. Ever the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacant blackness grew broader, until the hosts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stars seemed only like a swarm of fiery specks</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurrying away from me, inconceivably remote, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness, the nothingness and emptiness, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">about me on every side. Soon the little universe of</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter, the cage of points in which I had begun to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, was dwindling, now to a whirling disc of lu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minous glittering, and now to one minute disc of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hazy light. In a little while it would shrink to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">point, and at last would vanish altogether.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly feeling came back to me--feeling in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shape of overwhelming terror; such a dread of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those dark vastitudes as no words can describe, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">passionate resurgence of sympathy and social de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sire. Were there other souls, invisible to me as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them, about me in the blackness? or was I in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed, even as I felt, alone? Had I passed out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">being into something that was neither being nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">not-being? The covering of the body, the covering</seg><seg type="columnLine">of matter, had been torn from me, and the hallu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cinations of companionship and security. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was black and silent. I had ceased to be. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing. There was nothing, save only that</seg><seg type="columnLine">infinitesimal dot of light that dwindled in the gulf.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I strained myself to hear and see, and for a while</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was naught but infinite silence, intolerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness, horror, and despair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I saw that about the spot of light into</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the whole world of matter had shrunk there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a faint glow. And in a band on either side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it the darkness was not absolute. I watched it</seg><seg type="columnLine">for ages, as it seemed to me, and through the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting the haze grew imperceptibly more distinct.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then about the band appeared an irregular</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud of the faintest, palest brown. I felt a pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sionate impatience; but the things grew brighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">so slowly that they scarce seemed to change. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unfolding itself? What was this strange red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dish dawn in the interminable night of space?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE cloud's shape was grotesque. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be looped along its lower side into four</seg><seg type="columnLine">projecting masses, and, above, it ended in a straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">line. What phantom was it? I felt assured I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen that figure before; but I could not think what,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor where, nor when it was. Then the realization</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed upon me. It was a clenched Hand. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone in space, alone with this huge, shadowy Hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon which the whole Universe of Matter lay like</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unconsidered speck of dust. It seemed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I watched it through vast periods of time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the forefinger glittered a ring; and the uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse from which I had come was but a spot of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the ring's curvature. And the thing that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand gripped had the likeness of a black rod.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through a long eternity I watched this Hand, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ring and the rod, marveling and fearing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting helplessly on what might follow. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though nothing could follow: that I should watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever, seeing only the Hand and the thing it held,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and understanding nothing of its import. Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole universe but a refracting speck upon some</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater Being? Were our worlds but the atoms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">another universe, and those again of another, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so on through an endless progression? And what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was I? Was I indeed immaterial? A vague per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suasion of a body gathering about me came into</seg><seg type="columnLine">my suspense. The abysmal darkness about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hand filled with impalpable suggestions, with un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain, fluctuating shapes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, suddenly, came a sound, like the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tolling bell: faint, as if infinitely far; muffled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though heard through thick swathings of dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness: a deep, vibrating resonance, with vast gulfs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of silence between each stroke. And the Hand ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to tighten on the rod. And I saw far above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Hand, towards the apex of the darkness, a circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dim phosphorescence, a ghostly sphere whence</seg><seg type="columnLine">these sounds came throbbing; and at the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroke the Hand vanished, for the hour had come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I heard a noise of many waters. But the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">rod remained as a great band across the sky. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then a voice, which seemed to run to the uttermost</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts of space, spoke, saying, "There will be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more pain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that an almost intolerable gladness and radi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance rushed in upon me, and I saw the circle shin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing white and bright, and the rod shining and</seg><seg type="columnLine">black and many things else distinct and clear. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the circle was the face of the clock, and the rod the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rail of my bed. Haddon was standing at the foot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the rail, with a small pair of scissors on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers; and the hands of my clock on the mantel</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his shoulder were clasped together over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour of twelve. Mowbray was washing something</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a basin at the octagonal table, and at my side I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a subdued feeling that could scarce be spoken</seg><seg type="columnLine">of as pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The operation had not killed me. And I perceived,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly, that the dull melancholy of half a year</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lifted from my mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The End.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The HAMMERING MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">At the bottom of each screen was a circular hole just large enough for a man's arm to go through; and at Trant's command the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men put their arms through them. ... "I was certain that there was but one man who could recognize or feel any emotion at</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of that yellow and time-worn paper. ... I showed it to Meyan, and obtained this really amazing reaction.**</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">.1118</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE HAMMERING MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TRANT, on the rainy morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">13th, sat alone in his office. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">t, as he bent closely over a heap</seg><seg type="columnLine">vritten pages spread before him</seg><seg type="columnLine">lesk, a small instrument in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinual motion ticked like a watch. It was for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour of idleness; he was reading fiction. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his passion for making visible and recording</seg><seg type="columnLine">the workings of the mind, he was taking a perman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent record of his feelings as he read.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The instrument strapped on Trant's arm was</seg><seg type="columnLine">called a sphygmograph. It carried a small steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">rod which pressed tightly on his wrist artery. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">rod, rising and falling with each rush of the blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave through the artery, transmitted its motion</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a system of small levers. These levers operated</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stylus point, which touched the surface of a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volving drum. And as Trant had adjusted around</seg><seg type="columnLine">this drum a strip of smoked paper, the stylus point</seg><seg type="columnLine">traced on its sooty surface a continuous wavy line</seg><seg type="columnLine">which rose and fell with each beat of the psycho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">logist's pulse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the interest of the story gripped Trant, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">wavy line grew flatter, with elevations farther apart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the interest flagged, his pulse returned to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal beat and the line became regular in its un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dulations. At an exciting incident, the elevations</seg><seg type="columnLine">swelled to greater height. And the psychologist</seg><seg type="columnLine">was noting with satisfaction how the continual</seg><seg type="columnLine">variations of the line gave definite record of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story's sustained power, when he was interrupted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the sharp ring of his telephone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An excited, choleric voice came over the wire:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mr. Trant? . .

Are you certain it was not this</seg><seg type="columnLine">second interview with your father," he turned again</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the boy, "that made Miss Silber refuse you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No; it was not. When I got back yesterday and</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned from father what had happened, I went out</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once to Eva at her home.

But an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluence--the influence of this man--had come be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween us! She told me there was no longer any</seg><seg type="columnLine">question of her marrying! She refused the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planation she had promised to make to me! She</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me to go away and forget her, or--as I wrote</seg><seg type="columnLine">you--to think of her as dead!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can imagine my feelings!

As I was wander-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about the house, I saw the evening paper lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread out on the library table and my eye caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">her name in it. It was this advertisement that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent you, Mr. Trant! Late as it was, I called up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the newspaper offices and learned the facts regard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing its insertion. At daybreak I motored out to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eva. The house was empty! I went round it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mud and rain, peering in at the windows. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the housekeeper was no longer there, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighbors could tell me nothing of the time or man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner of their leaving. Nor has any word come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to the office."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is all, then," the psychologist said, thought-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully. "'The 17th of the 10th, 1905,'" he reread</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beginning of the advertisement. "That is, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, a date, the 17th of the 10th month, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is put there to recall to Miss Silber some event of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it would be sure to remind her. I suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know of no private significance this date might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have for her, or you would have mentioned it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"None on the 17th; no, Mr. Trant," young Ed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards replied. "If it were only the 30th I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">help you; for I know that on that date Eva cele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brates some sort of anniversary at home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In Search of the "Hammering Man"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TRANT opened a bulky almanac lying on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk, and as he glanced swiftly down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">page his eyes flashed suddenly with comprehension.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are correct, I think, as to the influence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the so-called 'hammering man' on her movements,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the psychologist said. "But as to her connection</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the man and her reasons, that is another mat-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ter. But of that I cannot say till I have had half an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour to myself at the Crerar Library."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The library, Mr. Trant?" cried young Edwards,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes; and, as speed is certainly essential, I hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">you still have your motor below."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As young Edwards nodded, the psychologist</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized his hat and gloves and his instrument case,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and preceded the others from the office. Half an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour later he descended from the library to rejoin</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Edwardses waiting in the motor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The man who inserted that advertisement--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'hammering man,' I believe, of whom we are in</seg><seg type="columnLine">search," he announced briefly, "is named N.

The case has suddenly developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">far darker and more villainous aspects even than</seg><seg type="columnLine">I feared. Please order the chauffeur to go there</seg><seg type="columnLine">as rapidly as possible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Coy Court, at which, twenty minutes later, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">bade young Edwards stop the motor, proved to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of those short intersecting streets that start</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the crowded thoroughfare of Halsted Street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">run squalidly a block or two east or west, and stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">short against the sooty wall of a foundry or ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine shop. Number 7, the third house on the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">--like many of its neighbors, whose windows bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greek, Jewish, or Lithuanian signs--was given up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the basement to a store, but the upper floors</seg><seg type="columnLine">were plainly devoted to lodgings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door was opened by a slattern little girl of</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Does N.

Then, as the child nodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the first inquiry and shook her head at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second, "When will he be back?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He comes to-night again, sure. Perhaps sooner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But to-night, or to-morrow, he goes away for good.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He have paid only till to-morrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was right, you see, in saying we had need for</seg><seg type="columnLine">haste," Trant said to young Edwards. "But there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is one thing we can try, even though he is not here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let me have the picture you showed me this morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took from the boy's hand the picture of Eva</seg><seg type="columnLine">Silber, opened the leather case, and held it so the</seg><seg type="columnLine">child could see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know that lady?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes!" The child showed sudden interest. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is Mr. Meyan's wife."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "His wife!" cried young Edwards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So," the psychologist said swiftly to the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, "you have seen this lady here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She comes last night." The child had grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly loquacious. "Because she is coming, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meyan makes trouble that we should get a room</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for her. Already she has sent her things.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And we get ready the room next to his. But be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause she wants still another room, she goes away</seg><seg type="columnLine">last night again. Rooms come not so easy here;</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have many people. But now we have another, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-night she is coming again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Does it now seem necessary for us to press this</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigation further?" Cuthbert Edwards said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">caustically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he spoke, the sound of measured, heavy blows</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to them down the dark stair apparently from</seg><seg type="columnLine">mz</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the second floor of the building. The elder Ed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards cried, excitedly and triumphantly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is that? Listen! That man--Meyan, if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is Meyan--must be here! For that is the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammering!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is even better luck than we could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected!" exclaimed the psychologist; and he slip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped by the child and sped swiftly up the stairs, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his companions closely following. At the head of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flight he passed by a stunted woman--whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked resemblance to the little girl below estab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lished at once her two relationships as mother and</seg><seg type="columnLine">landlady--and a trembling old man, and with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elder Edwards tore open door after door of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms upon that floor and the floor above before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman could prevent him. The rooms were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Meyan must have escaped!" said Cuthbert Ed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards, as they returned, crestfallen, to the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">story. "But we have proof at least that the child</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke the truth in saying Miss Silber had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">here to see him, for she hardly would have allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her father to come here without her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Her father! So this is Miss Silber's father!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trant swiftly turned to examine with the keenest</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest the old man who shrank back, shivering and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuddering, toward a corner. Even in that dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened hall he conveyed to the psychologist an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression of hoary whiteness. His hair and beard</seg><seg type="columnLine">were snowy white; the dead pallor of his skin was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unhealthy whiteness of potato shoots that have</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprouted in a cellar, and the iris of his eyes had</seg><seg type="columnLine">faded until it was almost indistinguishable. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">there remained something in the man's appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">which told Trant that he was not really old--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he still should be moving, daring, self-confident, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader among men, instead of cringing and shrink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing thus at. the slightest move of these chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">visitors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Meyan? Is it because you are looking for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meyan that you have made all this disturbance?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woman broke in. "Then why didn't you ask?</seg><seg type="columnLine">For now he is at the saloon, I think, only across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then we will go there at once; but I will ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">you," he turned to the elder Edwards, "to wait for</seg><seg type="columnLine">us at the motor, for two of us will be enough for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose and more than two may defeat it by</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarming Meyan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Trant descended the stairs, took his instrument</seg><seg type="columnLine">case from the motor, and with young Edwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed the street quickly to the saloon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Story Told by the Pulse Record of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Russian</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A DOZEN idlers leaned against the bar or sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">in chairs tilted against the wall. Trant ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amined these idlers one after another closely. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">only man at whom he did not seem to look was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">who, as the only red-headed man in the place, must</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly be Meyan. "Red-headed" was the only de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scription they had of him, but meager as it was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the landlady's statement as to Meyan being</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the saloon, Trant resolved to test him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The psychologist took an envelope from his pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wrote rapidly upon the back of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am going to try something," he whispered,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as he flicked the envelope across the table to Ed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards. "It may not succeed, but if I am able to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meyan into a test, then go into that back room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak aloud what I have written on the envelope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though you had just come in with somebody."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, as Edwards nodded his comprehension, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">psychologist turned easily to the man nearest him</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the bar--a pallid Lithuanian sweatshop worker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose you can stand a lot of that?" Trant</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded to his glass of pungent whisky. "Still--it</seg><seg type="columnLine">has its effect on you. Sends your heart action up--</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickens your pulse."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you?" the man grinned; "temperance</seg><seg type="columnLine">lecturer?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Something like that," the psychologist answered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"At least, I can show you the effect whisky has up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on your heart."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He picked up the instrument case and opened it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The loungers gathered about him and Trant saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">with satisfaction that they thought him an itinerant</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperance advocate. They stared curiously at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument he had taken from its case.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It goes on the arm," he explained. The Lithuan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ian, with a grin toward his companions, began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn up his sleeve. "Not you," Trant said; "you</seg><seg type="columnLine">just had a drink."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is there a drink in this? I ain't had a drink</seg><seg type="columnLine">since breakfast!" said another who pushed up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table and bared his blue-veined forearm for Trant</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fasten the instrument to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Young Winton Edwards, watching as curiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the others, saw Trant fasten the sphygmograph</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the mechanic's arm, and the stylus point com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mence to trace on the sooty surface a wavy line, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal record of the mechanic's pulse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see it!" Trant pointed out to the others the</seg><seg type="columnLine">record, as it unwound slowly from the drum. "Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought you have, every feeling, every sensation--</seg><seg type="columnLine">taste, touch, smell--changes the beating of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart and shows upon this little record. I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">show through that whether you had a secret you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were trying to conceal, as readily as I will show the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect whisky has on you, or as I can learn whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">this man likes the smell of onion." He took from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the free-Iunch on the bar a slice of onion, which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">held under the man's nose. "Ah! you don't like</seg><seg type="columnLine">onion! But the whisky will make you forget its</seg><seg type="columnLine">smell, I suspect."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the odor of the whisky reached the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nostrils, the record line--which when he smelled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">onion had become suddenly flattened with elevations</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer together, as the pulse beat weakly but more</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly--began to return to the shape it had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first. He tossed off the liquor, rolling it upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue, and all saw the record regain its first ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance; then, as the stimulant began to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect, the pencil point lifted higher at each rise</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the elevations became farther apart. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared and laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whisky effects you about normally, I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">say," Trant began to unfasten the sphygmograph</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the man's wrist. "I have heard it said that</seg><seg type="columnLine">black-haired men, like you, feel its effect least of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all; light-haired men more; men with red hair like</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine feel the greatest effect, it's said. We red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired men have to be careful with whisky."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hey! there's a red-headed man," one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE HAMMERING MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1123</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd cried, suddenly, pointing. "Try it on him."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two enthusiasts at once broke from the group</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rushed eagerly to Meyan. He had continued,</seg><seg type="columnLine">inattentive through all, to read his newspaper; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">now he laid it down. Trant and young Edwards, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he rose and slouched half curiously toward them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see plainly for the first time his strongly</seg><seg type="columnLine">boned, coarsely powerful face, and heavy-lidded</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, and the grossly muscular strength of his big-</seg><seg type="columnLine">framed body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pah! your watered whisky!" he jeered in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely thick and heavy voice, when the test had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been explained to him. "I am used to stronger</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinks!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He grinned derisively in the surrounding faces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked a chair up to the table and sat down. Trant</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced toward Edwards, and Edwards moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently back from the group and disappeared un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed through the partition door. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">psychologist swiftly adjusted the sphygmograph up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the out-stretched arm and watched intently an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant until the stylus point had caught up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong and even pulse which set it rising and fall-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in perfect rhythm. As he turned to the bar for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whisky, the rear door slammed and the voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trant was expecting spoke:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes; it was at Warsaw the police took him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was taken without warning and from his friend's</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. What next? The prisons are full, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep on filling them; the graveyards will be full</seg><seg type="columnLine">next!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Following Up the Clew of the Sphygmograph</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Â«T OOK! look!" cried the Lithuanian beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">-L' Trant at the table. "He bragged about watered</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisky, but just the sight of it makes his heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat bigger and stronger!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Trant bent eagerly over the smoked paper, watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the stronger, slower pulse beat which the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord showed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes; before he takes the whisky his pulse is</seg><seg type="columnLine">strengthened," Trant answered; "for that is how</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pulse acts when a man is pleased and exults!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He waited now, almost inattentively, while Meyan</seg><seg type="columnLine">drank the whisky and the others grew silent in de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feat as the giant's pulse, true to his boast, showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost no variation under the fiery liquor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pah, such child-foolishness!" Meyan, with steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, set the glass back on the table. Then, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trant unclasped the straps around his arm, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose, yawned in their faces, and lounged out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The psychologist turned to meet young Edwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he hurried in, and together they went out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">join the father at the motor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can do nothing sooner than to-night," Trant</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, shortly, an expression of keen anxiety on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. "I must learn more about this man, but my</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquiries must be conducted alone. If you will meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">me here again at seven o'clock to-night, say at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pawn-broker's shop we passed upon the corner, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope to be able to solve the mystery of the 'ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mering man,' and the influence he is undoubtedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">exerting on Miss Silber. I may say," he added after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment, "that I would not attach too much weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the child's statement that Miss Silber is Meyan's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wife. It is understood, then, that you will meet me</seg><seg type="columnLine">here to-night as I have suggested."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded to his clients, and ran to catch a pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing trolley car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Promptly at seven o'clock in accordance with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trant's directions, young Winton Edwards and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">father entered the pawnshop and started negotia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions for a loan. Almost immediately after they ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rived there, Trant joined them, still carrying in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand his instrument case. The boy and his father</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed their negotiations and went out with Trant</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the street. They saw then, to their surprise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the psychologist was not alone. Two men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaiting them, each of whom carried a case like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trant's. The elder of the two, a man between fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sixty years old, met young Edwards' stare with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a benignant glance of his pale blue eyes through an</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense pair of gold spectacles. The other was</seg><seg type="columnLine">young, pale, broad-browed, with an intelligent face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his gaze was fixed in a look of dreamy contem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plation. They were dressed as mechanics, but their</seg><seg type="columnLine">general appearance was not that of workmen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door of Meyan's lodging house was opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them by the landlady. She led the way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second floor, but paused to show a room to Trant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is Meyan's room," Trant explained. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">will wait for him over here." He followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman into a small and stuffy bed-room on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the hall. "We had better not speak while</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are waiting and--we had better wait in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the strange, stuffy, darkened little room the</seg><seg type="columnLine">five sat in silence. Footsteps passed often in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street outside, and twice some one went through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall. A half hour they waited thus. Then a heavier</seg><seg type="columnLine">footstep warned them of Meyan coming. A mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment later, the front door opened again and ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted--as Trant felt from the effect of the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone which reached the boy waiting at his side--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eva Silber. Trant quickly prevented him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">going out. It was only after several minutes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned on the light and motioned to the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangers who had come with him. They immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately rose and left the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am going to submit you both to a very trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordeal," Trant said to his clients, in a tone so low</seg><seg type="columnLine">it could not reach the hallway, "and it will require</seg><seg type="columnLine">great self-control on your part.

I went on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now I saw that what I had thought to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the low range at the base of the peaks was a thicker</seg><seg type="columnLine">litter of ruins. The Hand Mountain was really much</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther off. The road itself passed through these</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruins and between two high rocks that raised them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves like a gateway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crawling man paused. His hands began that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickening pad--pad again. Little drops of bloody</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat showed on his forehead. But after a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two he grew quiet. He smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They were a gateway," he said. "I reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. I went between them. I sprawled flat, clutch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the earth in awe and terror. For I was on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad stone platform. Before me was--sheer space!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Imagine the Grand Canyon three times as wide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">roughly circular and with the bottom dropped out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That would be something like what I was looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">into.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was like peeping over the edge of a cleft</seg><seg type="columnLine">world down into the infinity where the planets roll!</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the far side stood the five peaks. They looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a gigantic warning hand stretched up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. The lips of the abyss curved away on each</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I could see down perhaps a thousand feet. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thick blue haze shut out the eye. It was like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue you see gather on the high hills at dusk. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pit--it was awesome! Awesome as the Maori's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gulf of Ranalak, that sinks between the living and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dead and that only the freshly released soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">has strength to leap across--but never strength to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leap back again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I crept back from the verge and stood up, weak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking. My hand rested against one of the rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gateway. There was carving upon it. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sharp outlines was the heroic figure of a man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His back was turned. His arms were stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">above his head and between them he carried some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that looked like a sun disk with radiating</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines of light. There were symbols on the disk</seg><seg type="columnLine">that reminded me of Chinese. But they were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese. No! They had been made by hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust ages before the Chinese stirred in the womb</seg><seg type="columnLine">of time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I looked at the opposite rock. It bore an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">actly similar figure. There was an odd peaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">head-dress on both. The rocks themselves were tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">angular and the carvings were on the side closest</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pit. The gesture of the men seemed to be that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of holding something back--of barring. I looked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> closer. Behind the outstretched hands and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disks I seemed to see a host of vague shapes and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly a multitude of globes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I traced them out vaguely. Suddenly I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">unaccountably sick. There had come to me an</seg><seg type="columnLine">impression--I can't call it sight--an impression of</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous upright slugs. Their swollen bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to dissolve, then swim into sight, then dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solve again--all except the globes which were their</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads and that remained clear. They were;--un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterably loathsome. Overcome by an inexplicable</seg><seg type="columnLine">and overpowering nausea I stretched myself upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slab. And then--I saw the stairway that led</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into the pit!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A stairway!" we cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A stairway," repeated the crawling man as</seg><seg type="columnLine">patiently as before. "It seemed not so much carved</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the rock as built into it. Each slab was</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps twenty feet long and five feet wide. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran down from the platform and vanished into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue haze."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A stairway," said Anderson incredulously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"built into the wall of a precipice and leading down</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a bottomless pit--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not bottomless," interrupted the crawling man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There was a bottom. Yes. I reached it," he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on dully. "Down the stairway--down the stair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He seemed to grip his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he went on firmly. "I went down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairway. But not that day. I made my camp back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gates. At dawn I filled my knapsack with</seg><seg type="columnLine">food, my two canteens with water from a spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">that wells up there by the gateway, walked be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the carved monoliths and stepped over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The steps run along the side of the pit at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty degree pitch. As I went down and down I</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied them. They were of a greenish rock quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">different from the granitic porphyry that formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall of the pit. At first I thought that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">builders had taken advantage of an outcropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">stratum, and had carved the gigantic flight from it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the regularity of the angle at which it fell made</seg><seg type="columnLine">me doubtful of this theory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After I had gone down perhaps half a mile I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped out upon a landing. From this landing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs made a V-shaped turn and again ran on</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward, clinging to the cliff at the same angle</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the first flight. After I had made three of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">turns I knew that the steps dropped straight down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wherever they went in a succession of angles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No strata could be so regular as that. No, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairway was built by hands! But whose? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">why? The answer is in those ruins around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the pit--never I think to be read.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By noon I had lost sight of the lip of the abyss.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Above me, below me, was nothing but the blue haze.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beside me, too, was nothingness, for the further</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast of rock had long since vanished in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">haze. I felt no dizziness, and no fear; only a vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity. What was I to discover? Some ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wonderful civilization that had ruled when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poles were tropical gardens? A new world? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">key to the mystery of man himself ? Nothing liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, I felt sure--all was too old for life. Still, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">1134</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">work so wonderful must lead to something quite as</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful I knew. What was it? I went on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At regular intervals I had passed the mouths of</seg><seg type="columnLine">small caves. There would be three thousand steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then an opening, three thousand steps more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">an opening--and so on and on. Late that afternoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">I stopped before one of these clefts. I suppose I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone then three miles down the pit, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">the angles were such that I had walked in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully ten miles. I examined the entrance. On each</seg><seg type="columnLine">side was carved the same figures as on the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">portals at the lip of the pit. But now they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing face forward, the arms outstretched with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their disks, as though holding something back from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shaft itself. Now, too, their faces were</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered with veils and there were no hideous shapes</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I went inside the cave. It ran back for twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards like a burrow. It was dry and perfectly light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could see, outside, the blue haze rising upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a column. I felt an extraordinary sense of se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curity, although I had not been conscious of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear. I felt that the figures at the entrance were</seg><seg type="columnLine">guardians--but against what? I felt so secure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">even curiosity on this point was dulled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The blue haze thickened and grew faintly</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminescent. I fancied that it was dusk above. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate and drank a little and slept. When I awoke the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue had lightened again, and I fancied it was dawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">above. I went on. I forgot the gulf yawning at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. I felt no fatigue and little hunger or thirst,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although I had drunk and eaten sparingly. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">night I spent within another of the caves. And at</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn I descended again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was late that day when I first saw the city--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was silent for a time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The city," he said at last, "the city of the pit!</seg><seg type="columnLine">But not such a city as you have ever seen--nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other man who has lived to tell of it. The pit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think, must be shaped like a bottle; the opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the five peaks is the neck. But how wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom is I do not know--thousands of miles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe. And what may lie behind the city--I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I had begun to catch little glints of light far</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in the blue. Then I saw the tops of--trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I suppose they are. But not our kind of trees--</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpleasant, reptilian trees. They reared themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">on high, thin trunks and their tops were nests of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick tendrils with ugly little leaves like narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads--or snake heads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The trees were red, a vivid, angry red. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there I began to glimpse spots of shining yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low. I knew these were water because I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">things breaking through their surface--or at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could see the splash and ripple but what it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that disturbed them I never saw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Straight beneath me was the city. Mile after</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile of closely packed cylinders that lay upon their</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides in pyramids of three, of five--of dozens--</seg><seg type="columnLine">piled upon each other. It is so hard to make you</seg><seg type="columnLine">see what that city is like--look, suppose you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">water pipes of a certain length and first you lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">three of them side by side and on top of them you</seg><seg type="columnLine">place two and on these two one; or suppose you</seg><seg type="columnLine">take five for a foundation and place on these four</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and then three, then two and then one. Do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">see? That was the way they looked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And they were topped by towers, by minarets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by flares, by fans and twisted monstrosities. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleamed as though coated with pale rose flame.

It curved out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down straight through the top of the highest pile</seg><seg type="columnLine">of carven cylinders and then--it vanished through</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. It was appalling--it was demoniac--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crawling man stopped. His eyes rolled up</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his head. He trembled and again his arms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs began their horrible crawling movement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From his lips came a whispering. It was an echo</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the high murmuring we had heard the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came to us. I put my hands over his eyes. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">quieted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The things accursed!" he said. "The People of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pit!

I went down through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of that--building. Blue darkness shrouded me</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment and I felt the steps twist into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiral. I wound down and then I was standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">high up in--I can't tell you what. I'll have to call</seg><seg type="columnLine">it a room. We have no images for what is in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit. A hundred feet below me was the floor. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls sloped down and out from where I stood in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">series of widening crescents. The place was colos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sal--and it was filled with a curious mottled red</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. It was like the light inside a green</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gold-flecked fire opal. The spiral stairs wound</seg><seg type="columnLine">below me. I went down to the last step. Far in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of me rose a high columned altar. Its pillars</seg><seg type="columnLine">were carved in monstrous scrolls--like mad octo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">puses with a thousand drunken tentacles; they</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested on the backs of shapeless monstrosities</seg><seg type="columnLine">carved in crimson stone.

Only a subtle sense in the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the brain grasped them vaguely. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">formless things that gave no conscious image, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed into the mind like small hot seals--ideas of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate--of combat between unthinkable monstrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">things--victories in a nebulous hell of steaming,</seg><seg type="columnLine">obscene jungles--aspirations and ideals immeasur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably loathsome--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And as I stood I grew aware of something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay behind the lip of the altar fifty feet above me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew it was there--I felt it with every hair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">every tiny bit of my skin.

A dozen times that day was my life</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatened by fearsome creatures of the earth or</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky, though I could not but note that the farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">north I traveled, the fewer were the great dino-</seg><seg type="columnLine">saurs, though they still persisted in lesser numbers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the other hand, the quantity of ruminants and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the variety and frequency of carnivorous animals</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased. Each square mile of Caspak harbored its</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At intervals along the way I found bits of mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin, and often they reassured me when otherwise I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have been doubtful of the trail to take where</seg><seg type="columnLine">two crossed or where there were forks, as occurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">at several points. And so, as night was drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, I came to the southern end of a line of cliffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">loftier than any I had seen before, and as I ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached them, there was wafted to my nostrils</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pungent aroma of wood-smoke. What could it</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean? There could, to my mind, be but a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">solution: man abided close by, a higher order of</seg><seg type="columnLine">man than we had as yet seen, other than Ahm, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neanderthal man. I wondered again as I had so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many times that day if it had not been Ahm who</seg><seg type="columnLine">stole Lys.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cautiously I approached the flank of the cliffs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they terminated in an abrupt escarpment as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though some all powerful hand had broken off a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great section of rock and set it upon the surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth. It was now quite dark, and as I crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the edge of the cliff, I saw at a little dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance a great fire around which were many figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">--apparently human figures. Cautioning Nobs to</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence, and he had learned many lessons in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">value of obedience since we had entered Caspak, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">slunk forward, taking advantage of whatever cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could find, until from behind a bush I could dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinctly see the creatures assembled by the fire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were human and yet not human. I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">say that they were a little higher in the scale of</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolution than Ahm, possibly occupying a plane of</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolution between that of the Neanderthal man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what is known as the Grimaldi race. Their fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures were distinctly negroid, though their skins</seg><seg type="columnLine">were white. A considerable portion of both torso</seg><seg type="columnLine">and limbs was covered with short hair, and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical proportions were in many respects apelike,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though not so much so as were Ahm's. They car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried themselves in a more erect position, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">their arms were considerably longer than those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Neanderthal man. As I watched them, I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they possessed a language, that they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of fire and that they carried besides the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooden club of Ahm a thing which resembled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crude stone hatchet. Evidently they were very low</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the scale of humanity, but they were a step up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward from those I had previously seen in Caspak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lys Is Found--An Attack and a Deadly Shot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT what interested me most was the slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure of a dainty girl, clad only in a thin bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of muslin which scarce covered her knees--a bit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of muslin torn and ragged about the lower hem.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was Lys, and she was alive and so far as I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, unharmed. A huge brute with thick lips and</seg><seg type="columnLine">prognathous jaw stood at her shoulder. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking loudly and gesticulating wildly. I was close</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to hear his words, which were similar to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the language of Ahm, though much fuller, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were many words I could not understand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, I caught the gist of what he was saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">--which in effect was that he had found and cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured this Galu, that she was his and that he defied</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone to question his right of possession. It ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to me, as I afterward learned was the fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was witnessing the most primitive of mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riage ceremonies. The assembled members of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribe looked on and listened in a sort of dull and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfunctory apathy, for the speaker was by far</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mightiest of the clan. There seemed no one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispute his claims when he said, or rather shouted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in stentorian tones: "I am Tsa. This is my she.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who wishes her more than Tsa?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do," I said in the language of Ahm, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped out into the firelight before them. Lys</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a little cry of joy and started toward me, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tsa grasped her arm and dragged her back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are you?" shrieked Tsa. "I kill! I kill!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I kill!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The she is mine," I replied, "and I have come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim her. I kill if you do not let her come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me." And I raised my pistol to a level with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. Of course, the creature had no conception</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the purpose of the strange little implement</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I was poking toward him. With a sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was half human and half the growl of a wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast, he sprang toward me. I aimed at his heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fired, and as he sprawled headlong to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, the others of his tribe, overcome by fright</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the report of the pistol, scattered toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs--while Lys, with outstretched arms, ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I crushed her to me, there rose from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black night behind us and then to our right and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our left a series of frightful screams and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieks, bellowings, roars and growls. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night-life of this jungle world coming into its own</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the huge, carnivorous nocturnal beasts which</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the nights of Caspak hideous. A shuddering</seg><seg type="columnLine">sob ran through Lys' figure. "O God," she cried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"give me the strength to endure, for his sake!" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that she was upon the verge of a breakdown,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all that she must have passed through of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear and horror that day, and I tried to quiet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reassure her as best I might; but even to me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future looked most unpromising, for what chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life had we against the frightful hunters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night who even now were prowling closer to us?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now I turned to see what had become of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribe, and in the fitful glare of the fire I perceived</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the face of the cliff was pitted with large holes</seg><seg type="columnLine">into which the man-things were clambering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come," I said to Lys, "we must follow them. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot last a half-hour out here. We must find a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave." Already we could see the blazing green eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hungry carnivora. I seized a brand from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire and hurled it out into the night, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back an answering chorus of savage and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rageful protest; but the eyes vanished for a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Selecting a burning branch for each of us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1141</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">we advanced toward the cliffs, where we were met</seg><seg type="columnLine">by angry threats.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They will kill us," said Lys. "We may as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep on in search of another refuge."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They will not kill us so surely as will those</seg><seg type="columnLine">others out there," I replied. "I am going to seek</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter in one of these caves; nor will the man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">things prevent." And I kept on in the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cliff's base. A huge creature stood upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge and brandished his stone hatchet. "Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I will kill you and take the she," he boasted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You saw how Tsa fared when he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept my she," I replied in his own tongue. "Thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">will you fare and all your fellows if you do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">permit us to come in peace among you out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangers of the night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go north," he screamed. "Go north among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galus, and we will not harm you. Some day will</seg><seg type="columnLine">we be Galus; but now we are not. You do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">belong among us. Go away or we will kill you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The she may remain if she is afraid, and we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep her; but the he must depart."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The he won't depart," I replied, and approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">still nearer. Rough and narrow ledges formed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature gave access to the upper caves. A man</seg><seg type="columnLine">might scale them if unhampered and unhindered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but to clamber upward in the face of a belligerent</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribe of half-men and with a gii'l to assist was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond my capability.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not fear you," screamed the creature. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">were close to Tsa; but I am far above you. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot harm me as you harmed Tsa. Go away!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Cave Dwellers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I PLACED a foot upon the lowest ledge and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clambered upward, reaching down and pulling</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lys to my side. Already I felt safer. Soon we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be out of danger of the beasts again closing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in upon us. The man above us raised his stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatchet above his head and leaped lightly down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet us. His position above me gave him a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage, or at least so he probably thought, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came with every show of confidence. I hated</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do it, but there seemed no other way, and so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot him down as I had shot down Tsa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see," I cried to his fellows, "that I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill you wherever you may be. A long way off I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can kill you as well as I can kill you near by. Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">us come among you in peace. I will not harm you</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you do not harm us. We will take a cave high</seg><seg type="columnLine">up.' Speak!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, then," said one. "If you will not harm</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, you may come. Take Tsa's hole, which lies</seg><seg type="columnLine">above you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The creature showed us the mouth of a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave, but he kept at a distance while he did it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Lys followed me as I crawled in to explore. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had matches with me, and in the light of one I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found a small cavern with a flat roof and floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">which followed the cleavage of the strata. Pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the roof had fallen at some long-distant date,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as was evidenced by the depth of the filth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubble in which they were embedded. Even a</seg><seg type="columnLine">superficial examination revealed the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing had ever been attempted that might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">improved the habitability of the cave; nor, should</seg><seg type="columnLine">I judge, had it ever been cleaned out. With con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderable difficulty I loosened some of the larger</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces of broken rock which littered the floor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed them as a barrier before the doorway. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too dark to do more than this. I then gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lys a piece of dried meat, and sitting inside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance, we dined as must have some of our an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient forbears at the dawning of the age of man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while from below the open diapason of the savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">night rose weird and horrifying to our ears. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light of the great fire still burning we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see huge, skulking forms, and in the blacker back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground countless flaming eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lys shuddered, and I put my arm around her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drew her to me; and thus we sat throughout</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hot night. She told me of her abduction and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fright she had undergone, and together we</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanked God that she had come through unharmed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because the great brute had not dared to pause</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the danger-infested way. She said that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had but just reached the cliffs when I arrived, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">on several occasions her captor had been forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take to the trees with her to escape the clutches</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some hungry cave-lion or saber-tooth tiger, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that twice they had been obliged to remain for</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable periods before the beasts had retired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nobs, by dint of much scrambling and one or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two narrow escapes from death, had managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow us up the cliff and was now curled between</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and the doorway, having devoured a piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dried meat, which he seemed to relish im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mensely. He was the first to fall asleep; but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine we must have followed suit soon, for we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were both tired. I had laid aside my ammunition-</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt and rifle, though both were close beside me;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but my pistol I kept in my lap beneath my hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, we were not disturbed during the night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when I awoke, the sun was shining on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree-tops in the distance. Lys' head had drooped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my breast, and my arm was still about her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shortly afterward Lys awoke, and for a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could not seem to comprehend her situation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She looked at me and then turned and glanced at</seg><seg type="columnLine">my arm about her, and then she seemed quite sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly to realize the scantiness of her apparel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew away, covering her face with her palms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blushing furiously. I drew her back toward me</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kissed her, and then she threw her arms about</seg><seg type="columnLine">tny neck and wept softly in mute surrender to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inevitable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Bathers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was an hour later before the tribe began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stir about. We watched them from our</seg><seg type="columnLine">"apartment," as Lys called it. Neither men nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">women wore any sort of clothing or ornaments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they all seemed to be abdut of an age; nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">were there any babies or children among them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was, to us, the strangest and most inexplic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able of facts, but it recalled to us that though we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen many of the lesser developed wild people</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Caspak, we had never yet seen a child or an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man or old woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a while they became less suspicious of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then quite friendly in their brutish way. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked at the fabric of our clothing, which seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to interest them, and examined my rifle and pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the ammunition in the belt around my waist.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I showed them the thermos-bottle, and when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured a little water from it, they were delighted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">1142</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking that it was a spring which I carried about</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me--a never-failing source of water supply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One thing we both noticed among their other</seg><seg type="columnLine">characteristics: they never laughed or smiled;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then we remembered that Ahm had never done</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, either. I asked them if they knew Ahm; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they said they did not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">One of them said: "Back there we may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">known him." And he jerked his head to the south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You came from back there?" I asked. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at me in surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We all come from there," he said. "After a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while we go there." And this time he jerked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head toward the north. "Be Galus," he concluded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many times now had we heard this reference to</seg><seg type="columnLine">becoming Galus. Ahm had spoken of it many</seg><seg type="columnLine">times. Lys and I decided that it was a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">original religious conviction, as much a part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as their instinct for self-preservation--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">primal acceptance of a hereafter and a holier state.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a brilliant theory, but it was all wrong. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know it now, and how far we were from guessing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wonderful, the miraculous, the gigantic truth</seg><seg type="columnLine">which even yet I may only guess at--the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sets Caspak apart from all the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world far more definitely than her isolated geo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graphic position or her impregnable barrier of</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant cliffs. If I could live to return to civilization,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I should have meat for the clergy and the layman</seg><seg type="columnLine">to chew upon for years--and for the evolutionists,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After breakfast the men set out to hunt, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the women went to a large pool of warm water</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered with a green scum and filled with billions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tadpoles. They waded in to where the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about a foot deep and lay down in the mud.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They remained there from one to two hours and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then returned to the cliff. While we were with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, we saw this same thing repeated every morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; but though we asked them why they did it we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could get no reply which was intelligible to us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All they vouchsafed by way of explanation was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">single word Ata. They tried to get Lys to go in</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them and could not understand why she re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused. After the first day I went hunting with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men, leaving my pistol and Nobs with Lys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but she never had to use them, for no reptile or</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast ever approached the pool while the women</seg><seg type="columnLine">were there--nor, so far as we know, at other times.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no spoor of wild beast in the soft mud</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the banks, and the water certainly didn't look</seg><seg type="columnLine">fit to drink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This tribe lived largely upon the smaller ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals which they bowled over with their stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatchets after making a wide circle about their</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarry and driving it so that it had to pass close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one of their number. The little horses and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller antelope they secured in sufficient numbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">to support life, and they also ate numerous vari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eties of fruits and vegetables. They never brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">in more than sufficient food for their immediate</seg><seg type="columnLine">needs; but why bother? The food problem of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caspak is not one to cause worry to her inhabitants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Lost in Caspak A Recent Grave</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE fourth day Lys told me that she thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">she felt equal to attempting the return journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the morrow, and so I set out for the hunt in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">high spirits, for I was anxious to return to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fort and learn if Bradley and his party had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and what had been the result of his expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition. I also wanted to relieve their minds as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lys and myself, as I knew that they must already</seg><seg type="columnLine">have given us up for dead. It was a cloudy day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though warm, as it always is in Caspak. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">odd to realize that just a few miles away winter</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay upon the storm-tossed ocean, and that snow</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be falling all about Caprona; but no snow</seg><seg type="columnLine">could ever penetrate the damp, hot atmosphere of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great crater.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had to go quite a bit farther than usual be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore we could surround a little bunch of antelope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as I was helping drive them, I saw a fine red</seg><seg type="columnLine">deer a couple of hundred yards behind me. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been asleep in the long grass, for I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">him rise and look about him in a bewildered way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then I raised my gun and let him have it. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped, and I ran forward to finish him with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long thin knife, which one of the men had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">me; but just as I reached him, he staggered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet and ran on for another two hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">--when I dropped him again. Once more was this</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeated before I was able to reach him and cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">his throat; then I looked around for my com:</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions, as I wanted them to come and carry the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meat home; but I could see nothing of them. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">called a few times and waited, but there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">response and no one came. At last I became dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gusted, and cutting off all the meat that I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">conveniently carry, I set off in the direction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs. I must have gone about a mile before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth dawned upon me--I was lost, hopelessly lost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The entire sky was still completely blotted out</seg><seg type="columnLine">by dense clouds; nor was there any landmark vis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible by which I might have taken my bearings. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on in the direction I thought was south but</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I now imagine must have been about due</seg><seg type="columnLine">north, without detecting a single familiar object.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a dense wood I suddenly stumbled upon a thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">which at first filled me with hope and later with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most utter despair and dejection. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little mound of new-turned earth sprinkled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers long since withered, and at one end was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat slab of standstone stuck in the ground. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grave, and it meant for me that I had at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled into a country inhabited by human be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings. I would find them; they would direct me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliffs; perhaps they would accompany me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">take us back with them to their abodes--to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">abodes of men and women like ourselves. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes and my imagination ran riot in the few yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had to cover to reach that lonely grave and stoop</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I might read the rude characters scratched</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the simple headstone. This is what I read:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HERE LIES JOHN TIPPET</seg><seg type="columnLine">ENGLISHMAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">KILLED BY TYRANNOSAURUS</seg><seg type="columnLine">10 SEP., A.

Tippet lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">here in this gloomy wood! Tippet dead! He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a good man, but the personal loss was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">what affected me. It was the fact that this silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave gave evidence that Bradley had come this</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1143</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">far upon his expedition and that he too probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lost, for it was not our intention that he should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be long gone. If I had stumbled upon the grave</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one of the party, was it not within reason to</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe that the bones of the others lay scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">gomewhere near?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS I stood looking down upon that sad and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lonely mound, wrapped in the most dismal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of reflections and premonitions, I was sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly seized from behind and thrown to earth. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">I fell, a warm body fell on top of me, and hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped my arms and legs. When I could look up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw a number of giant figures pinioning me down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while others stood about surveying me. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">again was a new type of man--a higher type than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the primitive tribe I had just quitted. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a taller people, too, with better-shaped skulls and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more intelligent faces. There were less of the ape</seg><seg type="columnLine">characteristics about their features, and less of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">negroid, too. They carried weapons, stone-shod</seg><seg type="columnLine">spears, stone knives, and hatchets--and they wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">ornaments and breechcloths--the former of feathers</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn in their hair and the latter made of a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">snake-skin cured with the head on, the head de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pending to their knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course I did not take in all these details upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the instant of my capture, for I was busy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">other matters. Three of the warriors were sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon me, trying to hold me down by main strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">and awkwardness, and they were having their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands full in the doing, I can tell you. I don't like</seg><seg type="columnLine">to appear conceited, but I may as well admit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am proud of my strength and the science I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquired and developed in the directing of it--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my horsemanship I always have been proud of.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And now, that day, all the long hours that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">put into careful study, practice and training</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought me in two or three minutes a full return</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon my investment. Californians, as a rule, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar with ju-jutsu, and I especially had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a study of it for several years, both at school and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the gym of the Los Angeles Athletic Club, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">recently I had had, in my employ, a Jap who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wonder at the art.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It took me just about thirty seconds to break</seg><seg type="columnLine">the elbow of one of my assailants, trip another</seg><seg type="columnLine">and send him stumbling backward among his fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows, and throw the third completely over my head</seg><seg type="columnLine">in such a way that when he fell his neck was broken.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the instant that the others of the party stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">in mute and inactive surprise, I unslung my rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">--which, carelessly, I had been carrying across my</seg><seg type="columnLine">back; and when they charged, as I felt they would,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I put a bullet in the forehead of one of them. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped them all temporarily--not the death of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fellow, but the report of the rifle, the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had ever heard. Before they were ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack me again, one of them spoke in a command-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing tone to his fellows, in a language similar to</seg><seg type="columnLine">but still more comprehensive than that of the tribe</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the south, as theirs was more complete than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ahm's. He commanded them to stand back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he advanced and addressed me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He asked me who I was, from whence I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">and what my intentions were. I replied that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stranger in Caspak, that I was lost and that my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">only desire was to find my way back to my com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions. He asked where they were and I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him toward the south somewhere, using the Cas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pakian phrase which, literally translated, means</seg><seg type="columnLine">"toward the beginning." His surprise showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon his face before he voiced it in words. "There</seg><seg type="columnLine">are no Galus there," he said. "You have lied. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galus have turned you out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I tell you," I said angrily, "that I am from an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other country, far from Caspak, far beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">high cliffs. I do not know who the Galus may be;</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have never seen them. This is the farthest north</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have been. Look at me--look at my clothing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my weapons. Have you ever seen a Galu or any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other creature in Caspak who possessed such</seg><seg type="columnLine">things?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had to admit that he had not, and also that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was much interested in me, my rifle and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way I had handled his three warriors. Finally he</seg><seg type="columnLine">became half convinced that I was telling him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth and offered to aid me if I would show him</seg><seg type="columnLine">how I had thrown the man over my head and also</seg><seg type="columnLine">make him a present of the "bang-spear," as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">called it. I refused to give him my rifle, but prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ised to show him the trick he wished to learn if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would guide me in the right direction. He told me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would do so tomorrow, that it was too late</seg><seg type="columnLine">today and that I might come to their village and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spend the night with them. I was loath to lose so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much time; but the fellow was obdurate, and so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompanied them. The two dead men they left</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they had fallen, nor gave them a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance--thus cheap is life upon Caspak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tracing the Evolution of the Races of Man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THESE people also were cave-dwellers, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">their caves showed the result of a higher intel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ligence that brought them a step nearer to civilized</seg><seg type="columnLine">man than the tribe next "toward the beginning."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The interiors of their caverns were cleared of rub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bish, though still far from clean, and they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">pallets of dried grasses covered with the skins of</seg><seg type="columnLine">leopard, lynx, and bear, while before the entrances</seg><seg type="columnLine">were barriers of stone and small, rudely circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone ovens. The walls of the cavern to which I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">conducted were covered with drawings scratched</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the sandstone. There were the outlines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant red deer, of mammoths, of tigers and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts. Here, as in the last tribe, there were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">children or any old people. The men of this tribe</seg><seg type="columnLine">had two names, or rather names of two syllables,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their language contained words of two syl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lables ; whereas in the tribe of Tsa the words were</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of a single syllable, with the exception of a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">few like Atis and Gcdus. The chief's name was</seg><seg type="columnLine">To-jo, and his household consisted of seven females</seg><seg type="columnLine">and himself. These women were much more</seg><seg type="columnLine">comely, or rather less hideous than those of Tsa's</seg><seg type="columnLine">people; one of them, even, was almost pretty, being</seg><seg type="columnLine">less hairy and having a rather nice skin, with high</seg><seg type="columnLine">coloring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were all much interested in me and exam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ined my clothing and equipment carefully, han-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dling and feeling and smelling of each article. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned from them that their people were known</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Band-lu, or spear-men; Tsa's race was called</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sto-lu--hatchet-men. Below these in the scale of</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolution came the Bo-lu, or club-men, and then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">1144</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Alus, who had no weapons and no language. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">that word I recognized what to me seemed the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable discovery I had made upon Caprona,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for unless it were mere coincidence, I had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a word that had been handed down from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning of spoken language upon earth, been</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed down for millions of years, perhaps, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">little change. It was the sole remaining thread</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ancient woof of a dawning culture which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been woven when Caprona was a fiery mount</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a great land-mass teeming with life. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">linked the unfathomable then to the eternal now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And yet it may have been pure coincidence; my</seg><seg type="columnLine">better judgment tells me that it is coincidence that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Caspak the term for speechless man is Alus, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the outer world of our own today it is Alalus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">borrowed from the Greek by Haeckel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The comely woman of whom I spoke was called</seg><seg type="columnLine">So-ta, and she took such a lively interest in me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that To-jo finally objected to her attentions, em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phasizing his displeasure by knocking her down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicking her into a corner of the cavern. I leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them while he was still kicking her, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtaining a quick hold upon him, dragged him</seg><seg type="columnLine">screaming with pain from the cave. There I made</seg><seg type="columnLine">him promise not to hurt the she again, upon pain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of worse punishment. So-ta gave me a grateful</seg><seg type="columnLine">look; but To-jo and the balance of his women were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sullen and ominous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later in the evening So-ta confided to me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was soon to leave the tribe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So-ta soon be Kro-lu," she confided in a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper. I asked her what a Kro-lu might be, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she tried to explain, but I do not yet know if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood her. From her gestures I deduced that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kro-lus were a people who were armed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">bows and arrows, had vessels in which to cook their</seg><seg type="columnLine">food and huts of some sort in which they lived,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were accompanied by animals. It was all very</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragmentary and vague, but the idea seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Kro-lus were a more advanced people than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Band-lus. I pondered a long time upon all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had heard, before sleep came to me. I tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find some connection between these various races</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would explain the universal hope which each</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them harbored that some day they would be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come Galus. So-ta had given me a suggestion; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the resulting idea was so weird that I could scarce</seg><seg type="columnLine">even entertain it; yet it coincided with Ahm's ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed hope, with the various steps in evolution</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had noted in the several tribes I had encoun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered and with the range of type represented in</seg><seg type="columnLine">each tribe. For example, among the Band-lu were</seg><seg type="columnLine">such types as So-ta, who seemed to me to be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">highest in the scale of evolution, and To-jo, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just a shade nearer the ape, while there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">others who had flatter noses, faces more progna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thous and hairier bodies. The question puzzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Possibly in the outer world the answer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is locked in the bosom of the Sphinx. Who</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows? I do not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thinking the thoughts of a lunatic or a dope-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiend, I fell asleep; and when I awoke, my hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feet were securely tied and my weapons had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been taken from me. How they did it without</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakening me I cannot tell you. It was humil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iating, but it was true. To-jo stood above me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The early light of morning was dimly filtering</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the cave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        A Prisoner and an Escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">u'T'ELL me," he demanded, "how to throw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">A man over my head and break his neck, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am going to kill you, and I wish to know this</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing before you die."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of all the ingenuous declarations I have ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard, this one copped the proverbial bun. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck me as so funny that, even in the face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death, I laughed. Death, I may remark here, had,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, lost much of its terror for me. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become a disciple of Lys' fleeting philosophy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valuelessness of human life. I realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was quite right--that we were but comic fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ures hopping from the cradle to the grave, of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest to practically no other created thing than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves and our few intimates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind To-jo stood So-ta. She raised one hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the palm toward me--the Caspakian equiva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent of a negative shake of the head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me think about it," I parried, and To-jo</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that he would wait until night. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">give me a day to think it over; then he left, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the women left--the men for the hunt, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women, as I later learned from So-ta, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm pool where they immersed their bodies as</seg><seg type="columnLine">did the shes of the Sto-lu. "Ata," explained So-ta,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I questioned her as to the purpose of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">matutinal rite; but that was later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I must have lain there bound and uncomfort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able for two or three hours when at last So-ta</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the cave. She carried a sharp knife--</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine, in fact, and with it she cut my bonds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come!" she said. "So-ta will go with you back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Galus. It is time that So-ta left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Band-lu. Together we will go to the Kro-lu, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">after that the Galus. To-jo will kill you tonight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He will kill So-ta if he knows that So-ta aided</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. We will go together."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will go with you to the Kro-lu," I replied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but then I must return to my own people 'toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beginning.'

I wanted myself to die, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet I clung to life--useless and hopeless and har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowing a thing as it had become. I clung to life</seg><seg type="columnLine">because some ancient, reptilian forbear had clung</seg><seg type="columnLine">to life and transmitted to me through the ages the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most powerful motive that guided his minute brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the motive of self-preservation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last I came to the great barrier-cliffs; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">after three days of mad effort--of maniacal effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">--I scaled them.

Near the summit I came upon a huge cav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern. It is the abode of some mighty winged crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of the Triassic--or rather it was. Now it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine. I slew the thing and took its abode.

I had paused to</seg><seg type="columnLine">put a new point on my quill and stir the crude ink</seg><seg type="columnLine">(which I made by crushing a black variety of berry</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mixing it with water) before attaching my</seg><seg type="columnLine">signature, when faintly from the valley below came</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unmistakable sound which brought me to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, trembling with excitement, to peer eagerly</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward from my dizzy ledge. How full of mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that sound was to me you may guess when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you that it was the report of a firearm! For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment my gaze traversed the landscape beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it was caught and held by four figures near</seg><seg type="columnLine">1146</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the base of the cliff--a human figure held at bay</seg><seg type="columnLine">by three hyaenodons, those ferocious and blood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirsty wild dogs of the Eocene. A fourth beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay dead or dying near by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I couldn't be sure, looking down from above as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was; but yet I trembled like a leaf in the intuitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">belief that it was Lys, and my judgment served to</seg><seg type="columnLine">confirm my wild desire, for whoever it was carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a pistol, and thus had Lys been armed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">first wave of sudden joy which surged through me</seg><seg type="columnLine">was short-lived in the face of the swift-following</seg><seg type="columnLine">conviction that the one who fought below was</seg><seg type="columnLine">already doomed. Luck and only luck it must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been which had permitted that first shot to lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">low one of the savage creatures, for even such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy weapon as my pistol is entirely inadequate</seg><seg type="columnLine">against even the lesser carnivora of Caspak. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment the three would charge! a futile shot would</seg><seg type="columnLine">but tend more greatly to enrage the one it chanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hit; and then the three would drag down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little human figure and tear it to pieces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And maybe it was Lys! My heart stood still at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thought, but mind and muscle responded to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick decision I was forced to make. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a single hope--a single chance--and I took it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I raised my rifle to my shoulder and took careful</seg><seg type="columnLine">aim. It was a long shot, a dangerous shot, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless one is accustomed to it, shooting from a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderable altitude is most deceptive work. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is, though, something about marksmanship which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite beyond all scientific laws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon rio other theory can I explain my marks-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manship of that moment. Three times my rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke--three quick, short syllables of death.

The last</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred feet is over a steep incline of</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose rubble to the valley bottom, and I had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the top of this when there arose to my ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">an agonized cry--"Bowen! Bowen! Quick, my love,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Lys Found and in Danger</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1HAD been too much occupied with the dangers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the descent to glance down toward the valley;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that cry which told me that it was indeed Lys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that she was again in danger, brought my eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly upon her in time to see a hairy, burly</seg><seg type="columnLine">brute seize her and start off at a run toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">near-by wood. From rock to rock, chamoislike, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped downward toward the valley, in pursuit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lys and her hideous abductor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was heavier than I by many pounds, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighted by the burden he carried that I easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">overtook him; and at last he turned, snarling, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">face me. It was Kho of the tribe of Tsa, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatchet-men. He recognized me, and with a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">growl he threw Lys aside and came for me. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">she is mine," he cried. "I kill! I kill!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had to discard my rifle before I commenced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid descent of the cliff, so that now I was armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">only with a hunting knife, and this I whipped from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">its scabbard as Kho leaped toward me. He was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty beast, mightily muscled, and the urge that</seg><seg type="columnLine">has made males fight since the dawn of life on earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled him with blood-lust and the thirst to slay;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not one whit less did it fill me with the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">primal passions. Two abysmal beasts sprang at</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other's throats that day beneath the shadow of</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's oldest cliffs--the man of now and the man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of the earliest, forgotten then, imbued by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same deathless passion that has come down un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed through all the epochs, periods and eras</seg><seg type="columnLine">of time from the beginning, and which shall con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinue to the incalculable end--woman, the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perishable Alpha and Omega of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kho closed and sought my jugular with his teeth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He seemed to forget the hatchet dangling by its</seg><seg type="columnLine">aurochs-hide thong at his hip, as I forgot, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, the dagger in my hand. And I doubt not</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that Kho would easily have bested me in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">encounter of that sort had not Lys' voice awakened</seg><seg type="columnLine">within my momentarily reverted brain the skill</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cunning of reasoning man. "Bowen!" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried. "Your knife! Your knife!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was enough. It recalled me from the forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">eon to which my brain had flown and left me once</seg><seg type="columnLine">again a modern man battling with a clumsy, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skilled brute. No longer did my jaws snap at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hairy throat before me; but instead my knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought and found a space between two ribs over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the savage heart. Kho voiced a single horrid</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream, stiffened spasmodically and sank to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. And Lys threw herself into my arms. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fears and sorrows of the past were wiped away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and once again I was the happiest of men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With some misgivings I shortly afterward cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eyes upward toward the precarious ledge which</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran before my cave, for it seemed to me quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond all reason to expect a dainty modern belle</seg><seg type="columnLine">to essay the perils of that frightful climb. I asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">her if she thought she could brave the ascent, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she laughted gayly in my face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Watch!" she cried, and ran eagerly toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">base of the cliff. Like a squirrel she clambered</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly aloft, so that I was forced to exert myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep pace with her. At first she frightened me;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but presently I was aware that she was quite as</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe here as I was. When we finally came to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge and I again held her in my arms, she re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">called to my mind that for several weeks she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been living the life of a cave-girl with the tribe of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatchet-men.. They had been driven from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">former caves by another tribe which had slain</seg><seg type="columnLine">many and carried off quite half the females, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new cliffs to which they had flown had proven</seg><seg type="columnLine">far higher and more precipitous, so that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become, through necessity, a most practiced</seg><seg type="columnLine">climber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She told me of Kho's desire for her, since all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">females had been stolen and of how her life had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a constant nightmare of terror as she sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">by night and by day to elude the great brute. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time Nobs had been all the protection she re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired; but one day he disappeared--nor has she</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen him since. She believes that he was delib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erately made away with; and so do I, for we both</seg><seg type="columnLine">are sure that he never would have deserted her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With her means of protection gone, Lys was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the mercy of the hatchet-man; nor was it many</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1147</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hours before he had caught her at the base of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff and seized her; but as he bore her triumph-</seg><seg type="columnLine">antly aloft toward his cave, she had managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">break loose and escape him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For three days he has pursued me," she said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"through this horrible world. How I have passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through in safety I cannot guess, or how I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">always managed to outdistance him; yet I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done it, until just as you discovered me. Fate was</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind to us, Bowen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded my head in assent and crushed her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. And then we talked and planned as I cooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">antelope-steaks over my fire, and we came to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conclusion that there was no hope of rescue, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she and I were doomed to live and die upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caprona. Well, it might be worse!

Tyler, Jr., had taken passage for France</seg><seg type="columnLine">to join the American Ambulance was a well-known</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, and I had further substantiated by wire to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York office of the owners, that a Miss La Rue</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad been booked for passage. Further, neither she</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor Bowen had been mentioned among the list of</seg><seg type="columnLine">survivors; nor had the body of either of them been</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their rescue by the English tug was entirely prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able; Me capture of the enemy Z7-33 by the tug's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">crew was not beyond the range of possibility; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their adventures during the perilous cruise which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the treachery and deceit of Benson extended until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they found themselves in the waters of the far</seg><seg type="columnLine">South Pacific with depleted stores and poisoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">water-casks, while bordering upon the fantastic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared logical enough as narrated, event by</seg><seg type="columnLine">event, in the manuscript.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Caprona has always been considered a more or</seg><seg type="columnLine">less mythical land, though it is vouched for by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">eminent navigator of the eighteenth century; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bowen's narrative made it seem very real, however</seg><seg type="columnLine">many miles of trackless ocean lay between us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Yes, that narrative had us guessing. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were agreed that it was most improbable; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither of us could say that anything which it con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained was beyond the range of possibility. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird flora and fauna of Caspak were as possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the thick, warm atmospheric conditions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the superheated crater as they were in the Mesozoic</seg><seg type="columnLine">era under almost exactly similar conditions, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were then probably world-wide. The assistant sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">retary had heard of Caproni and his discoveries</seg><seg type="columnLine">but admitted that he never had taken much stock</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the one or the other. We were agreed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one statement most difficult of explanation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that which reported the entire absence of human</seg><seg type="columnLine">young among the various tribes with which Tyler</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had intercourse. This was the one irrecon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cilable statement of the manuscript. A world of</seg><seg type="columnLine">adults! It was impossible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Planning a Rescue from the Island</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE speculated upon the probable fate of Brad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley and his party of English sailors.

And Miss La Rue--</seg><seg type="columnLine">could a young girl long have survived the horrors of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caspak after having been separated from all of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">own kind? The assistant secretary wondered if</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nobs still was with her, and then we both smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this tacit acceptance of the truth of the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncanny tale.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1148</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose I'm a fool," remarked the assistant</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretary; "but by George, I can't help believing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and I can see that girl now, with the big Aire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dale at her side protecting her from the terrors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a million years ago. I can visualize the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene--the apelike Grimaldi men huddled in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">filthy caves; the huge pterodactyls soaring through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy air upon their batlike wings; the mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinosaurs moving their clumsy hulks beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark shadows of pre-glacial forests--the dragons</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we considered myths until science taught us</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were the true recollections of the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, handed down through countless ages by word</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mouth from father to son out of the unrecorded</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn of humanity."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is stupendous--if true," I replied.

I can't help hoping all the time that Bowen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the girl have found the others; the last that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bowen knew of them, there were six left, all told--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mate Bradley, the engineer Olson, and Wilson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitely, Brady and Sinclair.

"My God!" he exclaimed as he hung up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">receiver as one in a trance. "It can't be!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Tyler is dead," he answered in a dull voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He died at sea, suddenly, yesterday."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next ten days were occupied in burying Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bowen J. Tyler, Sr., and arranging plans for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">succor of his son. Mr. Tom Billings, the late Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tyler's secretary, did it all. He is force, energy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">initiative and good judgment combined and per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonified. I never have beheld a more dynamic</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man. He handled lawyers, courts and execu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors as a sculptor handles his modeling clay. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed, fashioned and forced them to his will. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a classmate of Bowen Tyler at college, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fraternity brother, and before that he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">an impoverished and improvident cow-puncher on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the great Tyler ranches. Tyler, Sr., had</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked him out of thousands of employees and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; or rather Tyler had given him the opportunity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then Billings had made himself. Tyler, Jr.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as good a judge of men as his father, had taken him</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his friendship, and between the two of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had turned out a man who would have died</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for a Tyler as quickly as he would have for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">flag. Yet there was none of the sycophant or</seg><seg type="columnLine">fawner in Billings; ordinarily I do not wax en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thusiastic about men, but this man Billings comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">as close to my conception of what a regular man</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be as any I have ever met. I venture to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">that before Bowen J. Tyler sent him to college he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never heard the word ethics, and yet I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally sure that in all his life he never has trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gressed a single tenet of the code of ethics of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">American gentleman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Finding Caprona The Seaplane</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TEN days after they brought Mr. Tyler's body</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the Toreador, we steamed out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pacific in search of Caprona. There were forty in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the party, including the master and crew of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toreador; and Billings the indomitable was in com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand. We had a long and uninteresting search for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caprona, for the old map upon which the assistant</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretary had finally located it was most inaccurate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When its grim walls finally rose out of the ocean's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mists before us, we were so far south that it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">question as to whether we were in the South Pacific</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the Antarctic. Bergs were numerous, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very cold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All during the trip Billings had steadfastly evad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed questions as to how we were to enter Caspak after</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had found Caprona. Bowen Tyler's manuscript</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made it perfectly evident to all that the subter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranean outlet of the Caspakian river was the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of ingress or egress to the crater world be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the impregnable cliffs. Tyler's party had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to navigate this channel because their craft had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a submarine; but the Toreador could as easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">have flown over the cliffs as sailed under them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy Hollis and Colin Short whiled away many an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour inventing schemes for surmounting the ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stacle presented by the barrier cliffs, and making</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridiculous wagers as to which one Tom Billings had</seg><seg type="columnLine">in mind; but immediately we were all assured that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had raised Caprona, Billings called us together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There was no use in talking about these things,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, "until we found the island. At best it can</seg><seg type="columnLine">be but conjecture on our part until we have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to scrutinize the coast closely. Each of us has</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed a mental picture of the Capronian seacoast</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Bowen's manuscript, and it is not likely that</seg><seg type="columnLine">any two of these pictures resemble each other, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">that any of them resembles the coast as we shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently find it. I have in view three plans for</seg><seg type="columnLine">scaling the cliffs, and the means for carrying out</seg><seg type="columnLine">each is in the hold. There is an electric drill with</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty of water-proof cable to reach from the ship's</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamos to the cliff-top when the Toreador is an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chored at a safe distance from shore, and there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient half-inch iron rod to build a ladder from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the base to the top of the cliff. It would be a long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">arduous and dangerous work to bore the holes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">insert the rungs of the ladder from the bottom up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward ; yet it can be done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I also have a life-saving mortar with which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be able to throw a line over the summit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliffs; but this plan would necessitate one of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing to the top with the chances more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">even that the line would cut at the summit, or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooks at the upper end would slip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"My third plan seems to me the most feasible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1149</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">You all saw a number of large, heavy boxes lowered</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the hold before we sailed. I know you did, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause you asked me what they contained and com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented upon the large letter 'H' which was painted</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon each box. These boxes contain the various</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts of a hydro-aeroplane. I purpose assembling</seg><seg type="columnLine">this upon the strips of beach described in Bowen's</seg><seg type="columnLine">manuscript--the beach where he found the dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of the apelike man--provided there is suffic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ient space a^ove high water; otherwise we shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to assemble it on deck and lower it over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. After it is assembled, I shall carry tackle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ropes to the cliff-top, and then it will be compara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively simple to hoist the search-party and its sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plies in safety. Or I can make a sufficient number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trips to land the entire party in the valley be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the barrier; all will depend, of course, upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">what my first reconnaissance reveals."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That afternoon we steamed slowly along the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Caprona's towering barrier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see now," remarked Billings as we craned</seg><seg type="columnLine">our necks to scan the summit thousands of feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">above us, "how futile it would have been to waste</seg><seg type="columnLine">our time in working out details of a plan to sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mount those." And he jerked his thumb toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs. "It would take weeks, possibly months, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">construct a ladder to the top. I had no conception</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their formidable height. Our mortar would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry a line halfway to the crest of the lowest point.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is no use discussing any plan other than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hydro-aeroplane. We'll find the beach and get busy."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Late the following morning the lookout announced</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could discern surf about a mile ahead; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we approached, we all saw the line of breakers</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken by a long sweep of rolling surf upon a nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row beach. The launch was lowered, and five of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a landing, getting a good ducking in the ice-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold waters in the doing of it; but we were rewarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the finding of the clean-picked bones of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been the skeleton of a high order of ape</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a very low order of man, lying close to the base</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cliff. Billings was satisfied, as were the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us, that this was the beach mentioned by Bowen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we further found that there was ample room</seg><seg type="columnLine">to assemble the seaplane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Disappearance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BILLINGS, having arrived at a decision, lost no</seg><seg type="columnLine">time in acting, with the result that before mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon we had landed all the large boxes marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">"H" upon the beach, and were busily engaged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening them. Two days later the plane was as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembled and tuned. We loaded tackles and ropes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, food and ammunition in it, and then we each</seg><seg type="columnLine">implored Billings to let us be the one to accompany</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. But he would take no one. That was Billings;</seg><seg type="columnLine">if there was any especially difficult or dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">work to be done, that one man could do, Billings</seg><seg type="columnLine">always did it himself. If he needed assistance, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">never called for volunteers--just selected the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">or men he considered best qualified for the duty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He said that he considered the principles underly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing all volunteer service fundamentally wrong, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it seemed to him that calling for volunteers</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflected upon the courage and loyalty of the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">command.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We rolled the plane down to the water's edge, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billings mounted the pilot's seat. There was a mo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ment's delay as he assured himself that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything necessary. Jimmy Hollis went over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">armament and ammunition to see that nothing had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been omitted. Besides pistol and rifle, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine-gun mounted in front of him on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane, and ammunition for all three. Bowen's ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">count of the terrors of Caspak had impressed us all</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the necessity for proper means of defense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last all was ready. The motor was started, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we pushed the plane out into the surf. A moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, and she was skimming seaward. Gently she</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose from the surface of the water, executed a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiral as she mounted rapidly, circled once far</seg><seg type="columnLine">above us and then disappeared over the crest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs. We all stood silent and expectant, our eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">glued upon the towering summit above us. Hollis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was now in command, consulted his wrist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch at frequent intervals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gad," exclaimed Short, "we ought to be hear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from him pretty soon!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hollis laughed nervously. "He's been gone only</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten minutes," he announced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Seems like an hour," snapped Short. "What's</seg><seg type="columnLine">that? Did you hear that? He's firing! It's the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine-gun! Oh, Lord; and here we are as helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a lot of old ladies ten thousand miles away! We</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't do a thing.

We could hear it</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinctly for at least a minute. Then came silence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was two weeks ago.

From the plane I looked down through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a njist upon the blurred landscape beneath me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The hot, humid atmosphere of Caspak condenses as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is fanned by the cold Antarctic air-currents</seg><seg type="columnLine">which sweep across the crater's top, sending a ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uous ribbon of vapor far out across the Pacific.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through this the picture gave one the suggestion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a colossal impressionistic canvrs in greens and</seg><seg type="columnLine">browns and scarlets and yellows surrounding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep blue of the inland sea--just blobs of color</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking form through the tumbling mist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I dived close to the cliffs and skirted them for</seg><seg type="columnLine">several miles without finding the least indication</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a suitable landing-place; and then I swung back</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a lower level, looking for a clearing close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom of the mighty escarpment; but I could find</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of sufficient area to insure safety. I was fly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing pretty low by this time, not only looking for</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing places but watching the myriad life be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath me. I was down pretty well toward the south</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the island, where an arm of the lake reaches</seg><seg type="columnLine">far inland, and I could see the surface of the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">literally black with creatures of some sort. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too far up to recognize individuals, but the general</seg><seg type="columnLine">impression was of a vast army of amphibious mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sters. The land was almost equally alive with</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawling, leaping, running, flying things. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the latter which nearly did for me while my</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention was fixed upon the weird scene below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first intimation I had of it was the sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">blotting out of the sunlight from above, and as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced quickly up, I saw a most terrific creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">1150</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">swooping down upon me. It must have been fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighty feet long from the end of its long, hideous</seg><seg type="columnLine">beak to the tip of its thick, short tail, with an equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread of wings. It was coming straight for me</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hissing frightfully--I could hear it above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whir of the propeller. It was coming straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">down toward the muzzle of the machine-gun and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">let it have it right in the breast; but still it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me, so that I had to dive and turn, though I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerously close to earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thing didn't miss me by a dozen feet, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I rose, it wheeled and followed me, but only</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the cooler air close to the level of the cliff-tops;</seg><seg type="columnLine">there it turned again and dropped. Something--</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's natural love of battle and the chase, I pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sume--impelled me to pursue it, and so I too circled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dived. The moment I came down into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm atmosphere of Caspak, the creature came for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me again, rising above me so that it might swoop</seg><seg type="columnLine">down upon me. Nothing could better have suited</seg><seg type="columnLine">my armament, since my machine-gun was pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward at an angle of about 45Â° and could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">either depressed or elevated by the pilot. If I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought some one along with me, we could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">raked the great reptile from almost any position,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as the creature's mode of attack was always</seg><seg type="columnLine">from above, he always found me ready with a hail</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cyf bullets. The battle must have lasted a minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">or more before the thing suddenly turned completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">over in the air and fell to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Bowen and I roomed together at college, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I learned a lot from him outside my regular course.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was a pretty good scholar despite his love of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fun, and his particular hobby was paleontology.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He used to tell me about the various forms of ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal and vegetable life which had covered the globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">during former eras, and so I was pretty well ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quainted with the fishes, amphibians, reptiles, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mammals of paleolithic times. I knew that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that had attacked me was some sort of ptero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dactyl which should have been extinct millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago.

I knew how anxious they would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">for word from me, and I was equally anxious to</seg><seg type="columnLine">relieve their minds and also to get them and our</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplies well within Caspak, so that we might set</seg><seg type="columnLine">off about our business of finding and rescuing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bowen Tyler; but the pterodactyl's carcass had</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely fallen before I was surrounded by at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen of the hideous things, some large, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, but all bent upon my destruction. I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not cope with them all, and so I rose rapidly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them to the cooler strata wherein they dared</seg><seg type="columnLine">not follow; and then I recalled that Bowen's nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rative distinctly indicated that the farther north</seg><seg type="columnLine">one traveled in Caspak, the fewer were the terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">reptiles which rendered human life impossible at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the southern end of the island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There seemed nothing now but to search out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">more northerly landing-place and then return to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Toreador and transport my companions, two by</seg><seg type="columnLine">two, over the cliffs and deposit them at the ren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dezvous. As I flew north, the temptation to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plore overcame me. I knew that I could easily cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caspak and return to the beach with less petrol</seg><seg type="columnLine">than I had in my tanks; and there was the hope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, that I might find Bowen or some of his party.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The broad expanse of the inland sea lured me out</seg><seg type="columnLine">over its waters and as I crossed, I saw at either</seg><seg type="columnLine">extremity of the great body of water an island--â– </seg><seg type="columnLine">one to the south and one to the north; but I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not alter my course to examine either closely, leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that to a later time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The further shore of the sea revealed a much</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrower strip of land between the cliffs and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water than upon the western side; but it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hillier and more open country. There were splen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">did landing-places, and in the distance, toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north, I thought I descried a village; but of that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not positive. However, as I approached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, I saw a number of human figures apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuing one who fled across a broad expanse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">meadow. As I dropped lower to have a better look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at these people, they caught the whirring of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">propellers and looked aloft. They paused an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant--pursuers and pursued; and then they broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">and raced for the shelter of the nearest wood. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most instantaneously a huge bulk swooped down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon me, and as I looked up, I realized that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were flying reptiles even in this part of Caspak. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature dived for my right wing so quickly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing but a sheer drop could have saved me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was already close to the ground, so that my man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">euver was extremely dangerous; but I was in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair way of making it successfully when I saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was too closely approaching a large tree. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort to dodge the tree and the pterodactyl at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time resulted disastrously. One wing touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">an upper branch; the plane tipped and swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">around, and then, out of control, dashed into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches of the tree, where it came to rest, bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered and torn, forty feet above the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hissing loudly, the huge reptile swept close</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the tree in which my plane had lodged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">circled twice over me and then flapped away toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the south. As I guessed then and was to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, forests are the surest sanctuary from these</seg><seg type="columnLine">hideous creatures, which, with their enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread of wing and their great weight, are as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of place among trees as is a seaplane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a minute or so I clung there to my battered</seg><seg type="columnLine">flyer, now useless beyond redemption, my brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbed by the frightful catastrophe that had be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen me. All my plans for the succor of Bowen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Miss La Rue had depended upon this craft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in a few brief minutes my own selfish love of</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventure had wrecked their hopes and mine. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">what effect it might have upon the future of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">balance of the rescuing expedition I could not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess. Their lives, too, might be sacrificed to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">suicidal foolishness. That I was doomed seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">inevitable; but I can honestly say that the fate of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friends concerned me more greatly than did</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond the barrier cliffs my party was even now</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervously awaiting my return. Presently appre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hension and fear would claim them--and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never know! They would attempt to scale</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1151</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliffs--of that I was sure; but I was not so</seg><seg type="columnLine">positive that they would succeed; and after a while</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would turn back, what there were left of them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and go sadly and mournfully upon their return-</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey home. Home! I set my jaws and tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to forget the word, for I knew that I should never</seg><seg type="columnLine">again see home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">On Foot in Caspak</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND what of Bowen and his girl? I had doomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them too. They would never even know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">an attempt had been made to rescue them. If they</seg><seg type="columnLine">still lived, they might some day come upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruined remnants of this great plane hanging in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its lofty sepulcher and hazard vain guesses and be</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with wonder; but they would never know;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I could not but be glad that they would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that Tom Billings had sealed their death-</seg><seg type="columnLine">warrants by his criminal selfishness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All these useless regrets were getting me in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad way; but at last I shook myself and tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">put such things out of my mind and take hold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions as they existed and do my level best to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrest victory from defeat. I was badly shaken up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bruised, but considered myself mighty lucky</seg><seg type="columnLine">to escape with my life. The plane hung at a pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">carious angle, so that it was with difficulty and</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable danger that I climbed from it into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree and then to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My predicament was grave. Between me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friends lay an inland sea fully sixty miles wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this point, and an estimated land-distance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some three hundred miles around the northern end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sea, through such hideous dangers as I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly free to admit had me pretty well buf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faloed. I had seen quite enough of Caspak this</seg><seg type="columnLine">day to assure me that Bowen had in no way exag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerated its perils. As a matter of fact, I am in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clined to believe that he had become so accustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them before he started upon his manuscript that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he rather slighted them. As I stood there beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">that tree--a tree which should have been part of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">coal-bed countless ages since--and looked out across</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sea teeming with frightful life--life which</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have been fossil before God conceived of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adam--I would not have given a minim of stale</seg><seg type="columnLine">beer for my chances of ever seeing my friends or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outside world again; yet then and there I swore</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fight my way as far through this hideous land</seg><seg type="columnLine">as circumstances would permit. I had plenty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ammunition, an automatic pistol and a heavy rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the latter one of twenty added to our equipment</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the strength of Bowen's description of the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts of prey which ravaged Caspak. My greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger lay in the hideous reptilia whose low nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">organizations permitted their carnivorous instincts</seg><seg type="columnLine">to function for several minutes after they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased to live.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But to these things I gave less thought than to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sudden frustration of all our plans. With the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitterest of thoughts I condemned myself for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolish weakness that had permitted me to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn from the main object of my flight into prema-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture and useless exploration. It seemed to me then</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I must be totally eliminated from further</seg><seg type="columnLine">search for Bowen, since, as I estimated it, the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred miles of Caspakian territory I must tra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse to reach the base of the cliffs beyond which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">my party awaited me were practically impassable</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a single individual unaccustomed to Caspakian</seg><seg type="columnLine">life and ignorant of all that lay before him. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not give up hope entirely. My duty lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear before me; I must follow it while life re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained to me, and so I set forth toward the north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The country through which I took my way was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as lovely as it was unusual--I had almost said un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthly, for the plants, the trees, the blooms were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not of the earth that I knew. They were larger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the colors more brilliant and the shapes startling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some almost to grotesqueness, though even such</seg><seg type="columnLine">added to the charm and romance of the landscape</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the giant cacti render weirdly beautiful the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waste spots of the sad Mohave. And the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">shone huge and round and red over all, a monster</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun above a monstrous world, its light dispersed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the humid air of Caspak--the warm, moist air which</seg><seg type="columnLine">lies sluggish upon the breast of this great mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life, Nature's mightiest incubator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All about me, in every direction, was life. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved through the tree-tops and among the boles;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it displayed itself in widening and intermingling</seg><seg type="columnLine">circles upon the bosom of the sea; it leaped above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface; it rose majestic and terrible from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths; I could hear it in a dense wood at my right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the murmur of it rising and falling in ceaseless</seg><seg type="columnLine">volumes of sound, riven at intervals by a horrid</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream or a thunderous roar which shook the earth;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and always I was haunted by that inexplicable sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sation that unseen eyes were watching me, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">soundless feet dogged my trail. I am neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous nor high-strung; but the burden of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponsibility upon me weighed heavily, so that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more cautious than is my wont. I turned often</seg><seg type="columnLine">to right and left and rear lest I be surprised, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I carried my rifle at the ready in my hand. Once I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have sworn that among the many creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimly perceived amidst the shadows of the wood I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a human figure dart from one cover to another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I could not be sure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Fair Native and the Panther</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">F&gt;OR the most part I skirted the wood, making</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasional detours rather than enter those for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bidding depths of gloom, though many times I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to pass through arms of the forest which</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended to the very shore of the inland sea. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so sinister a suggestion in the uncouth sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the vague glimpses of moving things within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest, of the menace of strange beasts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly still stranger men, that I always breathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">more freely when I had passed once more into open</seg><seg type="columnLine">country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had traveled northward for perhaps an hour,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still haunted by the conviction that I was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalked by some creature which kept always just</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden among the trees and shrubbery to my right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a little to my rear, when for the hundredth</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I was attracted by a sound from that direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and turning, saw some animal running rap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">idly through the forest toward me. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer any effort on its part at concealment; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came on through the underbrush swiftly, and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">confident that whatever it was, it had finally gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the courage to charge me boldly. Befoi-e it</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally broke into plain view, I became aware that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not alone, for a few yards in its rear a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">1152</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ond thing thrashed through the leafy jungle. Evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently I was to be attacked in force by a pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting beasts or men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then through the last clump of waving ferns</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke the figure of the foremost creature, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">came leaping toward me on light feet as I stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my rifle to my shoulder covering the point at</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I had expected it would emerge. I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have looked foolish indeed if my surprise and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sternation were in any way reflected upon my</seg><seg type="columnLine">countenance as I lowered my rifle and gazed in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credulous at the lithe figure of the girl speeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly in my direction. But I did not have long</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stand thus with lowered weapon, for as she came,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw her cast an affrighted glance over her</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, and at the same moment there broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the jungle at the same spot at which I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen her, the hugest cat I had ever looked upon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first I took the beast for a saber-tooth tiger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it was quite the most fearsome-appearing beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">one could imagine; but it was not that dread mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster of the past, though quite formidable enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfy the most fastidious thrill-hunter. On it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, grim and terrible, its baleful eyes glaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">above its distended jaws, its lips curled in a fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful snarl which exposed a whole mouthful of for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">midable teeth. At sight of me it had abandoned its</seg><seg type="columnLine">impetuous rush and was now sneaking slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward us; while the girl, a long knife in her hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">took her stand bravely at my left and a little to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my rear. She had called something to me in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange tongue as she raced toward me, and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">she spoke again; but what she said I could not then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, know--only that her tones were sweet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">well modulated and free from any suggestion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Facing the huge cat, which I now saw was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an enormous panther, I waited until I could place</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shot where I felt it would do the most good, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">at best a frontal shot at any of the large carnivora</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a ticklish matter. I had some advantage in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beast was not charging; its head was held low</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its back exposed; and so at forty yards I took</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful aim at its spine at the junction of neck and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders. But at the same instant, as though sens-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing my intention, the great creature lifted its head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leaped forward in full charge. To fire at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sloping forehead I knew would be worse than use-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, and so I quickly shifted my aim and pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trigger, hoping against hope that the soft-nosed</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet and the heavy charge of powder would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient stopping effect to give me time to place a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second shot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In answer to the report of the rifle I had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction of seeing the brute spring into the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning a complete somersault; but it was up</seg><seg type="columnLine">again almost instantly, though in the brief second</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it took it to scramble to its feet and get its</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearings, it exposed its left side fully toward me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a second bullet went crashing through its</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. Down it went for the second time--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then up and at me. The vitality of these creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Caspak is one of the marvelous features of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange world and bespeaks the low nervous organ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ization of the old paleolithic life which has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">so long extinct in other portions of the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I put a third bullet into the beast at three paces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then I thought that I was done for; but it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled over and stopped at my feet, stone dead. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that my second bullet had torn its heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost completely away, and yet it had lived to</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge ferociously upon me, and but for my third</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot would doubtless have slain me before it finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">expired--or as Bowen Tyler so quaintly puts it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before it knew that it was dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Alus</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH the panther quite evidently conscious of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that dissolution had overtaken it, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned toward the girl, who was regarding me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident admiration and not a little awe, though I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must admit that my rifle claimed quite as much of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her attention as did I. She was quite the most won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful animal that I have ever looked upon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what few of her charms her apparel hid, it quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">effectively succeeded in accentuating. A bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft, undressed leather was caught over her left</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder and beneath her right breast, falling upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">her left side to her hip and upon the right to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal band which encircled her leg above the knee</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to which the lowest point of the hide was at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tached. About her waist was a loose leather belt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the center of which was attached the scabbard</seg><seg type="columnLine">belonging to her knife. There was a single armlet</seg><seg type="columnLine">between her right shoulder and elbow, and a series</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them covered her left forearm from elbow to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrist. These, I learned later, answer the purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a shield against knife attack when the left arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">is raised in guard across the breast or face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her masses of heavy hair were held in place by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a broad metal band which bore a large triangular</seg><seg type="columnLine">ornament directly in the center of her forehead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This ornament appeared to be a huge turquoise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the metal of all her ornaments was beaten,</seg><seg type="columnLine">virgin gold, inlaid in intricate design with bits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother-of-pearl and tiny pieces of stone of various</seg><seg type="columnLine">colors. From the left shoulder depended a leop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ard's tail, while her feet were shod with sturdy</seg><seg type="columnLine">little sandals. The knife was her only weapon. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">blade was of iron, the grip was wound with hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">and protected by a guard of three out-bowing strips</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flat iron, and upon the top of the hilt was a knob</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I took in much of this in the few seconds during</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we stood facing each other, and I also ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served another salient feature of her appearance:</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was frightfully dirty! Her face and limbs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">garment were streaked with mud and perspira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and yet even so, I felt that I had never looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon so perfect and beautiful a creature as she.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her figure beggars description, and equally so, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. Were I one of these writer-fellows, I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably say that her features were Grecian, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">being neither a writer nor a poet I can do her</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater justice by saying that she combined all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the finest lines that one sees in the typical Amer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ican girl's face rather than the pronounced sheep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like physiognomy of the Greek goddess. No, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dirt couldn't hide that fact; she was beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond compare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we stood looking at each other, a slow smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to her face, parting her symmetrical lips and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disclosing a row of strong white teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gcdu?" she asked with rising inflection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And remembering that I read in Bowen's manu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">script that Galu seemed to indicate a higher type</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1153</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of man, I answered by pointing to myself and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peating the word. Then she started off on a regular</seg><seg type="columnLine">catechism, if I could judge by her inflection, for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly understood no word of what she said. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time the girl kept glancing toward the forest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at last she touched my arm and pointed in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turning, I saw a hairy figure of a manlike thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing watching us, and presently another and</seg><seg type="columnLine">another emerged from the jungle and joined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader until there must have been at least twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them. They were entirely naked. Their bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">were covered with hair, and though they stood upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">their feet without touching their hands to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, they had a very apelike appearance, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">they stooped forward and had very long arms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite apish features. They were not pretty to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon with their close-set eyes, flat noses, long upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips and protruding yellow fangs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Alus!" said the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had reread Bowen's adventures so often that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew them almost by heart, and so I now knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was looking upon the last remnant of that an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient man-race--the Alus of a forgotten period--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speechless man of antiquity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Razor!" cried the girl, and at the same moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Alus came jabbering toward us. They made</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange growling, barking noises, as with much</seg><seg type="columnLine">baring of fangs they advanced upon us. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed only with nature's weapons--powerful mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cles and giant fangs; yet 1 knew that these were</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite sufficient to overcome us had we nothing bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter to offer in defense, and so I drew my pistol and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired at the leader. He dropped like a stone, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others turned and fled. Once again the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled her slow smile and stepping closer, caressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barrel of my automatic. As she did so, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers came in contact with mine, and a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrill ran through me, which I attributed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that it had been so long since I had seen a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman of any sort or kind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Not a Lady's Man A Dirty Goddess</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE said something to me in her low, liquid</seg><seg type="columnLine">tones; but I could not understand her, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she pointed toward the north and started away. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed her, for my way was north too; but had it</seg><seg type="columnLine">been south I still should have followed, so hungry</seg><seg type="columnLine">was I for human companionship in this world of</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts and reptiles and half-men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We walked along, the girl talking a great deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seeming mystified that I could not understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. Her silvery laugh rang merrily when I in</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn essayed to speak to her, as though my lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guage was the quaintest thing she ever had heard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Often after fruitless attempts to make me under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand, she would hold her palm toward me, saying,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Galu!" and then touch my breast or arm and cry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Alu, alu!" I knew what she meant for I had learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Bowen's narrative the negative gesture and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two words which she repeated. She meant that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was no Galu, as I claimed, but an Alu, or speech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less one. Yet every time she said this she laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and so infectious were her tones that I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">only join her. It was only natural, too, that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be mystified by my inability to comprehend</seg><seg type="columnLine">her or to make her comprehend me, for from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">club-men, the lowest human type in Caspak to have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">speech, to the golden race of Galus, the tongues</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the various tribes are identical except for am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plifications in the rising scale of evolution. She,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who is a Galu, can understand one of the Bo-lu and</seg><seg type="columnLine">make herself understood to him, or to a hatchet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, a spear-man or an archer. The Ho-lus, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">apes, the Alus and myself were the only creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">of human semblance with which she could hold no</seg><seg type="columnLine">converse; yet it was evident that her intelligence</seg><seg type="columnLine">told her that I was neither Ho-lu nor Alu, neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">anthropoid ape nor speechless man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Yet she did not despair, but set out to teach me</seg><seg type="columnLine">her language; and had it not been that I worried</seg><seg type="columnLine">so greatly over the fate of Bowen and my com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions of the Toreador, I could have wished the</seg><seg type="columnLine">period of instruction prolonged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I never have been what one might call a ladies'</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, though I like their company immensely, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">during my college days and since have made vari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous friends among the sex. I think that I rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeal to a certain type of girl for the reason that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I never make love to them; I leave that to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerous others who do it infinitely better than I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hope to, and take my pleasure out of girls'</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobiety in what seem to be more rational ways--</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing, golfing, boating, riding, tennis, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">like. Yet in the company of this half-naked little</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage I found a new pleasure that was entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinct from any that I ever had experienced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When she touched me, I thrilled as I had never be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore thrilled in contact with another woman. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not quite understand it, for I am sufficiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">sophisticated to know that this is a symptom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">love and I certainly did not love this filthy little</seg><seg type="columnLine">barbarian with her broken, unkempt nails and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin so besmeared with mud and the green of</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed foliage that it was difficult to say what</seg><seg type="columnLine">color it originally had been. But if she was out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wardly uncouth, her clear eyes and strong, white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even teeth, her silvery laugh and her queenly car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riage, bespoke an innate fineness which dirt could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not quite successfully conceal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun was low in the heavens when we came</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a little river which emptied into a large bay</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the foot of low cliffs. Our journey so far had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been beset with constant danger, as is every jour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney in this frightful land. I have not bored you</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a recital of the wearying successions of at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacks by the multitude of creatures which were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly crossing our path or deliberately stalking</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. We were always upon the alert; for here, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">paraphrase, eternal vigilance is indeed the price of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I had managed to progress a little in the acqui-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sition of a knowledge of her tongue, so that I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of the animals and reptiles by their Caspakian</seg><seg type="columnLine">names, and trees and ferns and grasses. I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words for sea and river and cliff, for sky and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun and cloud. Yes, I was getting along finely, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then it occurred to me that I didn't know my com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion's name; so I pointed to myself and said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tom." Then I pointed to her and raised my eye-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brows in interrogation. The girl ran her fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">into that mass of hair and looked puzzled. I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated the action a dozen times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tom," she said finally in that clear, sweet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid voice. "Tom!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had never thought much of my name before;</seg><seg type="columnLine">1154</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">but when she spoke it, it sounded to me for the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time in my life like a mighty nice name, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she brightened suddenly and tapped her own breast</seg><seg type="columnLine">and said: "Ajor!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ajor!" I repeated, and she laughed and struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">her palms together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, we knew each other's names now, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was some satisfaction. I rather liked hers---Ajor!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And she seemed to like mine, for she repeated it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Bath in Caspak</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SO we came to the cliffs beside the little river</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it empties into the bay with the great in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land sea beyond. The qliffs were weather-worn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotted, and in one place a deep hollow ran back be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the overhanging stone for several feet, sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesting shelter for the night. There were loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks strewn all about with which I might build a</seg><seg type="columnLine">barricade across the entrance to the cave, and so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted there and pointed out the place to Ajor, try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to make her understand that we would spend</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as she grasped my meaning, she assented</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Caspakian equivalent of an affirmative nod,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then touching my rifle, motioned to me to fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low her to the river. At the bank she paused, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved her belt and dagger, dropping them to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground at her side; then unfastening the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of her garment from the metal leg-band to</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it was attached, slipped it off her left shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der and let it drop to the ground around her feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was done so naturally, so simply and so quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it left me gasping like a fish out of water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turning, she flashed a smile at me and then dived</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the river, and there she bathed while I stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard over her. For five or ten minutes she</seg><seg type="columnLine">splashed about, and when she emerged her glisten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing skin was smooth and white and beautiful.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without means of drying herself, she simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignored what to me would have seemed a necessity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in a moment was arrayed in her simple though</seg><seg type="columnLine">effective costume.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was now within an hour of darkness, and as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nearly famished, I led the way back about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter of a mile to a low meadow where we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen antelope and small horses a short time before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here I brought down a young buck, the report of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my rifle sending the balance of the herd scamper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for the woods, where they were met by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chorus of hideous roars as the carnivora took ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage of their panic and leaped among them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With my hunting-knife I removed a hind-quarter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then we returned to camp. Here I gathered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great quantity of wood from fallen trees, Ajor</seg><seg type="columnLine">helping me; but before I built a fire, I also gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered sufficient loose rock to build my barricade</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the frightful terrors of the night to come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shall never forget the expression upon Ajor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face as she saw me strike a match and light the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindling beneath our camp-fire. It was such an</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression as might transform a mortal face with</seg><seg type="columnLine">awe as its owner beheld the mysterious workings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of divinity. It was evident that Ajor was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfamiliar with modern methods of fire-making.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had thought my rifle and pistol wonderful; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">these tiny slivers of wood which from a magic rub</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">brought flame to the camp hearth were indeed</seg><seg type="columnLine">miracles to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the meat roasted above the fire, Ajor and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried once again to talk; but though copiously filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with incentive, gestures and sounds, the conversa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion did not flourish notably. And then Ajor took</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in earnest the task of teaching me her language.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She commenced, as I later learned, with the simplest</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of speech known to Caspak or for that matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the world--that employed by the Bo-lu. I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">it far from difficult, and even though it was a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">handicap upon my instructor that she could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak my language, she did remarkably well and</seg><seg type="columnLine">demonstrated that she possessed ingenuity and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligence of a high order.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After we had eaten, I added to the pile of fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood so that I could replenish the fire before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance to our barricade, believing this as good a</seg><seg type="columnLine">protection against the carnivora as we could have;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then Ajor and I sat down before it, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lesson proceeded, while from all about us came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird and awesome noises of the Caspakian night</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the moaning and the coughing and roaring of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tigers, the panthers and the lions, the barking and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dismal howling of wolf, jackal and hyaenadon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shrill shrieks of stricken prey and the hissing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great reptiles; the voice of man alone was</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But though the voice of this choir-terrible rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fell from far and near in all directions, reach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at times such a tremendous volume of sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the earth shook to it, yet so engrossed was I</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my lesson and in my teacher that often I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">deaf to what at another time would have filled me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with awe. The face and voice of the beautiful girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">who leaned so eagerly toward me as she tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain the meaning of some word or correct my</seg><seg type="columnLine">pronunciation of another quite entirely occupied my</seg><seg type="columnLine">every faculty of perception. The firelight shone</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon her animated features and sparkling eyes; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">accentuated the graceful motions of her gesturing</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms and hands; it sparkled from her white teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from her golden ornaments, and glistened on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smooth firmness of her perfect skin. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid that often I was more occupied with admira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of this beautiful animal than with a desire for</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge; but be that as it may, I nevertheless</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned much that evening, though part of what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned had naught to do with any new language.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ajor seemed determined that I should speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caspakian as quickly as possible, and I thought I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw in her desire a little of that all-feminine trait</seg><seg type="columnLine">which has come down through all the ages from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first lady of the world--curiosity. Ajor desired</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I should speak her tongue in order that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">might satisfy a curiosity concerning me that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filling her to a point where she was in danger of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bursting; of that I was positive. She was a regu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar little animated question-mark. She bubbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over with interrogations which were never to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied unless I learned to speak her tongue. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes sparkled with excitement; her hand flew in</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressive gestures; her little tongue raced with</seg><seg type="columnLine">time; yet all to no avail. I could say man and tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cliff and lion and a number of other words in</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect Caspakian; but such a vocabulary was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">tantalizing; it did not lend itself well to a very gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral conversation, and the result was that Ajor</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1155</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">would wax so wroth that she would clench her little</seg><seg type="columnLine">fists and beat me on the breast as hard as ever she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could, and then she would sink back laughing as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the humor of the situation captured her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was trying to teach me some verbs by going</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the actions herself as she repeated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper word. We were very much engrossed--so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much so that we were giving no heed to what went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on beyond our cave--when Ajor stopped very sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly, crying: "Razor!" Now she had been try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to teach me that ju meant stop; so when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried Kazor and at the same time stopped, I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment that this was part of my lesson--</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the moment I forgot that kazor means beware.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I therefore repeated the word after her; but when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw the expression in her eyes as they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">directed past me and saw her point toward the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance to the cave, I turned quickly--to see a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hideous face at the small aperture leading out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night. It was the fierce and snarling counte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nance of a gigantic bear. I have hunted silver-tips</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the White Mountains of Arizona and thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">them quite the largest and most formidable of big</seg><seg type="columnLine">game; but from the appearance of the head of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful creature I judged that the largest grizzly I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever seen would shrink by comparison to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensions of a Newfoundland dog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Bear of Caspak</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OUR fire was just within the cave, the smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising through the apertures between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks that I had piled in such a way that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">arched inward toward the cliff at the top. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening by means of which we were to reach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside was barricaded with a few large fragments</seg><seg type="columnLine">which did not by any means close it entirely; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the apertures thus left no large animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">could gain ingress. I had depended most, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon our fire, feeling that none of the dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">nocturnal beasts of prey would venture close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames. In this, however, I was quite evidently in</seg><seg type="columnLine">error, for the great bear stood with his nose not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a foot from the blaze, which was now low, owing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the fact that' I had been so occupied with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">lesson and my teacher that I had neglected to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenish it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ajor whipped out her futile little knife and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to my rifle. At the same time she spoke in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quite level voice entirely devoid of nervousness or</seg><seg type="columnLine">any evidence of fear or panic. I knew she was ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">horting me to fire upon the beast; but this I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not wish to do other than as a last resort, for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quite sure that even my heavy bullets would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not more than further enrage him--in which case</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might easily force an entrance to our cave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead of firing, I piled some more wood upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire, and as the smoke and blaze arose in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast's face, it backed away, growling most fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully; but I still could see two ugly points of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazing in the outer darkness and hear its growls</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumbling terrifically without. For some time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature stood there watching the entrance to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">frail sanctuary while I racked my brains in futile</seg><seg type="columnLine">endeavor to plan some method of defense or escape.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew full well that should the bear make a de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined effort to get at us, the rocks I had piled</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a barrier would come tumbling down about his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">giant shoulders like a house of cards, and that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would walk directly in upon us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ajor, having less knowledge of the effectiveness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of firearms than I, and therefore greater confidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">in them, entreated me to shoot the beast; but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that the chance that I could stop it with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single shot was most remote, while that I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">but infuriate it was real and present; and so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited for what seemed an eternity, watching those</seg><seg type="columnLine">devilish points of fire glaring balefully at us, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening to the ever-increasing volume of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">seismic growls which seemed to rumble upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the bowels of the earth, shaking the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs beneath which we cowered, until at last I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the brute was again approaching the aperture.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It availed me nothing that I piled the blaze high</seg><seg type="columnLine">with firewood, until Ajor and I were near to roast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; on came that mighty engine of destruction</seg><seg type="columnLine">until once again the hideous face yawned its fanged</seg><seg type="columnLine">yawn directly within the barrier's opening. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood thus a moment, and then the head was with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn. I breathed a sigh of relief, the thing had</seg><seg type="columnLine">altered its intention and was going on in search of</seg><seg type="columnLine">other and more easily procurable prey; the fire had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been too much for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But my joy was short-lived, and my heart sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">once again as a moment later I saw a mighty paw</seg><seg type="columnLine">insinuated into the opening--a paw as large around</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a large dish-pan. Very gently the paw toyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the great rock that partly closed the entrance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed and pulled upon it and then very deliber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately drew it outward and to one side. Again came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head, and this time much farther into the cav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern; but still the great shoulders would not pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the opening. Ajor moved closer to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">until her shoulder touched my side, and I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt a slight tremor run through her body, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">otherwise she gave no indication of fear. Involun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarily I threw my left arm about her and drew her</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me for an instant. It was an act of reassurance</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than a caress, though I must admit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and even in the face of death I thrilled at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">contact with her; and then I released her and threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">my rifle to my shoulder, for at last I had reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the conclusion that nothing more could be gained</seg><seg type="columnLine">by waiting. My only hope was to get as many shots</seg><seg type="columnLine">into, the creature as I could before it was upon me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Already it had torn away a second rock and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the very act of forcing its huge bulk through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening it had now made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So now I took careful aim between its eyes; my</seg><seg type="columnLine">right fingers closed firmly and evenly upon the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the stock, drawing back my trigger-finger by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscular action of the hand. The bullet could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">fail to hit its mark! I held my breath lest I swerve</seg><seg type="columnLine">the muzzle a hair by my breathing. I was as steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cool as I ever had been upon a target-range,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I had the full consciousness of a perfect hit in</seg><seg type="columnLine">anticipation; I knew that I could not miss. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, as the bear surged forward toward me, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammer fell--futilely, upon an imperfect cartridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost simultaneously I heard from without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly hellish roar; the bear gave voice to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">series of growls far transcending in volume and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferocity anything that he had yet essayed and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time backed quickly from the cave. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant I couldn't understand what had happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cause this sudden retreat when his prey was</seg><seg type="columnLine">1156</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">practically within his clutches. The idea that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmless clicking of the hammer had frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">him was too ridiculous to entertain. However, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not long to wait before we could at least guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the cause of the diversion, for from without</seg><seg type="columnLine">came mingled growls and roars and the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">great bodies thrashing about until the earth shook.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bear had been attacked in the rear by some</seg><seg type="columnLine">other mighty beast, and the two were now locked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a titanic struggle for supremacy. With brief res-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pites, during which we could hear the labored</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing of the contestants, the battle continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the better part of an hour until the sounds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">combat grew gradually less and finally ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At Ajor's suggestion, made by signs and a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the words we knew in common, I moved the fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly to the entrance to the cave so that a beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to pass directly through the flames to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach us, and then we sat and waited for the victor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the battle to come and claim his reward; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">though we sat for a long time with our eyes glued</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the opening, we saw no sign of any beast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last I signed to Ajor to lie down, for I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she must have sleep, and I sat on guard until</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly morning, when the girl awoke and insisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I take some rest; nor would she be denied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but dragged me down as she laughingly menaced</seg><seg type="columnLine">me with her knife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN I awoke, it was daylight, and I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ajor squatting before a fine bed of coals</seg><seg type="columnLine">roasting a large piece of antelope-meat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Believe me, the sight of the new day and the deli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious odor of the cooking meat filled me with re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">newed happiness and hope that had been all but</seg><seg type="columnLine">expunged by the experience of the previous night;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and perhaps the slender figure of the bright-faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl proved also a potent restorative. She looked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smiled at me, showing those perfect teeth, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimpling with evident happiness--the most adorable</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture that I had ever seen. I recall that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">then I first regretted that she was only a little un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tutored savage and so far beneath me in the scale</seg><seg type="columnLine">of evolution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her first act was to beckon me to follow her out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, and there she pointed to the explanation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our rescue from the bear--a huge saber-tooth tiger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its fine coat and its flesh torn to ribbons, lying dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few paces from our cave, and beside it, equally</seg><seg type="columnLine">mangled, and disemboweled, was the carcass of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge cave-bear. To have had one's life saved by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a saber-tooth tiger, and in the twentieth century</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the bargain, was an experience that was to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">the least unique; but it had happened--I had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proof of it before my eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So enormous are the great carnivora of Caspak</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they must feed perpetually to support their</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant thews, and the result is that they will eat the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meat of any other creature and will attack anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">that comes within their ken, no matter how formid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able the quarry. From later observation--I men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion this as worthy the attention of paleontologists</seg><seg type="columnLine">and naturalists--I came to the conclusion that</seg><seg type="columnLine">such creatures as the cave-bear, the cave-lion and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saber-tooth tiger, as well as the larger carnivor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous reptiles make, ordinarily, two kills a day--one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in the morning and one after nightfall. They im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately devour the entire carcass, after which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they lie up and sleep for a few hours. Fortunately</seg><seg type="columnLine">their numbers are comparatively few; otherwise</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would be no other life within Caspak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is their very voracity that keeps their numbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to a point which permits other forms of life</seg><seg type="columnLine">to persist, for even in the season of love the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">males often turn upon their own mates and devour</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, while both males and females occasionally</seg><seg type="columnLine">devour their young. How the human and semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">human races have managed to survive during all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the countless ages that these conditions must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">existed here is quite beyond me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After breakfast Ajor and I set out once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon our northward journey. We had gone but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little distance when we were attacked by a number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of apelike creatures armed with clubs. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed a little higher in the scale than the Alus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ajor told me they were Bo-lu, or club-men. A re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volver-shot killed one and scattered the others; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">several times later during the day we were men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aced by them, until we had left their country and</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered that of the Sto-lu, or hatchet-men. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">people were less hairy and more manlike; nor did</seg><seg type="columnLine">they appear so anxious to destroy us. Rather they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were curious, and followed us for some distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">examining us most closely. They called out to us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ajor answered them; but her replies did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem to satisfy them, for they gradually became</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatening, and I think they were preparing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack us when a small deer that had been hiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some low brush suddenly broke cover and dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">across our front. We needed meat, for it was near</seg><seg type="columnLine">one o'clock and I was getting hungry; so I drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">my pistol and with a single shot dropped the crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture in its tracks. The effect upon the Sto-lu was</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrical. Immediately they abandoned all</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts of war, and turning, scampered for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest which fringed our path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night we spent beside a little stream in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sto-lu country. We found a tiny cave in the rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank, so hidden away that only chance could direct</seg><seg type="columnLine">a beast of prey to it, and after we had eaten of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deer-meat and some fruit which Ajor gathered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we crawled into the little hole, and with sticks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones which I had gathered for the purpose, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">erected a strong barricade inside the entrance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing could reach us without swimming and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wading through the stream, and I felt quite secure</seg><seg type="columnLine">from attack. Our quarters were rather cramped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ceiling was so low that we could not stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, and the floor so narrow that it was with diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culty that we both wedged into it together; but we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were very tired, and so we made the most of it;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so great was the feeling of security that I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure I fell asleep as soon as I had stretched myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside Ajor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Diplodocus</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DURING the three days which followed, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress was exasperatingly slow. I doubt if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we made ten miles in the entire three days. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">country was hideously savage, so that we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to spend hours at a time in hiding from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">or another of the great beasts which menaced us</seg><seg type="columnLine">continually. There were fewer reptiles; but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quantity of carnivora seemed to have increased,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1157</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and the reptiles that we did see were perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic. I shall never forget one enormous speci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men which we came upon browsing upon water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeds at the edge of the great sea. It stood well</seg><seg type="columnLine">over twelve feet high at the rump, its highest point,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with its enormously long tail and neck it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere between seventy-five and a hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in length. Its head was ridiculously small; its body</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unarmored, but its great bulk gave it a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">formidable appearance. My experience of Cas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pakian life led me to believe that the gigantic crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture would but have to see us to attack us, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">I raised my rifle and at the same time drew away</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward some brush which offered concealment;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Ajor only laughed, and picking up a stick, ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the great thing, shouting. The little head</seg><seg type="columnLine">was raised high upon the long neck as the animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupidly looked here and there in search of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">author of the disturbance. At last its eyes dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered tiny little Ajor, and then she hurled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick at the diminutive head. With a cry that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded not unlike the bleat of a sheep, the colossal</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature shuffled into the water and was soon sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">merged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I slowly recalled my collegiate studies and</seg><seg type="columnLine">paleontological readings in Bowen's text-books, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that I had looked upon nothing less than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">diplodocus of the Upper Jurassic; but how in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">finitely different was the true, live thing from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crude restorations of Hatcher and Holland! I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the idea that the diplodocus was a land-animal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but evidently it is partially amphibious. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen several since my first encounter, and in each</seg><seg type="columnLine">case the creature took to the water for conceal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment as soon as it was disturbed. With the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ception of its gigantic tail, it has no weapon of</seg><seg type="columnLine">defense; but with this appendage it can lash so</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific a blow as to lay low even a giant cave-bear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunned and broken. It is a stupid, simple, gentle</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast--one of the few within Caspak which such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">description might even remotely fit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For three nights we slept in trees, finding no</seg><seg type="columnLine">caves or other place of concealment. Here we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were free from the attacks of the large land carni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vora; but the smaller flying reptiles, the snakes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leopards, and panthers were a constant menace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though by no means as much to be feared as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge beasts that roamed the surface of the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the close of the third day Ajor and I were</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to converse with considerable fluency, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a great relief to both of us, especially to Ajor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She now did nothing but ask questions whenever I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would let her, which could not be all the time, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">our preservation depended largely upon the rapid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity with which I could gain knowledge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">geography and customs of Caspak, and accordingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had to ask numerous questions myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I enjoyed immensely hearing and answering her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so naive were many of her queries and so filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder was she at the things I told her of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world beyond the lofty barriers of Caspak; not once</seg><seg type="columnLine">did she seem to doubt me, however marvelous my</seg><seg type="columnLine">statements must have seemed; and doubtless they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the cause of marvel to Ajor, who before had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never dreamed that any life existed beyond Caspak</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the life she knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Artless though many of her questions were, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidenced a keen intellect and a shrewdness which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed far beyond her years or her experience.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Altogether I was finding my little savage a mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting and companionable person, and I often</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanked the kind fate that directed the crossing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our paths. From her I learned much of Caspak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there still remained the mystery that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved so baffling to Bowen Tyler--the total ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sence of young among the ape, the semihuman and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the human races with which both he and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come in contact upon opposite shores of the inland</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea. Ajor tried to explain the matter to me, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was apparent that she could not conceive how</seg><seg type="columnLine">so natural a condition should demand explanation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She told me that among the Galus there were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few babies, that she had once been a baby but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of her people "came up," as she put it, "cor</seg><seg type="columnLine">sva jo," or literally, "from the beginning"; and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they all did when they used that phrase, she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave a broad gesture toward the south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Country of the Band-lu of Caspak</seg><seg type="columnLine">utT'OR long," she explained, leaning very close to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> -T me and whispering the words into my ear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the while she cast apprehensive glances about and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mostly skyward, "for long my mother kept me</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden lest the Wieroo, passing through the air by</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, should come and take me away to Oo-oh."</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the child shuddered as she voiced the word. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to get her to tell me more; but her terror was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so real when she spoke of the Wieroo and the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Oo-oh where they dwell that I at last desisted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I did learn that the Wieroo carried off only</seg><seg type="columnLine">female babes and occasionally women of the Galus</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had "come up from the beginning." It was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">very mysterious and unfathomable, but I got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea that the Wieroo were creatures of imagination</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the demons or gods of her race, omniscient and</seg><seg type="columnLine">omnipresent. This led me to assume that the Galus</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a religious sense, and further questioning</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought out the fact that such was the case. Ajor</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke in tones of reverence of Luata, the god of</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat and life. The word is derived from two</seg><seg type="columnLine">others: Lua, meaning sun, and ata, meaning vari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously eggs, life, young and reproduction. She told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that they worshiped Luata in several forms, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire, the sun, eggs and other material objects which</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested heat and reproduction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had noticed that whenever I built a. fire, Ajor</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlined in the air before her with a forefinger an</seg><seg type="columnLine">isosceles triangle, and that she did the same in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning when she first viewed the sun. At first I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not connected her act with anything in particu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar; but after we learned to converse and she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained a little of her religious superstitions, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that she was making the sign of the tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle as a Roman Catholic makes the sign of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross. Always the short side of the triangle was</seg><seg type="columnLine">uppermost. As she explained all this to me, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to the decorations on her golden armlets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the knob of her dagger-hilt and upon the band</seg><seg type="columnLine">which encircled her right leg above the knee--</seg><seg type="columnLine">always was the design partly made up of isosceles</seg><seg type="columnLine">triangles, and when she explained the significance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this particular geometric figure, I at once grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">its appropriateness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were now in the country of the Band-lu, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spearmen of Caspak. Bowen had remarked in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrative that these people were analogous to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">1158</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">so-called Cro-Magnon race of the Upper Paleolithic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I was therefore very anxious to see them. Nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was I to be disappointed; I saw them, all right!</seg><seg type="columnLine">We had left the Sto-lu country and literally fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">our way through cordons of wild beasts for two</seg><seg type="columnLine">days when we decided to make camp a little earlier</seg><seg type="columnLine">than usual, owing to the fact that we had reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">a line of cliffs running east and west in which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerous likely cave-lodgings. We were both very</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired, and the sight of these caverns, several of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which could be easily barricaded, decided us to halt</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the following morning. .It took but a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes' exploration to discover one particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern high up the face of the cliff which seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideal for our purpose. It opened upon a narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge where we could build our cook-fire; the open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was so small that we had to lie flat and wriggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it to gain ingress, while the interior was</seg><seg type="columnLine">high-ceiled and spacious. I lighted a faggot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked about; but as far as I could see, the chamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran back into the cliff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Laying aside my rifle, pistol and heavy ammuni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion-belt, I left Ajor in the cave while I went down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to gather firewood. We already had meat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fruits which we had gathered just before reaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliffs, and my canteen was filled with fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. Therefore all we required was fuel, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I always saved Ajor's strength when I could, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not permit her to accompany me. The poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl was very tired; but she would have gone with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me until she dropped, I know, so loyal was she.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was the best comrade in the world, and some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times I regretted and sometimes I was glad that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was not of my own caste, for had she been, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should unquestionably have fallen in love with her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As it was, we traveled together like two boys, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge respect for each other but no softer</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentiment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was little timber close to the base of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs, and so I was forced to enter the wood some</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred yards distant. I realize now how fool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardy was my act in such a land as Caspak, teem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with danger and with death; but there is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain amount of fool in every man; and whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">proportion of it I own must have been in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascendant that day, for the truth of the matter is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I went down into those woods absolutely de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fenseless ; and I paid the price, as people usually do</seg><seg type="columnLine">for their indiscretions. As I searched around in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brush for likely pieces of firewood, my head</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowed and my eyes upon the ground, I suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a great weight hurl itself upon me. I struggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my knees and seized my assailant, a huge, naked</seg><seg type="columnLine">man--naked except for a breechcloth of snake-skin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head hanging down to the knees. The fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">was armed with a stone-shod spear, a stone knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a hatchet. In his black hair were several gay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored feathers. As we struggled to and fro, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was slowly gaining advantage of him, when a score</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his fellows came running up and overpowered me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They bound my hands behind me with long raw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hide thongs and then surveyed me critically. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found them fine-looking specimens of manhood, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most part. There were some among them who</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore a resemblance to the Sto-lu and were hairy;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the majority had massive heads and not unlovely</seg><seg type="columnLine">features. There was little about them to suggest</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ape, as in the Sto-lu, Bo-lu and Alus. I ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pected them to kill me at once, but they did not.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instead they questioned me; but it was evident that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did not believe my story, for they scoffed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Galus have turned you out," they cried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If you go back to them, you will die. If you re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">main here, you will die. We shall kill you; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">first we shall have a dance and you shall dance with</seg><seg type="columnLine">us--the dance of death."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It sounded quite reassuring! But I knew that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not to be killed immediately, and so I took</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. They led me toward the cliffs, and as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached them, I glanced up and was sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw Ajor's bright eyes peering down upon us</seg><seg type="columnLine">'from our lofty cave; but she gave no sign if she</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw me; and we passed on, rounded the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs and proceeded along the opposite face of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">until we came to a section literally honeycombed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with caves. All about, upon the ground and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarming the ledges before the entrances, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of members of the tribe. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">many women but no babes or children, though I</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed that the females had better developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">breasts than any that I had seen among the hatchet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, the club-men, the Alus or the apes. In fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the lower orders of Caspakian man the</seg><seg type="columnLine">female breast is but a rudimentary organ, barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested in the apes and Alus, and only a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">more defined in the Bo-lu and Sto-lu, though al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways increasingly so until it is found about half</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed in the females of the spear-men; yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">never was there an indication that the females had</seg><seg type="columnLine">suckled young; nor were there any young among</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Some of the Band-lu women were quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">comely. The figures of all, both men and women,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were symmetrical though heavy, and though there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were some who verged strongly upon the Sto-lu</seg><seg type="columnLine">type, there were others who were positively hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some and whose bodies were quite hairless. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alus are all bearded, but among the Bo-lu the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard disappears in the women. The Sto-lu men</seg><seg type="columnLine">show a sparse beard, the Band-lu none; and there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">little hair upon the bodies of their women.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The members of the tribe showed great interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">in me, especially in my clothing, the like of which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, they never had seen. They pulled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hauled upon me, and some of them struck me; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the most part they were not inclined to brutal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity. It was only the hairier ones, who most closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembled the Sto-lu, who maltreated me. At last</seg><seg type="columnLine">my captors led me into a great cave in the mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which a fire was burning. The floor was littered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with filth, including the bones of many animals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the atmosphere reeked with the stench of</seg><seg type="columnLine">human bodies and putrifying flesh. Here they fed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, releasing my arms, and I ate of half-cooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">auroch steak and a stew which may have been made</seg><seg type="columnLine">of snakes, for many of the long, round pieces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">meat suggested them most nauseatingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Great Labyrinthian Cavern</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE meal completed, they led me well within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern, which they lighted with torches stuck in</seg><seg type="columnLine">various crevices, in the light of which I saw, to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishment, that the walls were covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">paintings and etchings. There were aurochs, red</seg><seg type="columnLine">deer, saber-tooth tiger, cave-bear, hyaenadon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">many other examples of the fauna of Caspak done</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in colors, usually of four shades of brown, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratched upon the surface of the rock. Often they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were superimposed upon each other until it re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired careful examination to trace out the various</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlines. But they all showed a rather remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">aptitude for delineation which further fortified</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bowen's comparisons between these people and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extinct Cro-Magnons whose ancient art is still pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served in the caverns of Niaux and Le Portel. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Band-lu, however, did not have the bow and arrow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in this respect they differ from their extinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">progenitors, or descendants, of Western Europe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Should any of my friends chance to read the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story of my adventures upon Caprona, I hope they</seg><seg type="columnLine">will not be bored by these diversions, and if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are, I can only say that I am writing my memoirs</seg><seg type="columnLine">principally for my own edification and therefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting down those things which interested me par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticularly at the time. I have no desire that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">general public should ever have access to these</seg><seg type="columnLine">pages; but it is possible that my friends may, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">also certain savants who are interested; and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, while I do not apologize for my philosophiz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, I humbly explain that they are witnessing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gropings of a finite mind after the infinite, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">search for explanations of the inexplicable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a far recess of the cavern my captors bade me</seg><seg type="columnLine">halt. Again my hands were secured, and this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">my feet as well. During the operation they ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned me, and I was mighty glad that the marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">similarity between the various tribal tongues of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caspak enabled us to understand each other per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly, even though they were unable to believe or</seg><seg type="columnLine">even to comprehend the truth of my origin and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances of my advent in Caspak; and finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">they left me saying that they would come for me</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the dance of death upon the morrow. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore they departed with their torches, I saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had not been conducted to the farthest extremity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cavern, for a dark and gloomy corridor led</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond my prison room into the heart of the cliff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could not but marvel at the immensity of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">great underground grotto. Already I had traversed</seg><seg type="columnLine">several hundred yards of it, from many points of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which other corridors diverged. The whole cliff</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be honeycombed with apartments and passages</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which this community occupied but a compara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively small part, so that the possibility of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more remote passages being the lair of savage beasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had other means of ingress and egress than</seg><seg type="columnLine">that used by the Band-lu filled me with dire fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I believe that I am not ordinarily hysterically ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehensive ; yet I must confess that under the condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions with which I was confronted, I felt my nerves</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be somewhat shaken. On the morrow I was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">die some sort of nameless death for the diversion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a savage horde, but the morrow held fewer ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rors for me than the present, and I submit to any</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair-minded man if it is not a terrifying thing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie bound hand and foot in the Stygian blackness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an immense cave peopled by unknown dangers in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a land overrun by hideous beasts and reptiles of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest ferocity. At any moment, perhaps at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">very moment, some silent-footed beast of prey might</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch my scent where it laired in some contiguous</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage, and might creep stealthily upon me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">craned my neck about, and stared through the inky</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness for the twin spots of blazing hate which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew would herald the coming of my executioner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So real were the imaginings of my overwrought</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain that I broke into a cold sweat in absolute</seg><seg type="columnLine">conviction that some beast was close before me; yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hours dragged, and no sound broke the gravelike</seg><seg type="columnLine">stillness of the cavern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">This Goddess in the Cave</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DURING that period of eternity many events of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my life passed before my mental vision, a vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">parade of friends and occurrences which would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">blotted out forever on the morrow. I cursed myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the foolish act which had taken me from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">search-party that so depended upon me, and I won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered what progress, if any, they had made. Were</seg><seg type="columnLine">they etill beyond the barrier cliffs, awaiting my</seg><seg type="columnLine">return ? Or had they found a way into Caspak ? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that the latter would be the truth, for the party</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not made up of men easily turned from a pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose. Quite probable it was that they were already</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching for me; but that they would ever find a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trace of me I doubted. Long since had I come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the conclusion that it was beyond human prowess</seg><seg type="columnLine">to circle the shores of the inland sea of Caspak in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face of the myriad menaces which lurked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every shadow by day and by night. Long since</seg><seg type="columnLine">had I given up any hope of reaching the point where</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had made my entry into the country, and so I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now equally convinced that our entire expedition</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been worse than futile before ever it was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived, since Bowen J. Tyler and his wife could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">by any possibility have survived during all these</seg><seg type="columnLine">long months; no more could Bradley and his party</seg><seg type="columnLine">of seamen be yet in existence. If the superior force</seg><seg type="columnLine">and equipment of my party enabled them to circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">the north end of the sea, they might some day</seg><seg type="columnLine">come upon the broken wreck of my plane hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the great tree to the south; but long before that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my bones would be added to the litter upon the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this mighty cavern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And through all my thoughts, real and fanciful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved the image of a perfect girl, clear-eyed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong and straight and beautiful, with the car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riage of a queen and the supple, undulating grace</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a leopard. Though I loved my friends, their fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed of less importance to me than the fate of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this little barbarian stranger for whom, I had con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced myself many a time, I felt no greater senti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment than passing friendship for a fellow-wayfarer</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this land of horrors. Yet I so worried and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fretted about her and her future that at last I quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgot my own predicament, though I still struggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">intermittently with my bonds in vain endeavor to</seg><seg type="columnLine">free myself; as much, however, that I might hasten</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her protection as that I might escape the fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been planned for me. And while I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus engaged and had for the moment forgotten my</seg><seg type="columnLine">apprehensions concerning prowling beasts, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled into tense silence by a distinct and unmis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">takable sound coming from the dark corridor</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther toward the heart of the cliff--the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">padded feet moving stealthily in my direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I believe that never before in all my life, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">amidst the terrors of childhood nights, have I suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered such a sensation of extreme horror as I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">that moment in which I realized that I must lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound and helpless while some horrid beast of prey</seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">crept upon me to devour me in that utter darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Band-lu pits of Caspak. I reeked with cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat, and my flesh crawled--I could feel it crawl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If ever I came nearer to abject cowardice, I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">recall the instance; and yet it was not that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid to die, for I had long since given myself up</seg><seg type="columnLine">as lost--a few days of Caspak must impress any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one with the utter nothingness of life. The waters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the land, the air teem with death, and one is always</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoured by some other form of life. Life is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheapest thing in Caspak, as it is the cheapest thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on earth and, doubtless, the cheapest cosmic produc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. No, I was not afraid to die; in fact, I prayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for death, that I might be relieved of the frightful-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the interval of life which remained to me--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waiting, the awful waiting, for that fearsome</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast to reach me and to strike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently it was so close that I could hear its</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing, and then it touched me and leaped quick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly back as though it had come upon me unexpect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly. For long moments no sound broke the sepul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chral silence of the cave. Then I heard a movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the part of the creature near me, and again' it</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched me, and I felt something like a hairless</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand pass over my face and down until it touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the collar of my flannel shirt. And then, subdued,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but filled with pent emotion, a voice cried: "Tom!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I think I nearly fainted, so great was the reac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. "Ajor!" I managed to say. "Ajor, my girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">can it be you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Tom!" she cried again in a trembly little</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice and flung herself upon me, sobbing softly. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not known that Ajor could cry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As she cut away my bonds, she told me that from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entrance to our cave she had seen the Band-lu</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming out of the forest with me, and she had fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed until they took me into the cave, which she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen was upon the opposite side of the cliff in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which ours was located; and then, knowing that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do nothing for me until after the Band-lu</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept, she had hastened to return to our cave. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty she had reached it, after having been</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalked by a cave lion and almost seized. I trembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the risk she had run.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had been her intention to wait until after mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, when most of the carnivora would have made</seg><seg type="columnLine">their kills, and then attempt to reach the cave in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I was imprisoned and rescue me. She ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained that with my rifle and pistol--both of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">she assured me she could use, having watched me so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many times--she planned upon frightening the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Band-lu and forcing them to give me up. Brave</seg><seg type="columnLine">little girl! She would have risked her life willingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to save me. But some time after she reached our</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave she heard voices from the far recesses within,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and immediately concluded that we had but found</seg><seg type="columnLine">another entrance to the caves which the Band-lu</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied upon the other face of the cliff. Then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had set out through those winding passages and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">total darkness had groped her way, guided solely</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a marvelous sense of direction, to where I lay.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had had to proceed with utmost caution lest</seg><seg type="columnLine">she fall into some abyss in the darkness, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth she had thrice come upon sheer drops and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been forced to take the most frightful risks to pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. I shudder even now as I contemplate what</seg><seg type="columnLine">this girl passed through for my sake and how she</seg><seg type="columnLine">enhanced her peril in loading herself down with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weight of my arms and ammunition and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">awkwardness of the long rifle which she was unac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">customed to bearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could have knelt and kissed her hand in rever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence and gratitude; nor am I ashamed to say that</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is precisely what I did after I had been freed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my bonds and heard the story of her trials.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brave little Ajor! Wonder-girl out of the dim, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinkable past! Never before had she been kissed;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but she seemed to sense something of the meaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the new caress, for she leaned forward in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark and pressed her own lips to my forehead. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden urge surged through me to seize her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain her to my bosom and cover her hot young</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips with the kisses of a real love, but I did not do</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, for I knew that I did not love her; and to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">kissed her thus, with passion, would have been to</seg><seg type="columnLine">inflict a great wrong upon her who had offered her</seg><seg type="columnLine">life for mine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No, Ajor should be as safe with me as with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">own mother, if she had one, which I was inclined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt, even though she told me that she had once</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a babe and hidden by her mother. I had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to doubt if there was such a thing as a mother in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caspak, a mother such as we know. From the Bo-lu</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Kro-lu there is no word which corresponds</seg><seg type="columnLine">with our word mother. They speak of ata and cor</seg><seg type="columnLine">sva jo, meaning reproduction and from the begiv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning, and point toward the south; but no one has a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wandering Under Ground</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER considerable difficulty we gained what we</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought was our cave, only to find that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not, and then we realized that we were lost in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">labyrinthine mazes of the great cavern. We re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traced our steps and sought the point from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had started, but only succeeded in losing our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves the more. Ajor was aghast--not so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">from fear of our predicament; but that she should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have failed in the functioning of that wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense she possessed in common with most other</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures Caspakian, which makes it possible for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to move unerringly from place to place with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out compass or guide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hand in hand we crept along, searching for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening into the outer world, yet realizing that at</seg><seg type="columnLine">each step we might be burrowing more deeply into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heart of the great cliff, or circling futilely in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vague wandering that could end only in death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the darkness! It was almost palpable, and ut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terly depressing. I had matches, and in some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the more difficult places I struck one; but we</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't afford to waste them, and so we groped our</seg><seg type="columnLine">way slowly along, doing the best we could to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one general direction in the hope that it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">eventually lead us to an opening into the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. When I struck matches, I noticed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls bore no paintings; nor was there other sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">that man had penetrated this far within the cliff,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor any spoor of animals of other kinds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would be difficult to guess at the time we spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandering through those black corridors, climbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">steep ascents, feeling our way along the edges of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottomless pits, never knowing at what moment we</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be plunged into some abyss and always</seg><seg type="columnLine">haunted by the ever-present terror of death by</seg><seg type="columnLine">starvation and thirst. As difficult as it was, I still</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that it might have been infinitely worse had</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had another companion than Ajor--courageous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1161</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">uncomplaining, loyal little Ajor! She was tired and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungry and thirsty, and she must have been dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">couraged; but she never faltered in her cheerful-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. I asked her if she was afraid, and she replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">that here the Wieroo could not get her, and that if</seg><seg type="columnLine">she died of hunger, she would at least die with me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she was quite content that such should be her</seg><seg type="columnLine">end. At the time I attributed her attitude to some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing akin to a doglike devotion to a new master</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been kind to her. I can take oath to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that I did not think it was anything more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whether we had been imprisoned in the cliff for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a day or a week I could not say; nor even now do</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know. We became very tired and hungry; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours dragged; we slept at least twice, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">we rose and stumbled on, always weaker and weak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er. There were ages during which the trend of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridors was always upward. It was heartbreak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing work for people in the state of exhaustion in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we then were, but we clung tenaciously to it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We stumbled and fell; we sank through pure physi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal inability to retain our feet; but always we man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged to rise at last and go on. At first, wherever it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been possible, we had walked hand in hand lest</seg><seg type="columnLine">we become separated, and later, when I saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ajor was weakening rapidly, we went side by side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I supporting her with an arm about her waist. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">still retained the heavy burden of my armament;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but with the rifle slung to my back, my hands were</seg><seg type="columnLine">free. When I too showed indisputable evidences of</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhaustion, Ajor suggested that I lay aside my arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ammunition; but I told her that as it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean certain death for me to traverse Caspak with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out them, I might as well take the chance of dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">here in the cave with them, for there was the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance that we might find our way to liberty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came a time when Ajor could no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk, and then it was that I picked her up in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms and carried her. She begged me to leave her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying that after I found an exit, I could come</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and get her; but she knew, and she knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew, that if ever I did leave her, I could never</seg><seg type="columnLine">find her again. Yet she insisted. I barely had suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficient strength to take a score of steps at a time;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then I would have to sink down and rest for five or</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten minutes. I don't know what force urged me on</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kept me going in the face of an absolute con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viction that my efforts were utterly futile. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">counted us already as good as dead; but even so</seg><seg type="columnLine">I dragged myself along until the time came when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could no longer rise, but could only crawl along a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few inches at a time, dragging Ajor beside me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her sweet voice, now almost inaudible from weak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, implored me to abandon her and save myself--</seg><seg type="columnLine">she seemed to think only of me. Of course I</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't have left her there alone, no matter how</seg><seg type="columnLine">much I might have desired to do so; but the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the matter was that I didn't desire to leave her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What I said to her then came very simply and nat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">urally to my lips. It couldn't very well have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">otherwise, I imagine, for with death so close, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt if people are much inclined to heroics. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would rather not get out at all, Ajor," I said to her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"than to get out without you." We were resting</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a rocky wall, and Ajor was leaning against</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, her head on my breast. I could feel her press</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer to me, and one hand stroked my arm in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">weak caress; but she didn't say anything, nor were</seg><seg type="columnLine">words necessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Daylight in the Cavern and a Meeting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER a few minutes' more rest, we started on</seg><seg type="columnLine">again upon our utterly hopeless way; but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon realized that I was weakening rapidly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently I was forced to admit that I was through.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's no use, Ajor," I said, "I've come as far as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can. It may be that if I sleep, I can go on again</seg><seg type="columnLine">after;" but I knew that that was not true, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end was near. "Yes, sleep," said Ajor. "We will</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep together--forever."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She crept close to me as I lay on the hard floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pillowed her head upon my arm. With the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little strength which remained to me, I drew her up</seg><seg type="columnLine">until our lips touched, and then I whispered:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Good-bye!" I must have lost consciousness almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately, for I recall nothing more until I sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly awoke out of a troubled sleep, during which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamed that I was drowning, to find the cave</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted by what appeared to be diffused daylight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a tiny trickle of water running down the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridor and forming a puddle in the little depression</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which it chanced that Ajor and I lay. I turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eyes quickly upon Ajor, fearful for what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light might disclose; but she still breathed, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">very faintly. Then I searched about for an explana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the light, and soon discovered that it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from about a bend in the corridor just ahead of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at the top of a steep incline; and instantly I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that Ajor and I had stumbled by night al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most to the portal of salvation. Had chance taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">us a few yards further, up either of the corridors</seg><seg type="columnLine">which diverged from ours just ahead of us, we might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been irrevocably lost; we might still be lost;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but at least we could die in the light of day, out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horrid blackness of this terrible cave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tried to rise, and found that sleep had given me</seg><seg type="columnLine">back a portion of my strength; and then I tasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water and was further refreshed. I shook Ajor</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently by the shoulder; but she did not open her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, and then I gathered a few drops of water in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my cupped palm and let them trickle between her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips. This revived her so that she raised her lids,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when she saw me, she smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"What happened?" she asked. "Where are we?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are at the end of the corridor," I replied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and daylight is coming in from the outside world</seg><seg type="columnLine">just ahead. We are saved, Ajor!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She sat up then and looked about, and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite womanlike, she burst into tears. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaction, of course; and then too, she was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">weak. I took her in my arms and quieted her as</seg><seg type="columnLine">best I could, and finally, with my help, she got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her feet; for she, as well as I, had found some slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">recuperation in sleep. Together we staggered up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward toward the light, and at the first turn we saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">an opening a few yards ahead of us and a leaden</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky beyond--a leaden sky from which was falling a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drizzling rain, the author of our little, trickling</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream which had given us drink when we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">most in need of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cave had been damp and cold; but as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled through the aperture, the muggy warmth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Caspakian air caressed and comforted us;</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the'rain was warmer than the atmosphere of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those dank corridors. We had water now, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmth, and I was sure that Caspak would soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">offer us meat or fruit; but as we came to where we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could look about, we saw that we were upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">1162</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">summit of the cliffs, where there seemed little rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son to expect game. However, there were trees, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them we soon descried edible fruits with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we broke our long fast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE SPENT two days upon the cliff-top, rest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and recuperating. There was some</seg><seg type="columnLine">small game which gave us meat, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little pools of rainwater were sufficient to quench</seg><seg type="columnLine">our thirst. The sun came out a few hours after</seg><seg type="columnLine">we emerged from the cave, and in its warmth we</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon cast off the gloom which our recent experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ences had saddled upon us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon the morning of the third day we set out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to search for a path down to the valley. Below</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, to the north, we saw a large pool lying at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot of the cliffs, and in it we could discern the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women of the Band-lu lying in the shallow waters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while beyond and close to the base of the mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrier-cliffs there was a large party of Band-lu</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors going north to hunt. We had a splendid</seg><seg type="columnLine">view from our lofty cliff-top. Dimly, to the west,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could see the farther shore of the inland sea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and southwest the large southern island loomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinctly before us. A little east of north was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the northern island, which Ajor, shuddering, whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered was the home of the Wieroo--the land of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oo-oh. It lay at the far end of the lake and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely visible to us, being fully sixty miles away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From our elevation, and in a clearer atmosphere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would have stood out distinctly; but the air of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caspak is heavy with moisture, with the result that</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant objects are blurred and indistinct. Ajor</seg><seg type="columnLine">also told me that the mainland east of Oo-oh was</seg><seg type="columnLine">her land--the land of the Galu. She pointed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliffs at its southern boundary, which mark the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frontier, south of which lies the country of Kro-lu</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the archers. We now had but to pass through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">balance of the Band-lu territory and that of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kro-lu to be within the confines of her own land;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that meant traversing thirty-five miles of hos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tile country filled with every imaginable terror, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly many beyond the powers of imagination.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would certainly have given a lot for my plane at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that moment, for with it, twenty minutes would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have landed us within the confines of Ajor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We finally found a place where we could slip</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the edge of the cliff to a narrow ledge which</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to give evidence of being something of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">game-path to the valley, though it apparently had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been used for some time. I lowered Ajor at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of my rifle and then slid over myself, and I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">free to admit that my hair stood on end during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">process, for the drop was considerable and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge appallingly narrow, with a frightful drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer below down to the rocks at the base of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff; but with Ajor there to catch and steady me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I made it all right, and then we set off down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail toward the valley. There were two or three</seg><seg type="columnLine">more bad places, but for the most part it was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy descent, and we came to the highest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Band-lu caves without further trouble. Here we</seg><seg type="columnLine">went more slowly, lest we should be set upon by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some member of the tribe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We must have passed about half the Band-lu</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave-levels before we were accosted, and then a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">huge fellow stepped out in front of me, barring</seg><seg type="columnLine">our further progress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are you?" he asked; and then he recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and I him, for he had been one of those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had led me back into the cave and bound me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night that I had been captured. From me his gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to Ajor. He was a fine-looking man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear, intelligent eyes, a good forehead and superb</seg><seg type="columnLine">physique--by far the highest type of Caspakian</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had yet seen, barring Ajor, of course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are a true Galu," he said to Ajor, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">this man is of a different mold. He has the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a Galu, but his weapons and the strange skins</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wears upon his body are not of the Galus nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Caspak. Who is he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is Tom," replied Ajor succinctly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is no such people," asserted the Band-lu</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite truthfully, toying with his spear in a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestive manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Evc'ution of Man in Caspak</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Â«AyTY name is Tom," I explained, "and I am</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> IV1 from a country beyond Caspak." I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">it best to propitiate him if possible, because of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessity of conserving ammunition as well as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoid the loud alarm of a shot which might bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">other Band-lu warriors upon us. "I am from Amer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ica, a land of which you never heard, and I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking others of my countrymen who are in Cas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pak and from whom I am lost. I have no quarrel</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you or your people. Let us go our way in</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are going there?" he asked, and pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am," I replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was silent for several minutes, apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighing some thought in his mind. At last he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke. "What is that?" he asked. "And what is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that?" He pointed first to my rifle and then to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my pistol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are weapons," I replied, "weapons which</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill at a great distance." I pointed to the women</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the pool beneath us. "With this," I said, tapping</seg><seg type="columnLine">my pistol, "I could kill as many of those women as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I cared to, without moving a step from where we</seg><seg type="columnLine">now stand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked his incredulity, but I went on. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">with this"--I weighed my rifle at the balance in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the palm of my right hand--"I could slay one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those distant warriors." And I waved my left hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the tiny figures of the hunters far to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fellow laughed. "Do it," he cried derisively,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and then it may be that I shall believe the balance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your strange story."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I do not wish to kill any of them," I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied. "Why should I?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not?" he insisted. "They would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed you when they had you prisoner. They would</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill you now if they could get their hands on you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they would eat you into the bargain. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know why you do not try it--it is because you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken lies; your weapon will not kill at a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance. It is only a queerly wrought club. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">all I know, you are nothing more than a lowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bo-lu."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why should you wish me to kill your own</seg><seg type="columnLine">people?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are no longer my people," he replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1163</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">proudly. "Last night, in the very middle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, the call came to me. Like that it came into</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head"--and he struck his hands together</seg><seg type="columnLine">smartly once--"that I had risen. I have been wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for it and expecting it for a long time; today</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am a Kro-lu. Today I go out into the coslupak"</seg><seg type="columnLine">(unpeopled country, or literally, no man's land)</seg><seg type="columnLine">"between the Band-lu and the Kro-lu, and there I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion my bow and my arrows and my shield;</seg><seg type="columnLine">there I hunt the red deer for the leathern jerkin</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is the badge of my new estate. When these</seg><seg type="columnLine">things are done, I can go to the chief of the Kro-lu,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he dare not refuse me. That is why you may</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill those low Band-lu if you wish to live, for I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a hurry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why do you wish to kill me?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked puzzled and finally gave it up. "I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know," he admitted. "It is the way in Caspak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If we do not kill, we shall be killed, therefore it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise to kill first whoever does not belong to one's</seg><seg type="columnLine">own people. This morning I hid in my cave till</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others were gone upon the hunt, for I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they would know at once that I had become a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kro-lu and would kill me. They will kill me if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">find me in the coslupak; so will the Kro-lu if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">come upon me before I have won my Kro-lu weapons</seg><seg type="columnLine">and jerkin. You would kill me if you could, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is the reason I know that you speak lies when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you say that your weapons will kill at a great dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance. Would they, you would long since have killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Come! I have no more time to waste in words.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will spare the woman and take her with me to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kro-lu, for she is comely." And with that he ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced upon me with raised spear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Cave Lion</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MY rifle was at my hip at the ready. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so close that I did not need to raise it to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, having but to pull the trigger to send</seg><seg type="columnLine">him into Kingdom Come whenever I chose; but yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hesitated. It was difficult to bring myself to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">a human life. I could feel no enmity toward this</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage barbarian who acted almost as wholly upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinct as might a wild beast, and to the last mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment I was determined to seek some way to avoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">what now seemed inevitable. Ajor stood at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, her knife ready in her hand and a sneer</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her lips at his suggestion that he would take her</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just as I thought I should have to fire, a chorus</seg><seg type="columnLine">of screams broke from the women beneath us. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the man halt and glance downward, and follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his example my eyes took in the panic and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause. The women had, evidently, been quitting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pool and slowly returning toward the caves, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were confronted by a monstrous cave-lion</seg><seg type="columnLine">which stood directly between them and their cliffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the center of the narrow path that led down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pool among the tumbled rocks. Screaming, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women were rushing madly back to the pool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will do them no good," remarked the man, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trace of excitement in his voice. "It will do them</seg><seg type="columnLine">no good, for the lion will wait until they come out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and take as many as he can carry away; and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is one there," he added, a trace of sadness in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone, "who I hoped would soon follow me to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kro-lu. Together have we come up from the be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning." He raised his spear above his head and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">poised it ready to hurl downward at the lion. "She</seg><seg type="columnLine">is nearest to him," he muttered. "He will get her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she will never come to me among the Kro-lu,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or ever thereafter. It is useless! No warrior lives</seg><seg type="columnLine">who could hurl a weapon so great a distance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even as he spoke, I was leveling my rifle upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great brute below; and as he ceased speaking, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeezed the trigger. My bullet must have struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a hair the point at which I had aimed, for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed the brute's spine back of his shoulders and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tore on through his heart, dropping him dead in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks. For a moment the women were as terrified</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the report of the rifle as they had been by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">menace of the lion; but when they saw that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loud noise had evidently destroyed their enemy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they came creeping cautiously back to examine the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carcass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man, toward whom I had immediately turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">after firing, lest he should pursue his threatened</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack, stood staring at me in amazement and ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why," he asked, "if you could do that, did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">not kill me long before?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I told you," I replied, "that I had no quarrel</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you. I do not care to kill men with whom I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">no quarrel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he could not seem to get the idea through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. "I can believe now that you are not of Cas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pak," he admitted, "for no Caspakian would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted such an opportunity to escape him."</seg><seg type="columnLine">This, however, I found later to be an exaggeration,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the tribes of the west coast and even the Kro-lu</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the east coast are far less bloodthirsty than he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have had me believe. "And your weapon!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he continued. "You spoke true words when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought you spoke lies." And then, suddenly: "Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">us be friends!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned to Ajor. "Can I trust him?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," she replied. "Why not? Has he not</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked to be friends?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was not at the time well enough acquainted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Caspakian ways to know that truthfulness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">loyalty are two of the strongest characteristics of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these primitive people. They are not sufficiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">cultured to have become adepts in hypocrisy, trea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son and dissimulation. There are, of course, a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">exceptions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can go north together," continued the war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rior. "I will fight for you, and you can fight for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Until death will I serve you, for you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved So-al, whom I had given up as dead." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw down his spear and covered both his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the palms of his two hands. I looked inquir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly toward Ajor, who explained as best she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this was the form of the Caspakian oath of</seg><seg type="columnLine">allegiance. "You need never fear him after this,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she concluded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What should I do?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take his hands down from before his eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">return his spear to him," she explained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did as she bade, and the man seemed very</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased. I then asked what I should have done had</seg><seg type="columnLine">I not wished to accept his friendship. They told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that had I walked away, the moment that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of sight of the warrior we would have become</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly enemies again. "But I could so easily have</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed him as he stood there defenseless!" I ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1164</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," replied the warrior, "but no man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">good sense blinds his eyes before one whom he does</seg><seg type="columnLine">not trust."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was rather a decent compliment, and it taught</seg><seg type="columnLine">me just how much I might rely on the loyalty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my new friend. I was glad to have him with us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he knew the country and was evidently a fearless</seg><seg type="columnLine">warrior. I wished that I might have recruited a</seg><seg type="columnLine">battalion like him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the women were now approaching the cliffs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">To-mar the warrior suggested that we make our</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to the valley before they could intercept us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they might attempt to detain us and were almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain to set upon Ajor. So we hastened down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow path, reaching the foot of the cliffs but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short distance ahead of the women. They called</seg><seg type="columnLine">after us to stop; but we kept on at a rapid walk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not wishing to have any trouble with them, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">could only result in the death of some of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had proceeded about a mile when we heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">some one behind us calling To-mar by name, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we stopped and looked around, we saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman running rapidly toward us. As she ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached nearer, I could see that she was a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">comely creature, and like all her sex that I had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Caspak, apparently young.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is So-al!" exclaimed To-mar. "Is she mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she follows me thus?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In another moment the young woman stopped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">panting, before us. She paid not the slightest at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention to Ajor or me; but devouring To-mar with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her sparkling eyes, she cried: "I have risen! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have risen!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So-al!" was all that the man could say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," she went on, "the call came to me just be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore I quit the pool; but I did not know that it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to you. I can see it in your eyes, To-mar, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">To-mar! We shall go on together!" And she threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself into his arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a very affecting sight, for it was evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">that these two had been mates for a long time and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had each thought that they were about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be separated by that strange law of evolution which</seg><seg type="columnLine">holds good in Caspak and which was slowly unfold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing before my incredulous mind. I did not then</seg><seg type="columnLine">comprehend even a tithe of the wondrous process,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which goes on eternally within the confines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caprona's barrier cliffs nor am I too sure that I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">even now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To-mar explained to So-al that it was I who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed the cave-lion and saved her life, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ajor was my woman and thus entitled to the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">loyalty which was my due.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first Ajor and So-al were like a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger cats on a back fence, but soon they began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to accept each other under something of an armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">truce, and later became fast friends. So-al was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty fine-looking girl, built like a tigress as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength and sinuosity, but withal sweet and wom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anly. Ajor and I came to be very fond of her, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was, I think, equally fond of us. To-mar was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much of a man--a savage, if you will, but none</seg><seg type="columnLine">the less a man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finding that traveling in company with To-mar</seg><seg type="columnLine">made our journey both easier and safer, Ajor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not continue on our way alone while the novi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiates delayed their approach to the Kro-lu country</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order that they might properly fit themselves in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter of arms and apparel, but remained with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Thus we became well acquainted--to such</seg><seg type="columnLine">an extent that we looked forward with regret to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day when they took their places among their new</seg><seg type="columnLine">comrades and we should be forced to continue upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">our way alone. It was a matter of much concern to</seg><seg type="columnLine">To-mar that the Kro-lu would undoubtedly not re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceive Ajor and me in a friendly manner, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">consequently we should have to avoid these people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would have been very helpful to us could we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made friends with them, as their country</seg><seg type="columnLine">abutted directly upon that of the Galus. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendship would have meant that Ajor's dangers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were practically passed, and that I had accomplished</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully one-half of my long journey. In view of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had passed through, I often wondered what chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had to complete that journey in search of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends. The further south I should travel on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">west side of the island, the more frightful would</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dangers become as I neared the stamping-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grounds of the more hideous reptilia and the haunts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Alus and the Ho-lu, all of which were at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">southern half of the island; and then if I should not</seg><seg type="columnLine">find the members of my party, what was to become</seg><seg type="columnLine">of me? I could not live for long in any portion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caspak with which I was familiar; the moment my</seg><seg type="columnLine">ammunition was exhausted, I should be as good as</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a chance that the Galus would receive</seg><seg type="columnLine">me; but even Ajor could not say definitely whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would or no, and even provided they would,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could I retrace my steps from the beginning, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">failing to find my own people, and return to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">far northern land of Galus? I doubted it. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, I was learning from Ajor, who was more or</seg><seg type="columnLine">less of a fatalist, a philosophy which was as neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary in Caspak to peace of mind as is faith to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">devout Christian of the outer world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE were sitting before a little fire inside a</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe grotto one night shortly after we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">quit the cliff-dwellings of the Band-lu, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">So-al raised a question which it had never occurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me to propound to Ajor. She asked her why she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had left her own people and how she had come so</seg><seg type="columnLine">far south as the country of the Alus, where I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first Ajor hesitated to explain; but at last she</seg><seg type="columnLine">consented, and for the first time I heard the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete story of her origin and experiences. For my</seg><seg type="columnLine">benefit she entered into greater detail of explanation</seg><seg type="columnLine">than would have been necessary had I been a native</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caspakian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am a cos-ata-lo," commenced Ajor, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she turned toward me. "A cos-ata-lo, my Tom, is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman" (lo) "who did not come from an egg and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus on up from the beginning" (cor svc^ jo). "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a babe at my mother's breast. Only among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galus are such, and then but infrequently. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wieroo get most of us; but my mother hid me until</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had attained such size that the Wieroo could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">readily distinguish me from one who had come up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the beginning. I knew both my mother and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my father, as only such as I may. My father is</seg><seg type="columnLine">high chief among the Galus. His name is Jor, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">both he and my mother came up from the begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning; but one of them, probably my mother, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1165</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">completed the seven cycles" (Approximately seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred years), "with the result that their off-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring might be cos-ata-lo, or born as are all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">children of your race, my Tom, as you tell me is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact. I was therefore apart from my fellows in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my children would probably be as I, of a higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">state of evolution, and so I was sought by the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my people; but none of them appealed to me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">cared for none. The most persistent was Du-seen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge warrior of whom my father stood in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderable fear, since it was quite possible that Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen could wrest from him his chieftainship of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galus. He has a large following of the newer</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galus, those most recently come up from the Kro-lu,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as this class is usually much more powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerically than the older Galus, and as Du-seen's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambition knows no bounds, we have for a long time</seg><seg type="columnLine">been expecting him to find some excuse for a break</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Jor the High Chief, my father.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A further complication lay in the fact that Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen wanted me, while I would have none of him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then came evidence to my father's ears that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in league with the Wieroo; a hunter, returning</seg><seg type="columnLine">late at night, came trembling to my father, saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had seen Du-seen talking with a Wieroo in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lonely spot far from the village, and that plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had heard the words: 'If you will help me, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will help you--I will deliver into your hands all</seg><seg type="columnLine">cos-ata-lo among the Galus, now and hereafter; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">for that service you must slay Jor the High Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bring terror and confusion to his followers.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, when my father heard this, he was angry;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he was also afraid--afraid for me, who am</seg><seg type="columnLine">cos-ata-lo. He called me to him and told me what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had heard, pointing out two ways ;n which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">might frustrate Du-seen. The first was that I go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Du-seen as his mate, after which he would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">loath to give me into the hands of the Wieroo or to</seg><seg type="columnLine">further abide by the wicked compact he had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a compact which would doom his own offspring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who would doubtless be as am I, their mother. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">alternative was flight until Du-seen should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been overcome and punished. I chose the latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fled toward the south. Beyond the confines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Galu country is little danger from the Wieroo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who seek ordinarily only Galus of the highest</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders. There are two excellent reasons for this:</seg><seg type="columnLine">One is that from the beginning of time jealousy has</seg><seg type="columnLine">existed between the Wieroo and the Galus as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">which constituted the higher order and therefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would eventually dominate the world. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems generally conceded that that race which first</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaches a point of evolution which permits them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to produce young of their own species and of both</seg><seg type="columnLine">sexes must dominate all other creatures. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wieroo first began to produce their own kind--</seg><seg type="columnLine">after which evolution from Galu to Wieroo ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually until now it is unknown; but the Wieroo</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce only males--which is why they steal our</seg><seg type="columnLine">female young, and by stealing cos-ata-lo they in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crease their own chances of eventually reproducing</seg><seg type="columnLine">both sexes and at the same time lessen ours. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready the Galus produce both male and female; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">so carefully do the Wieroo watch us that few of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the males ever grow to manhood, while even fewer</seg><seg type="columnLine">are the females that are not stolen away. It is in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed a strange condition, for while our greatest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies hate and fear us, they dare not exterminate</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, knowing that they too would become extinct but</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, but could we once get a start, I am sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">when all were true cos-ata-lo there would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolved at last the true dominant race before which</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the world would be forced to bow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Strange Tale of Trouble Continued</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AJOR always spoke of the world as though noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing existed beyond Caspak. She could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem to. grasp the truth of my origin or the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there were countless other peoples outside her</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern barrier-cliffs. She apparently felt that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from an entirely different world. Where it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was and how I came to Caspak from it were mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters quite beyond her with which she refused to</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble her pretty head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," she continued, "and so I ran away to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hide, intending to pass the cliffs to the south of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galu and find a retreat in the Kro-lu country. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be dangerous, but there seemed no other way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The third night I took refuge in a large cave</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cliffs at the edge of my own country; upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the following day I would cross over into the Kro-lu</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, where I felt that I should be reasonably</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe from the Wieroo, though menaced by countless</seg><seg type="columnLine">other dangers. However, to a cos-ata-lo any fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">is preferable to that of falling into the clutches of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the frightful Wieroo, from whose land none returns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I had been sleeping peacefully for several hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I was awakened by a slight noise within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern. The moon was shining brightly, illumining</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entrance, against which I saw silhouetted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dread figure of a Wieroo. There was no escape.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cave was shallow, the entrance narrow. I lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">very still, hoping against hope, that the creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">had but paused here to rest and might soon depart</seg><seg type="columnLine">without discovering me; yet all the while I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he came seeking me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I waited, scarce breathing, watching the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">creep stealthily toward me, its great eyes luminous</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the darkness of the cave's interior, and at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew that those eyes were directed upon me, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Wieroo can see in the darkness better than even*</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lion or the tiger. But a few feet separated us</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I sprang to my feet and dashed madly toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">my menacer in a vain effort to dodge past him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the outside world. It was madness, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for even had I succeeded temporarily, the Wieroo</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have followed me and swooped down upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">me from above. As it was, he reached forth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized me, and though I struggled, he overpowered</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. In the duel his long, white robe was nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">torn from him, and he became very angry, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he trembled and beat his wings together in his rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He asked me my name; but I would not answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and that angered him still more. At last he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged me to the entrance of the cave, lifted me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his arms, spread his great wings and leaping into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air, flapped dismally through the night. I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moonlit landscape sliding away beneath me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then we were out above the sea and on our way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oo-oh, the country of the Wieroo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The dim outlines of Oo-oh were unfolding below</seg><seg type="columnLine">us when there came from above a loud whirring of</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant wings.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wieroo wheeled and dropped almost to sea-level,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then raced southward in an effort to outdistance</seg><seg type="columnLine">our pursuers. The great creatures, notwithstand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their enormous weight, are swift on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings; but the Wieroo are swifter. Even with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">added weight, the creature that bore me maintained</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lead, though he could not increase it. Faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the fastest wind we raced through the night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">southward along the coast. Sometimes we rose to</seg><seg type="columnLine">great heights, where the air was chill and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world below but a blur of dim outlines; But always</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jo-oos stuck close behind us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I knew that we had covered a great distance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the rush of the wind by my face attested the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of our progress, but I had no idea where we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were when at last I realized that the Wieroo was</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakening. One of the jo-oos gained on us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded in heading us, so that my captor had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn in toward the coast. Further and further they</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced him to the left; lower and lower he sank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">More labored was his breathing, and weaker the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroke of his once powerful wings. We were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten feet above the ground when they overtook us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at the edge of a forest. One of them seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Wieroo by his right wing, and in. an effort to</seg><seg type="columnLine">free himself, he loosed his grasp upon me, drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping me to earth. Like a frightened ecca I leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my feet and raced for the sheltering sanctuary</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the forest, where I knew neither could follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">or seize me. Then I turned and looked back to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">two great reptiles tear my abductor asunder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">devour him on the spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was saved; yet I felt that I was lost. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">far I was from the country of the Galus I could but</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess; nor did it seem probable that I ever could</seg><seg type="columnLine">make my way in safety to my native land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Day was breaking; soon the carnivora would</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalk forth for their first kill; I was armed only</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my knife. About me was a strange landscape</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the flowers, the trees, the grasses, even, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">different from those of my northern world, and pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently there appeared before me a creature fully as</seg><seg type="columnLine">hideous as the Wieroo--a hairy man-thing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely walked erect. I shuddered, and then I fled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through the hideous dangers that my forbears had</seg><seg type="columnLine">endured in the earlier stages of their human evo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lution I fled; and always pursuing was the hairy</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster that had discovered me.

They were the speech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less men, the Alus, from whom you rescued me, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom. From then on, you know the story of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventures, and from the first, I would endure them</seg><seg type="columnLine">all again because they led me to you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was very nice of her to say that, and I appre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciated it. I felt that she was a mighty nice little</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl whose friendship anyone might be glad to have;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I wished that when she touched me, those</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar thrills would not run through me. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">most discomforting, because it reminded me of</seg><seg type="columnLine">love; and I knew that I never could love this half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">baked little barbarian. I was very much interested</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her account of the Wieroo, which up to this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had considered a purely mythological creature;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Ajor shuddered so at even the least mention</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the name that I was loath to press the subject</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">upon her, and so the Wieroo still remained a mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Caspakian Races Explained</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHILE the Wieroo interested me greatly, I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">little time to think about them, as our waking</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours were filled with the necessities of existence--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the constant battle for survival which is the chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupation of the Caspakians. To-mar and So-al</seg><seg type="columnLine">were now about fitted for their advent into Kro-lu</seg><seg type="columnLine">society and must therefore leave us, as we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not accompany them without incurring great dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger ourselves and running the chance of endanger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them; but each swore to be always our friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">and assured us that should we need their aid at</seg><seg type="columnLine">any time we had but to ask it; nor could I doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">their sincerity, since we had been so instrumental</seg><seg type="columnLine">in bringing them safely upon their journey toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kro-lu village.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was our last day together. In the after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon we should separate, To-mar and So-al going</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly to the Kro-lu village, while Ajor and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a detour to avoid a conflict with the archers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The former both showed evidence of nervous appre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hension as the time approached for them to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">their entry into the village of their new people, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet both were very proud and happy. They told</seg><seg type="columnLine">us that they would be well received as additions to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tribe always are welcomed, and the more so as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distance from the beginning increased, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher tribes or races being far weaker numerically</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the lower. The southern end of the island</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly swarms with the Ho-lu, or apes; next above</seg><seg type="columnLine">these are the Alus, who are slightly fewer in num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers than the Ho-lu; and again there are fewer</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bo-lu than Alus, and fewer Sto-lu than Bo-lu. Thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">it goes until the Kro-lu are fewer in number than</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of the others; and here the law reverses, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Galus outnumber the Kro-lu. As Ajor ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained it to me, the reason for this is that as evo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lution practically ceases with the Galus, there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">no loss among them on this score, for even the cos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ata-lo are still considered Galus and remain with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. And Galus come up both from the west and</seg><seg type="columnLine">east coasts. There are, too, fewer carnivorous rep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiles at the north end of the island, and not so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of the great and ferocious members of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cat family as take their hideous toll of life among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the races further south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By now I was obtaining some idea of the Cas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pakian scheme of evolution, which partly accounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the lack of young among the races I had so far</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen. Coming up from the beginning, the Cas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pakian passes, during a single existence, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the various stages of evolution, or at least many of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, through which the human race has passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the countless ages since life first stirred</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a new world; but the question which continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">to puzzle me was: What creates life at the begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning, cor sva jo?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had noticed that as we traveled northward from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Alus' country the land had gradually risen until</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were now several hundred feet above the level</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the inland sea. Ajor told me that the Galu</seg><seg type="columnLine">country was still higher and considerably colder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which accounted for the scarcity of reptiles. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">change in form and kinds of the lower animals was</seg><seg type="columnLine">even more marked than the evolutionary stages of</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1167</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">man. The diminutive ecca, or small horse, became</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rough-coated and sturdy little pony in the Kro-lu</seg><seg type="columnLine">country. I saw a greater number of small lions and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tigers, though many of the huge ones still per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted, while the wooly mammoth was more in evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence, as were several varieties of the Labyrinth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">adonta. These creatures, from which God save me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I should have expected to find further south; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some unaccountable reason they gain their</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest bulk in the Kro-lu and Galu countries,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though fortunately they are rare. I rather imag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ine that they are a very early form of life which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is rapidly nearing extinction in Caspak, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherever they are found, they constitute a menace</seg><seg type="columnLine">to all forms of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was mid-afternoon when To-mar and So-al</seg><seg type="columnLine">bade us good-bye. We were not far from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kro-lu village; in fact, we had approached it much</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer than we had intended, and now Ajor and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to make a detour toward the sea while our</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions went directly in search of the Kro-lu</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ajor and I had gone perhaps a mile or two and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were just about to emerge from a dense wood when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw that ahead of us which caused me to draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into concealment, at the same time pushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ajor behind me. What I saw was a party of Band-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lu warriors--large, fierce-appearing men. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of their march I saw that they wrere re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning to their caves, and that if we remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">where we were, they would pass without dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covering us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently Ajor nudged me. "They have a pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oner," she whispered. "He is a Kro-lu."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Prisoner of a Higher Race</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND then I saw him, the first fully developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kro-lu I had seen. He was a fine-looking sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age, ^all and straight, with a regal carriage. To-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mar was a handsome fellow; but this Kro-lu showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly in his every physical attribute a higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane of evolution. While To-mar was just enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the Kro-lu sphere, this man, it seemed to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be close indeed to the next stage of his de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velopment, which would see him an envied Galu.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"They will kill him?" I whispered to Ajor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The dance of death," she replied, and I shud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered, so recently had I escaped the same fate. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed cruel that one who must have passed safely</seg><seg type="columnLine">up through all the frightful stages of human evo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lution within Caspak, should die at the very foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his goal. I raised my rifle to my shoulder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took careful aim at one of the Band-lu. If I hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, I would hit two, for another was directly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ajor touched my arm. "What would you do?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she asked. "They are all our enemies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am going to save him from the dance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death," I replied, "enemy or no enemy," and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeezed the trigger. At the report, the two Band-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lu lunged forward upon their faces. I handed my</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle to Ajor, and drawing my pistol, stepped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in full view of the startled party. The Band-lu did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not run away as had some of the lower orders of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caspakians at the sound of the rifle. Instead, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment they saw me, they let out a series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">demoniac war-cries, and raising their spears above</seg><seg type="columnLine">their heads, charged me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Kro-lu stood silent and statuesque, watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proceedings. He made no attempt to escape,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though his feet were not bound and none of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors remained to guard him. There were ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Band-lu coming for me. I dropped three of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them with my pistol as rapidly as a man might</seg><seg type="columnLine">count to three, and then my rifle spoke close to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">left shoulder, and another of them stumbled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled over and over upon the ground. Plucky little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ajor! She had never fired a shot before in all her</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, though I had taught her to sight and aim and</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to squeeze the trigger instead of pulling it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had practised these new accomplishments often,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but little had I thought they would make a marks-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man of her so quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With six of their fellows put out of the fight so</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily, the remaining six sought cover behind some</seg><seg type="columnLine">low bushes and commenced a council of war. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished that they would go away, as I had no am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munition to waste, and I was fearful that should</seg><seg type="columnLine">they institute another charge, some of them would</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach us, for they were already quite close. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly one of them rose and launched his spear. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the most marvelous exhibition of speed I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever witnessed. It seemed to me that he had scarce</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained an upright position when the weapon was</seg><seg type="columnLine">halfway upon its journey, speeding like an arrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Ajor. And then it was, with that little life</seg><seg type="columnLine">in danger, that I made the best shot I have ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">made in my life. I took no conscious aim; it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though my subconscious mind, impelled by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger power even than that of self-preservation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">directed my hand. Ajor was in danger! Simul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taneously with the thought my pistol flew to posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, a streak of incandescent powder marked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">path of the bullet from its muzzle; and the spear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its point shattered, was deflected from its path.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a howl of dismay the six Band-lu rose from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their shelter and raced away toward the south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned toward Ajor. She was very white and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide-eyed, for the clutching fingers of death had</seg><seg type="columnLine">all but seized her; but a little smile came to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips and an expression of great pride to her eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"My Tom!" she said, and took my hand in hers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was all--"My Tom!" and a pressure of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. Her Tom! Something stirred within my</seg><seg type="columnLine">bosom. Was it exaltation or was it consternation?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Impossible. I turned away almost brusquely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come!" I said, and strode off toward the Kro-lu</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Kro-lu stood watching us with stolid indiffer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence. I presume that he expected to be killed; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he did, he showed no outward sign of fear. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, indicating his greatest interest, were fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon my pistol or the rifle which Ajor still carried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I cut his bonds with my knife. As I did so, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression of surprise tinged and animated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">haughty reserve of his countenance. He eyed me</seg><seg type="columnLine">quizzically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you going to do with me?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are free," I replied. "Go home, if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why don't you kill me?" he inquired. "I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">defenseless."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why should I kill you? I have risked my life</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that of this young lady to save your life. Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore should I now take it?" Of course, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't say "young lady" as there is no Caspakian</seg><seg type="columnLine">1168</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">equivalent for that term; but I have to allow my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self considerable latitude in the translation of Cas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pakian conversation. To speak always of a beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiful young girl as a "she" may be literal; but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems far from gallant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Enmity of the Different Races</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Kro-lu concentrated his steady, level gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon me for at least a full minute. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are you, man of strange skins?" he asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Your she is Galu; but you are neither Galu nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kro-lu nor Band-lu, nor any other sort of man</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I have seen before. Tell me from whence</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes so mighty a warrior and so generous a foe."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is a long story," I replied; "but suffice it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say that I am not of Caspak. I am a stranger here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and--let this sink in--I am not a foe. I have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish to be an enemy of any man in Caspak, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the possible exception of the Galu warrior Du-seen."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Du-seen!" he exclaimed. "You are an enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Du-seen? And why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because he would harm Ajor," I replied. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">know him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He cannot know him," said Ajor. "Du-seen rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Kro-lu long ago, taking a new name, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">all do when they enter a new sphere. He cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">know him, as there is no intercourse between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kro-lu and the Galu."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The warrior smiled. "Du-seen rose not so long</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago," he said, "that I do not recall him well, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">recently he has taken it upon himself to abrogate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ancient laws of Caspak; he has had intercourse</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Kro-lu. Du-seen would be chief of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galus, and he has come to the Kro-lu for help."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ajor was aghast. The thing was incredible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Never had Kro-lu and Galu had friendly relations;</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the savage laws of Caspak they were deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies, for only so can the several races maintain</seg><seg type="columnLine">their individuality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will the Kro-lu join him?" asked Ajor. "Will</seg><seg type="columnLine">they invade the country of Jor, my father?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The younger Kro-lu favor the plan," replied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warrior, "since they believe they will thus become</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galus immediately. They hope to span the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of change through which they must pass in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ordinary course of events and at a single stride</seg><seg type="columnLine">become Galus. We of the older Kro-lu tell them</seg><seg type="columnLine">that though they occupy the land of the Galu and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wear the skins and ornaments of the golden people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still they will not be Galus till the time arrives</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they are ripe to rise. We also tell them that</seg><seg type="columnLine">even then they will never become a true Galu race,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since there will still be those among them who can</seg><seg type="columnLine">never rise. It is all right to raid the Galu country</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasionally for plunder, as our people do; but to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt to conquer it and hold it is madness. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">my part, I have been content to wait until the call</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to me. I feel that it cannot now be long."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What is your name?" asked Ajor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Chal-az," replied the man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are chief of the Kro-lu?" Ajor continued.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No, it is Al-tan who is chief of the Kro-lu of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the east," answered Chal-az.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And he is against this plan to invade my</seg><seg type="columnLine">father's country?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Unfortunately he is rather in favor of it," re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">plied the man, "since he has about come to the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusion that he is batu. He has been chief ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">since before I came up from the Band-lu, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can see no change in him in all those years. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, he still appears to be more Band-lu than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kro-lu. However, he is a good chief and a mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">warrior, and if Du-seen persuades him to his cause,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Galus may find themselves under a Kro-lu</seg><seg type="columnLine">chieftain before long--Du-seen as well as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, for Al-tan would never consent to occupy</seg><seg type="columnLine">a subordinate position, and once he plants a vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torious foot in Galu, he will not withdraw it with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a struggle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I asked them what batu meant, as I had not be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore heard the word. Literally translated, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">equivalent to through, finished, done-for, as applied</seg><seg type="columnLine">to an individual's evolutionary progress in Caspak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with this information was developed the inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esting fact that not every individual is capable of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising through every stage to that of Galu. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">never progress beyond the Alu stage, others stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Bo-lu, as Sto-lu, as Band-lu or as Kro-lu. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ho-Iu of the first generation may rise to become</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alus; the Alus of the second generation may become</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bo-lu, while it requires three generations of Bo-lu</seg><seg type="columnLine">to become Band-lu, and so on until the Kro-lu's</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent on one side must be of the sixth generation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not entirely plain to me even with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation, since I couldn't understand how there</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be different generations of peoples who ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently had no offspring. Yet I was commencing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get a slight glimmer of the strange laws which</seg><seg type="columnLine">govern propagation and evolution in this weird</seg><seg type="columnLine">land. Already I knew that the warm pools which</seg><seg type="columnLine">always lie close to every tribal abiding-place were</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely linked with the Caspakian scheme of evolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and that the daily immersion of the females</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the greenish slimy water was in response to</seg><seg type="columnLine">some natural law, since neither pleasure nor clean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liness could be derived from what seemed almost a</seg><seg type="columnLine">religious rite. Yet I was still at sea, and seemingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ajor could not enlighten me, since she was compelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use words which I could not understand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it was impossible for her to explain the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meanings of.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"She Is Mine!" A Competition</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS we stood talking, we were suddenly startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a commotion in the bushes and among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boles of the trees surrounding us, and simultane-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously a hundred Kro-lu warriors appeared in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough circle about us. They greeted Chal-az with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a volley of questions as they approached slowly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">all sides, their heavy bows fitted with long, sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows. Upon Ajor and me they looked with covet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ousness in the one instance and suspicion in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other; but after they had heard Chal-az's story,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their attitude was more friendly. A huge savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">did all the talking. He was a mountain of a man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet perfectly proportioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is Al-tan the chief," said Chal-az by way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of introduction. Then he told something of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">story, and Al-tan asked me many questions of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land from which I came. The warriors crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">around close to hear my replies, and there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">many expressions of incredulity as I spoke of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to them another world, of the yacht which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1169</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">brought me over vast waters, and of the plane that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had borne me Jo-oo-like over the summit of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrier-cliffs. It was the mention of the hydro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aeroplane which precipitated the first outspoken</seg><seg type="columnLine">skepticism, and then Ajor came to my defense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I saw it with my own eyes!" she exclaimed. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw him flying through the air in battle with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jo-oo. The Alus were chasing me, and they saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ran away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whose is this she?" demanded Al-tan suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes fixed fiercely upon Ajor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment there was silence. Ajor looked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me, a hurt and questioning expression on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. "Whose she is this?" repeated Al-tan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She is mine," I replied, though what force it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that impelled me to say it I could not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">told; but an instant later I was glad that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken the words, for the reward of Ajor's proud</seg><seg type="columnLine">and happy face was reward indeed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Al-tan eyed her for several minutes and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to me. "Can you keep her?" he asked, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tinge of a sneer upon his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I laid my palm upon the grip of my pistol and</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered that I could. He saw the move, glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the butt of the automatic where it protruded</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its holster, and smiled. Then he turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">raising his great bow, fitted an arrow and drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shaft far back. His warriors, supercilious</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiles upon their faces, stood silently watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. His bow was the longest and the heaviest</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them all. A mighty man indeed must he be</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bend it; yet Al-tan drew the shaft back until stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">point touched his left forefinger, and he did it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">consummate ease. Then he raised the shaft to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">level of his right eye, held it there for an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">and released it. When the arrow stopped, half its</seg><seg type="columnLine">length pi'otruded from the opposite side of a six-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch tree fifty feet way. Al-tan and his warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned toward me with expressions of immense sat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isfaction upon their faces, and then, apparently for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ajor's benefit, the chieftain swaggered to and fro</seg><seg type="columnLine">a couple of times, swinging his great arms and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulky shoulders for all the world like a drunken</seg><seg type="columnLine">prize-fighter at a beach dance-hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw that some reply was necessary, and so in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a single motion, I drew my gun, dropped it on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">still quivering arrow and pulled the trigger. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound of the report, the Kro-lu leaped back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised their weapons; but as I was smiling, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">took heart and lowered them again, following my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes to the tree; the shaft of their chief was gone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and through the bole was a little round hole mark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the path of my bullet. It was a good shot if</seg><seg type="columnLine">I do say it myself, "as shouldn't;" but necessity</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have guided that bullet; I simply had to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a&gt; good shot, that I might immediately establish my</seg><seg type="columnLine">position among those savage and warlike Caspakians</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sixth sphere. That it had its effect was im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately noticeable, but I am none too sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it helped my cause with Al-tan. Whereas he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have condescended to tolerate me as a harmless and</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting curiosity, he now, by the change in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression, appeared to consider me in a new and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfavorable light. Nor can I wonder, knowing this</seg><seg type="columnLine">type as I did, for had I not made him ridiculous in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eyes of his warriors, beating him at his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">game? What king, savage or civilized, could con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">done such impudence? Seeing his black scowls, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">deemed it expedient, especially on Ajor's account, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">terminate the interview and continue upon our way;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but when I would have done so, Al-tan detained us</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a gesture, and his warriors pressed around us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Duel with a Saber-tooth Tiger</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cctttHAT is the meaning of this?" I demanded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">VV and before Al-tan could reply, Chal-az</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised his voice in our behalf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is this the gratitude of a Kro-lu chieftain, Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tan," he asked, "to one who has served you by sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing one of your warriors from the enemy--saving</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from the death dance of the Band-lu?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Al-tan was silent for a moment, and then his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brow cleared, and the faint imitation of a pleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression struggled for existence as he said:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The stranger will not be harmed. I wished only</seg><seg type="columnLine">to detain him that he may be feasted tonight in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the village of Al-tan the Kro-lu. In the morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">he may go his way. Al-tan will not hinder him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was not entirely reassured; but I wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the interior of the Kro-lu village, and anyway</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew that if Al-tan intended treachery I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be no more in his power in the morning than I now</seg><seg type="columnLine">was--in fact, during the night I might find oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity to escape with Ajor, while at the instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither of us could hope to escape unscathed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the encircling warriors. Therefore, in order to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm him of any thought that I might entertain</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicion as to his sincerity, I promptly and cour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teously accepted his invitation. His satisfaction</seg><seg type="columnLine">was evident, and as we set off toward his village,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he walked beside me, asking many questions as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country from which I came, its peoples and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their customs. He seemed much mystified by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that we could walk abroad by day or night</seg><seg type="columnLine">without fear of being devoured by wild beasts or</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage reptiles, and when I told him of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">armies which we maintained, his simple mind could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not grasp the fact that they existed solely for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaughtering of human beings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am glad," he said, "that I do not dwell in</seg><seg type="columnLine">your country among such savage peoples. Here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Caspak, men fight with men when they meet--</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of different races--but their weapons are first</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the slaying of beasts in the chase and in de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fense. We do not fashion weapons solely for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">killing of man as do your peoples. Your country</seg><seg type="columnLine">must indeed be a savage country, from which you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are fortunate to have escaped to the peace and</seg><seg type="columnLine">security of Caspak."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here was a new and refreshing viewpoint; nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">could I take exception to it after what I had told</seg><seg type="columnLine">Al-tan of the great war which had been raging in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europe for over two years before I left home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the march to the Kro-lu village we were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinually stalked by innumerable beasts of prey, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">three times we were attacked by frightful crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures; but Al-tan took it all as a matter of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing forward with raised spear or sending a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy shaft into the body of the attacker and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">returning to our conversation as though no inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruption had occurred. Twice were members of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">band mauled, and one was killed by a huge and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellicose rhinoceros; but the instant the action was</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, it was as though it never had occurred. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead man was stripped of his belongings and left</seg><seg type="columnLine">1170</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had died; the carnivora would take care</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his burial. The trophies that these Kro-lu left</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the meat-eaters would have turned an English</seg><seg type="columnLine">big-game hunter green with envy. They did, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">true, cut all the edible parts from the rhino and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry them home; but already they were pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">well weighted down with the spoils of the chase, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the fact that they are particularly fond of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhino-meat caused them to do so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They left the hide on the pieces they selected, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they use it for sandals, shield-covers, the hilts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their knives and various other purposes where</seg><seg type="columnLine">tough hide is desirable. I was much interested in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their shields, especially after I saw one used in</seg><seg type="columnLine">defense against the attack of a saber-tooth tiger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The huge creature had charged us without warning</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a clump of dense bushes where it was lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">up after eating. It was met with an avalanche of</seg><seg type="columnLine">spears, some of which passed entirely through its</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, with such force were they hurled. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge was from a very short distance, requiring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the use of the spear rather than the bow and arrow;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but after the launching of the spears, the men not</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly in the path of the charge sent bolt after</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolt into the great carcass with almost incredible</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidity. The beast, screaming with pain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage, bore down upon Chal-az while I stood helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my rifle for fear of hitting one of the war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors who were closing in upon it. But Chal-az was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready. Throwing aside his bow, he crouched be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind his large oval shield, in the center of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a hole about six inches in diameter. The shield</seg><seg type="columnLine">was held by tight loops to his left arm, while in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right hand he grasped his heavy knife.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bristling with spears and arrows, the great cat</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled itself upon the shield, and down went Chal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">az upon his back with the shield entirely covering</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The tiger clawed and bit at the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhinoceros hide with which the shield was faced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Chal-az, through the round hole in the shield's</seg><seg type="columnLine">center, plunged his blade repeatedly into the vitals</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the savage animal. Doubtless the battle would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gone to Chal-az even though I had not inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered; but the moment that I saw a clean opening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with no Kro-lu beyond, I raised my rifle and killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Caspak Village</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN Chal-az arose, he glanced at the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">and remarked that it looked like rain. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">others already had resumed the march toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">village. The incident was closed. For some unac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countable reason the whole thing reminded me of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a friend of mine who once shot a cat in his back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard. For three weeks he talked of nothing else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was almost dark when we reached the village--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large palisaded inclosure of several hundred leaf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thatched huts set in groups of from two to seven.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The huts were hexagonal in form, and where</seg><seg type="columnLine">grouped were joined so that they resembled the cells</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a beehive. One hut meant a warrior and his mate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and each additional hut in a group indicated an</seg><seg type="columnLine">additional female. The palisade which surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the village was of logs set close together and woven</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a solid wall with tough creepers which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">planted at their base and trained to weave in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to bind the logs together. The logs slanted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">outward at an angle of about thirty degrees, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which position they were held by shorter logs em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bedded in the ground at right angles to them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their upper ends supporting the longer pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trifle above their centers of equilibrium. Along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of the palisade sharpened stakes had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven at all sorts of angles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The only opening into the inclosure was through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small aperture three feet wide and three feet high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was closed from the inside by logs about six</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet long laid horizontally, one upon another, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the inside face of the palisade and two other</seg><seg type="columnLine">braced logs which paralleled the face of the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the inside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we entered the village, we were greeted by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">not unfriendly crowd of curious warriors and</seg><seg type="columnLine">women, to whom Chal-az generously explained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">service we had rendered him, whereupon they</seg><seg type="columnLine">showered us with the most well-meant attentions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Chal-az, it seemed, was a most popular member</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tribe. Neckl'aces of lion- and tiger-teeth, bits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dried meat, finely tanned hides and earthen pots,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautifully decorated, they thrust upon us until we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were loaded down, and all the while Al-tan glared</seg><seg type="columnLine">balefully upon us, seemingly jealous of the atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions heaped upon us because we had served</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chal-az.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last we reached a hut that they set apart for</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, and there we cooked our meat and some vege-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tables the women brought us, and had milk from</seg><seg type="columnLine">cows--the first I had had in Caspak--and cheese</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the milk of wild goats, with honey and thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">bread made from wheat flour of their own grinding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and grapes and the fermented juice of grapes. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quite the most wonderful meal I had eaten since</seg><seg type="columnLine">I quit the Toreador and Bowen J. Tyler's colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">chef, who could make pork-chops taste like chicken,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chicken taste like heaven.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER dinner I rolled a cigaret and stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself at ease upon a pile of furs before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doorway, with Ajor's head pillowed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my lap and a feeling of great content pervading</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. It was the first time since my plane had topped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barrier-cliffs of Caspak that I had felt any sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of peace or security. My hand wandered to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">velvet cheek of the girl I had claimed as mine, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her luxuriant hair and the golden fillet which</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound it close to her shapely head. Her slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers groping upward sought mine and drew them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her lips, and then I gathered her in my arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crushed her to me, smothering her mouth with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long, long kiss. It was the first time that pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion had tinged my intercourse with Ajor. We were</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, and the hut was ours until morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now from beyond the palisade in the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the main gate came the hallooing of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the answering calls and queries of the guard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We listened. Returning hunters, no doubt. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard them enter the village amidst the barking</seg><seg type="columnLine">dogs. I have forgotten to mention the dogs of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kro-lu. The village swarmed with them, gaunt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wolflike creatures that guarded the herd by day</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it grazed without the palisade, ten dogs to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cow. By night the cows were herded in an outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclosure roofed against the onslaughts of the car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1171</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nivorous cats; and the dogs, with the exception of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few, were brought into the village; these few</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-tested brutes remained with the herd. During</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day they fed plentifully upon the beasts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">prey which they killed in protection of the herd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that their keep amounted to nothing at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shortly after the commotion at the gate had</seg><seg type="columnLine">subsided, Ajor and I arose to enter the hut, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same time a warrior appeared from one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the twisted alleys which, lying between the irregu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larly placed huts and groups of huts, form the</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets of the Kro-lu village. The fellow halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">before us and addressed me, saying that Al-tan de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sired my presence at his hut. The wording of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">invitation and the manner of the messenger threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">me entirely off my guard, so cordial was the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">and respectful the other, and the result was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I went willingly, telling Ajor that I would return</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently. I had laid my arms and ammunition</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside as soon as we had taken over the hut, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">left them with Ajor now, as I had noticed that aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their hunting-knives the men of Kro-lu bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">no weapons about the village streets. There was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere of peace and security within that village</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had not hoped to experience within Caspak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after what I had passed through, it must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast a numbing spell over my faculties of judgment</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reason. I had eaten of the lotus-flower of</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety; dangers no longer threatened for they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased to be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The messenger led me through the labyrinthine</seg><seg type="columnLine">alleys to an open plaza near the center of the vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lage. At one end of this plaza was a long hut,</seg><seg type="columnLine">much the largest that I had yet seen, before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door of which were many warriors. I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the interior was lighted and that a great num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of men were gathered within. The dogs about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plaza were as thick as fleas, and those I ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached closely evinced a strong desire to devour</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, their noses evidently apprising them of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that I was of an alien race, since they paid no</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention whatever to my companion. Once inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the council-hut, for such it appeared to be, I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large concourse of warriors seated, or rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">squatted, around the floor. At one end of the oval</seg><seg type="columnLine">space which the warriors left down the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room stood Al-tan and another warrior whom I</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately recognized as a Galu, and then I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there were many Galus present. About the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls were a number of flaming torches stuck in</seg><seg type="columnLine">holes in a clay plaster which evidently served the</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose of preventing the inflammable wood and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasses of which the hut was composed from being</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignited by the flames. Lying about among the war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors or wandering restlessly to and fro were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of savage dogs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The warriors eyed me curiously as I entered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially the Galus, and then I was conducted into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the group and led forward toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Al-tan. As I advanced, I felt one of the dogs sniff-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at my heels, and of a sudden a great brute</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped upon my back. As I turned to thrust it</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside before its fangs found a hold upon me, I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">held a huge Airedale leaping frantically about me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The grinning jaws, the half-closed eyes, the back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid ears spoke to me louder than might the words</seg><seg type="columnLine">of man that here was no savage enemy but a joy-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ous friend, and then I recognized him, and fell to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one knee and put my arms about his neck while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">whined and cried with joy. It was Nobs, dear old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nobs, Bowen Tyler's Nobs, who had loved me next</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his master.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is the master of this dog?" I asked, turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing toward Al-tan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chieftain inclined his head toward the Galu</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing at his side. "He belongs to Du-seen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galu," he replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He belongs to Bowen J. Tyler, Jr., of Santa</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monica," I retorted, "and I want to know where his</seg><seg type="columnLine">master is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Galu shrugged. "The dog is mine," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He came to me cor-sva-jo, and he is unlike any</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog in Caspak, being kind and docile and yet a killer</seg><seg type="columnLine">when aroused. I would not part with him. I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know the man of whom you speak."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So this was Du-seen! This was the man from</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom Ajor had fled. I wondered if he knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was here. I wondered if they had sent for me</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of her; but after they had commenced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">question me, my mind was relieved; they did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">mention Ajor. Their interest seemed centered upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange world from which I had come, my jour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney to Caspak and my intentions now that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived. I answered them frankly as I had nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to conceal and assured them that my only wish was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find my friends and return to my own country.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the Galu Du-seen and his warriors I saw some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of the explanation of the term "golden race"</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is applied to them, for their ornaments and</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons were either wholly of beaten gold or heav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily decorated with the precious metal. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very imposing set of men--tall and straight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">handsome. About their heads were bands of gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that which Ajor wore, and from their left</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders depended the leopard-tails of the Galus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In addition to the deer-skin tunic which constituted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the major portion of their apparel, each carried a</seg><seg type="columnLine">light blanket of barbaric yet beautiful design--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first evidence of weaving I had seen in Caspak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ajor had had no blanket, having lost it during her</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight from the attentions of Du-seen; nor was she</seg><seg type="columnLine">so heavily incrusted with gold as these male mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers of her tribe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The audience must have lasted fully an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Al-tan signified that I might return to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut. All the time Nobs had lain quietly at my feet;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the instant that I turned to leave, he was up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after me. Du-seen called to him; but the ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rier never even so much as looked in his direction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had almost reached the doorway leading from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">council-hall when Al-tan rose and called after me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Stop!" he shouted. "Stop, stranger! The beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Du-seen the Galu follows you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The dog is not Du-seen's," I replied. "He be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">longs to my friends, as I told you, and he prefers to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay with me until his master is found." And I</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned again to resume my way. I had taken but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few steps when I heard a commotion behind me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same moment a man leaned close and whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered "Kazar!" close to my ear--kazar, the Cas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pakian equivalent of beware. It was To-mar. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">he spoke, he turned quickly away as though loath</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have others see that he knew me, and at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same instant I wheeled to discover Du-seen striding</seg><seg type="columnLine">1172</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly after me. Al-tan followed him, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident that both were angry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Du-seen, a weapon half drawn, approached trucu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lently. "The beast is mine," he reiterated. "Would</seg><seg type="columnLine">you steal him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is not yours nor mine," I replied, "and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am not stealing him. If he wishes to follow you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he may; I will not interfere; but if he wishes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow me, he shall; nor shall you prevent." I</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to Al-tan. "Is not that fair?" I demanded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let the dog choose his master."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Nobs to the Rescue</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DU-SEEN, without waiting for Al-tan's reply,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached for Nobs and grasped him by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scruff of the neck. I did not interfere, for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed what would happen; and it did. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage growl Nobs turned like lightning upon, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galu, wrenched loose from his hold and leaped for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his throat. The man stepped back and warded off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first attack with a heavy blow of his fist, imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately drawing his knife with which to meet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Airedale's return. And Nobs would have returned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right, had I not spoken to him. In a low voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">I called him to heel. For just an instant he hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated, standing there trembling and with bared</seg><seg type="columnLine">fangs, glaring at his foe; but he was well trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had been out with me quite as much as he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Bowen--in fact, I had had most to do with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his early training; then he walked slowly and very</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff-legged to his place behind me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Du-seen, red with rage, would have had it out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the two of us had not Al-tan drawn him to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side and whispered in his ear--upon which, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunt, the Galu walked straight back to the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the hall, while Nobs and I continued upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">our way toward the hut and Ajor. As we passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into the village plaza, I saw Chal-az--we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">so close to one another that I could have reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and touched him--and our eyes met; but though</seg><seg type="columnLine">I greeted him pleasantly and paused to speak to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he brushed past me without a sign of recogni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. I was puzzled at his behavior, and then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">recalled that To-mar, though he had warned me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had appeared not to wish to seem friendly with me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not understand their attitude, and was try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to puzzle out some sort of explanation, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter was suddenly driven from my mind by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the report of a firearm. Instantly I broke into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">run, my brain in a whirl of forebodings, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">culy firearms in the Kro-lu country were those I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had left in the hut with Ajor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That she was in danger I could not but fear, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">;he was now something of an adept in the handling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of both the pistol and rifle, a fact which largely</seg><seg type="columnLine">eliminated the chance that the shot had come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">an accidentally discharged firearm. When I left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hut, I had felt that she and I were safe among</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends; no thought of danger was in my mind; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">since my audience with Al-tan, the presence and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing of Du-seen and the strange attitude of both</seg><seg type="columnLine">To-mar and Chal-az had each contributed toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">arousing my suspicions, and now I ran along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow, winding alleys of the Kro-lu village with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my heart fairly in my mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I am endowed with an excellent sense of direction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which has been greatly perfected by the years I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have spent in the mountains and upon the plains</seg><seg type="columnLine">and deserts of my native state, so that it was with</seg><seg type="columnLine">little or no difficulty that I found my way back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hut in which I had left Ajor. As I entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway, I called her name aloud. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">response. I drew a box of matches from my pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">and struck a light, and as the flame flared up, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-dozen brawny warriors leaped upon me from</seg><seg type="columnLine">as many directions; but even in the brief instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the flare lasted, I saw that Ajor was not within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hut, and that my arms and ammunition had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been removed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the six men leaped upon me, an angry growl</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst from behind them. I had forgotten Nobs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like a demon of hate he sprang among those Kro-lu</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting men, tearing, rending, ripping with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">long tusks and his mighty jaws. They had me</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in an instant, and it goes without saying that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the six of them could have kept me there had it not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been for Nobs; but while I was struggling to throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">them off, Nobs was springing first upon one and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then upon another of them until they were so put</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it to preserve their hides and their lives from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that they could give me only a small part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their attention. One of them was assiduously at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempting to strike me on the head with his stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatchet; but I caught his arm and at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time turned over upon my belly, after which it took</seg><seg type="columnLine">but an instant to get my feet under me and rise</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I did so, I kept a grip upon the man's arm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying it over one shoulder. Then I leaned sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly forward and hurled my antagonist over my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head to a nasty fall at the opposite side of the hut.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the dim light of the interior I saw that Nobs</seg><seg type="columnLine">had already accounted for one of the others--one</seg><seg type="columnLine">who lay very quiet upon the floor--while the four</seg><seg type="columnLine">remaining upon their feet were striking at him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">knives and hatchets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Running to the side of the man I had just put</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the fighting, I seized his hatchet and knife,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in another moment was in the thick of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">argument. I was no match for these savage war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors with their own weapons and would soon have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone down to ignominious defeat and death had</seg><seg type="columnLine">it not been for Nobs, who alone was a match for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the four of them. I never saw any creature so quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon its feet as was that great Airedale, nor such</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightful ferocity as he manifested in his attacks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was as much the latter as the former which con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tributed to the undoing of our enemies, who, accus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomed though they were to the ferocity of terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures, seemed awed by the sight of this strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast from another world battling at the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his equally strange master. Yet they were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowards, and only by teamwork did Nobs and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcome them at last. We would rush for a man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">simultaneously and as Nobs leaped for him upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side, I would strike at his head with the stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatchet from the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the last man went down, I heard the running</seg><seg type="columnLine">of many feet approaching us from the direction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plaza. To be captured now would mean death;</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet I could not attempt to leave the village without</seg><seg type="columnLine">first ascertaining the whereabouts of Ajor and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leasing her if she were held a captive. That I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape the village I was not at all sure; but of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1173</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thing I was positive; that it would do neither Ajor</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor myself any service to remain where I was and</seg><seg type="columnLine">be captured; so with Nobs, bloody and happy, fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing at heel, I turned down the first alley and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slunk away in the direction of the northern end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the village.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Friendless and alone, hunted through the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">labyrinths of this savage community, I seldom have</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt more helpless than at that moment; yet far</seg><seg type="columnLine">transcending any fear which I may have felt for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own safety was my concern for that of Ajor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What fate had befallen her? Where was she, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in whose power? That I should live to learn the</seg><seg type="columnLine">answers to these queries I doubted; but that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should face death gladly in the attempt--of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was certain. And why? With all my concern for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the welfare of my friends who had accompanied me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Caprona, and of my best friend of all, Bowen J.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tyler, Jr., I never yet had experienced the almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralyzing fear for the safety of any other crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture which now threw me alternately into a fever</seg><seg type="columnLine">of despair and into a cold sweat of apprehension</seg><seg type="columnLine">as my mind dwelt upon the fate of one bit of half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage femininity of whose very existence I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even dreamed a few short weeks before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What was this hold she had upon me? Was I</seg><seg type="columnLine">bewitched, that my mind refused to function</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanely, and that judgment and reason were de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">throned by some mad sentiment which I steadfastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">refused to believe was love? I had never been in</seg><seg type="columnLine">love. I was not in love now--the very thought was</seg><seg type="columnLine">preposterous. How could I, Thomas Billings, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right-hand man of the late Bowen J. Tyler, Sr., one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of America's foremost captains of industry and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest man in California, be in love with a--a--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the word stuck in my throat; yet by my own Amer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ican standards Ajor could be nothing else; at home,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all her beauty, for all her delicately tinted skin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">little Ajor by her apparel, by the habits and cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toms and manners of her people, by her life, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been classed as a squaw. Tom Billings in love</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a squaw! I shuddered at the thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then there came to my mind, in a sudden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant flash upon the screen of recollection the</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture of Ajor as I had last seen her, and I lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">again the delicious moment in which we had clung</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one another, lips smothering lips, as I left her</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go to the council hall of Al-tan; and I could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked myself for the snob and the cad that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts had proven me--me, who had always</seg><seg type="columnLine">prided myself that I was neither the one nor the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These things ran through my mind as Nobs and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">made our way through the dark village, the voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">and footsteps of those who sought us still in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears. These and many other things. I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape the incontrovertible fact that the little fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure round which my recollections and my hopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">entwined themselves was that of Ajor--beloved</seg><seg type="columnLine">barbarian! My reveries were broken in upon by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarse whisper from the black interior of a hut past</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we were making our way. My name was</seg><seg type="columnLine">called in a low voice, and a man stepped out beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">me as I halted with raised knife. It was Chal-az.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick!" he warned. "In here! It is my hut,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they will not search it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I hesitated, recalling his attitude of a few min-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">utes before; and as though he had read my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts, he said quickly: "I could not speak to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you in the plaza without danger of arousing sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picions which would prevent me aiding you later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for word had gone out that Al-tan had turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">against you and would destroy you--this was after</seg><seg type="columnLine">Du-seen the Galu arrived."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ajor, the Beautiful Caspakian, Safe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I FOLLOWED him into the hut, and with Nobs</seg><seg type="columnLine">at our heels we passed through several chambers</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a remote and windowless apartment where a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small lamp sputtered in its unequal battle with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inky darkness. A hole in the roof permitted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke from the burning oil egress; yet the atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere was far from lucid. Here Chal-az motioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to a seat upon a furry hide spread upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthen floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am your friend," he said. "You saved my</seg><seg type="columnLine">life; and I am no ingrate as is the batu Al-tan. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will serve you, and there are others here who will</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve you against Al-tan and this renegade Galu,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Du-seen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But where is Ajor?" I asked, for I cared little</seg><seg type="columnLine">for my own safety while she was in danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ajor is safe, too," he answered. "We learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the designs of Al-tan and Du-seen. The latter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">learning that Ajor was here, demanded her; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Al-tan promised that he should have her; but when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warriors went to get her, To-mar went with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Ajor tried to defend herself. She killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the warriors, and then To-mar picked her up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his arms when the others had taken her weapons</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her. He told the others to look after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded man, who was really already dead, and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">seize you upon your return, and that he, To-mar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would bear Ajor to Al-tan; but instead of bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to Al-tan, he took her to his own hut, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">she now is with So-al, To-mar's she. It all hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened very quickly. To-mar and I were in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">council-hut when Du-seen attempted to take the dog</seg><seg type="columnLine">from you. I was seeking To-mar for this work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He ran out immediately and accompanied the war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors to your hut while I remained to watch what</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on within the council-hut and to aid you if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed aid. What has happened since you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thanked him for his loyalty and then asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to take me to Ajor; but he said that it could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be done, as the village streets were filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">searchers. In fact, we could hear them passing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fro among the huts, making inquiries, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last Chal-az thought it best to go to the doorway</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his dwelling, which consisted of many huts joined</seg><seg type="columnLine">together, lest they enter and search.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chal-az was absent for a long time--several</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours which seemed an eternity to me. All sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pursuit had long since ceased, and I was becom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing uneasy because of his protracted absence when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard him returning through the other apartments</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his dwelling. He was perturbed when he entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in which I awaited him, and I saw a worried</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression upon his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is wrong?" I asked. "Have they found</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ajor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he replied; "but Ajor has gone. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned that you had escaped them and was told</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you had left the village, believing that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped too. So-al could not detain her. She made</seg><seg type="columnLine">1174</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">her way out over the top of the palisade, armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">only with her knife."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then I must go," I said, rising. Nobs rose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook himself. He had been dead alseep when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," agreed Chal-az, "you must go at once. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is almost dawn. Du-seen leaves at daylight to</seg><seg type="columnLine">search for her." He leaned close to my ear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered: "There are many to follow and help</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Al-tan has agreed to aid Du-seen against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galus of Jor; but there are many of us who have</seg><seg type="columnLine">combined to rise against Al-tan and prevent this</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruthless desecration of the laws and customs of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kro-lu and of Caspak. We will rise as Luata has</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordained that we shall rise, and only thus. No batu</seg><seg type="columnLine">may win the estate of a Galu by treachery and force</seg><seg type="columnLine">of arms while Chal-az lives and can wield a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow and a sharp spear with true Kro-lus at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope that I may live to aid you," I replied. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had my weapons and my ammunition, I could do</seg><seg type="columnLine">much. Do you know where they are?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he said, "they have disappeared." And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then: "Wait! You cannot go forth half armed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and garbed as you are. You are going into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galu country, and you must go as a Galu. Come!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">And without waiting for a reply, he led me into</seg><seg type="columnLine">another apartment, or to be more explicit, another</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the several huts which formed his cellular</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwelling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here was a pile of skins, weapons and ornaments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Remove your strange apparel," said Chal-az, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will fit you out as a true Galu. I have slain sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral of them in the raids of my early days as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kro-lu, and here are their trappings."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dressing and Arming in Caspakian Style</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I SAW the wisdom of his suggestion, and as my</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes were by now so ragged as to but half</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceal my nakedness, I had no regrets in laying</seg><seg type="columnLine">them aside. Stripped to the skin, I donned the red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deer-skin tunic, the leopard-tail, the golden fillet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">armlets and Ieg-ornaments of a Galu, with the belt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scabbard and knife, the shield, spear, bow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrow and the long rope which I learned now for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time is the distinctive weapon of the Galu</seg><seg type="columnLine">warrior. It is a rawhide rope, not dissimilar to</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of the Western plains and cow-camps of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth. The honda is a golden oval about which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">braided the rawhide, making a heavy and accurate</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight for the throwing of the noose. This heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">honda, Chal-az explained, is used as a weapon, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing thrown with great force and accuracy at an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy and then coiled in for another cast. In hunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and in battle, they use both the noose and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">honda. If several warriors surround a single foe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man or quarry, they rope it with the noose from</seg><seg type="columnLine">several sides; but a single warrior against a lone</seg><seg type="columnLine">antagonist will attempt to brain his foe with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal oval.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could not have been more pleased with any</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon, short of a rifle, which he could have found</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me, since I have been adept with the rope from</seg><seg type="columnLine">early childhood; but I must confess that I was less</seg><seg type="columnLine">favorably inclined toward my apparel. In so far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the sensation was concerned, I might as well have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been entirely naked, so short and light was the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tunic. When I asked Chal-az for the Caspakian</seg><seg type="columnLine">name for rope, he told me ga, and for the first time</seg><seg type="columnLine">I understood the derivation of the word Galu, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">means ropeman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Entirely outfitted I would not have known my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, so strange was my garb and my armament.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Upon my back were slung my bow, arrows, shield,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and short spear; from the center of my girdle de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended my knife; at my right hip was my stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatchet; and at my left hung the coils of my long</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope. By reaching my right hand over my left</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, I could seize the spear or arrows; my</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hand could find my bow over my right shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while a veritable contortionist-act was necessary to</seg><seg type="columnLine">place my shield in front of me and upon my left</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm. The shield, long and oval, is utilized more as</seg><seg type="columnLine">back-armor than as a defense against frontal at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack, for the close-set armlets of gold upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left fore-arm are principally depended upon to ward</seg><seg type="columnLine">off knife, spear, hatchet, or arrow from in front;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but against the greater carnivora and the attacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of several human antagonists, the shield is utilized</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its best advantage and carried by loops upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fully equipped, except for a blanket, I followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chal-az from his domicile into the dark and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted alleys of Kro-lu. Silently we crept along,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nobs silent at heel, toward the nearest portion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the palisade. Here Chal-az bade me farewell, tell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me that he hoped to see me soon among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galus, as he felt that "the call soon would come"</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. I thanked him for his loyal assistance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised that whether I reached the Galu country</seg><seg type="columnLine">or not, I should always stand ready to repay his</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindness to me, and that he could count on me in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the revolution against Al-tan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TO RUN up the inclined surface of the pali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sade and drop to the ground outside was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work of but a moment, or would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">but for Nobs. I had to put my rope about him</seg><seg type="columnLine">after we reached the top, lift him over the sharp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened stakes and lower him upon the outside. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">find Ajor in the unknown country to the north</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed rather hopeless; yet I could do no less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">try, praying in the meanwhile that she would come</seg><seg type="columnLine">through unscathed and in safety to her father.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Nobs and I swung along in the growing light</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the coming day, I was impressed by the lessen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing numbers of savage beasts the farther north I</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled. With the decrease among the carnivora,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the herbivora increased in quantity, though any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where in Caspak they are sufficiently plentiful to</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnish ample food for the meat-eaters of each</seg><seg type="columnLine">locality. The wild cattle, antelope, deer, and horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">I passed showed changes in evolution from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cousins farther south. The kine were smaller and</seg><seg type="columnLine">less shaggy, the horses larger. North of the Kro-lu</seg><seg type="columnLine">village I saw a small band of the latter of about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the size of those of our old Western plains--such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Indians bred in former days and to a lesser</seg><seg type="columnLine">extent even now. They were fat and sleek, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked upon them with covetous eyes and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts that any old cow-puncher may well imag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ine I might entertain after having hoofed it for</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks; but they were wary, scarce permitting me</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1175</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to approach within bow-and-arrow range, much less</seg><seg type="columnLine">within roping-distance; yet I still had hopes which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I never discarded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twice before noon we were stalked and charged</seg><seg type="columnLine">by man-eaters; but even though I was without fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms, I still had ample protection in Nobs, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently had learned something of Caspakian hunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">rules under the tutorage of Du-seen or some other</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galu, and of course a great deal more by experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence. He always was on the alert for dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">foes, invariably warning me by low growls of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">approach of a large carnivorous animal long before</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could either see or hear it, and then when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing appeared, he would run snapping at his heels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing the charge away from me until I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety in some tree; yet never did the wily Nobs</seg><seg type="columnLine">take an unnecessary chance of mauling. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">dart in and away so quickly that not even the light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning-like movements of the great cats could reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. I have seen him tantalize them thus until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they fairly screamed in rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The greatest inconvenience the man-eaters caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the delay, for they have a nasty habit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping one treed for an hour or more if balked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their designs; but at last we came in sight of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of cliffs running east and west across our path</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far as the eye could see in either direction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I knew that we had reached the natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">boundary which marks the line between the Kro-lu</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Galu countries. The southern face of these cliffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">loomed high and forbidding, rising to an altitude of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some two hundred feet, sheer and precipitous, with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a break that the eye could perceive. How I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to find a crossing I could not guess. Whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">to search to the east toward the still loftier barrier-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs fronting upon the ocean, or westward in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of the inland sea was a question which</seg><seg type="columnLine">baffled me. Were there many passes or only one?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had no way of knowing. I could but trust to</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance. It never occurred to me that Nobs had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the crossing at least once, possibly a greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of times, and that he might lead me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pass; and so it was with no idea of assistance</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I appealed to him as a man alone with a dumb</seg><seg type="columnLine">brute so often does.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nobs," I said, "how the devil are we going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross those cliffs?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I do not say that he understood me, even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">I realize that an Airedale is a mighty intelligent</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog; but I do swear that he seemed to understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, for he wheeled about, barking joyously, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trotted off toward the west; and when I didn't fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low him, he ran back to me, barking furiously, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last taking hold of the calf of my leg in an effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pull me along in the direction he wished me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go. Now, as my legs were naked and Nobs' jaws</seg><seg type="columnLine">are much more powerful than he realizes, I gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">in and followed him, for I knew that I might as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well go west as east, as far as any knowledge I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the correct direction went.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We followed the base of the cliffs for a consider-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able distance. The ground was rolling and tree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dotted and covered with grazing animals, alone, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">pairs and in herds--a motley aggregation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">modern and extinct herbivora of the world. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge woolly mastodon stood swaying to and fro in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shade of a giant fern--a mighty bull with enor-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mous upcurving tusks. Near him grazed an</seg><seg type="columnLine">aurochs bull with a cow and calf, close beside a lone</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhinoceros asleep in a dust-hole. Deer, antelope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bison, horses, sheep, and goats were all in sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same time, and at a little distance a giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">megatherium reared up on its huge tail and massive</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind feet to tear the leaves from a tall tree. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten past rubbed flanks with the present--</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Tom Billings, modern of the moderns, passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the garb of a pre-Glacial man, and before him</seg><seg type="columnLine">trotted a creature of a breed scarce sixty years</seg><seg type="columnLine">old. Nobs was a parvenu; but it failed to worry</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we neared the inland sea we saw more flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">reptiles and several great amphibians, but none of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them attacked us. In the middle of the afternoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we were topping a rise, I saw something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought me to a sudden stop. Calling Nobs in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper, I cautioned him to silence and kept him</seg><seg type="columnLine">at heel while I threw myself flat and watched, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind a sheltering shrub, a body of warriors ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching the cliff from the south. I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were Galus, and I guessed that Du-seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">led them. They had taken a shorter route to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass and so had overhauled me. I could see them</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly, for they were no great distance away, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw with relief that Ajor was not with them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cliffs before them were broken and ragged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">those coming from the east overlapping the cliffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the west. Into the defile formed by this over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapping the party filed. I could see them climbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward for a few minutes, and then they disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared from view. When the last of them had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed from sight, I rose and bent my steps in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of the pass--the same pass toward which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nobs had evidently been leading me. I went warily</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I approached it, for fear the party might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted to rest. If they hadn't halted, I had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear of being discovered, for I had seen that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galus marched without point, flankers or rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard; and when I reached the pass and saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow one-man trail leading upward at a stiff</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle, I wished that I were chief of the Galus for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few weeks. A dozen men could hold off forever</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that narrow pass all the hordes which might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought up from the south; yet there it lay entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">unguarded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Galus might be a great people in Caspak;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they were pitifully inefficient in even the sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pler forms of military tactics. I was surprised that</seg><seg type="columnLine">even a man of the Stone Age should be so lacking</seg><seg type="columnLine">in military perspicacity. Du-seen dropped far be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low par in my estimation as I saw the slovenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation of his troop as it passed through an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy country and entered the domain of the chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">against whom he had risen in revolt; but Du-seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have known Jor the chief and known that Jor</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be waiting for him at the pass. Never-</seg><seg type="columnLine">theless he took unwarranted chances. With one</seg><seg type="columnLine">squad of home-guard company I could have con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quered Caspak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nobs and I followed to the summit of the pass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there we saw the party defiling into the Galu</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, the level of which was not, on an average,</seg><seg type="columnLine">over fifty feet below the summit of the cliffs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a hundred and fifty feet above the adjacent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kro-lu domain. Immediately the landscape changed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1176</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The trees, the flowers and the shrubs were of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardier type, and I realized that at night the Galu</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanket might be almost a necessity. Acacia an&lt;f</seg><seg type="columnLine">eucalyptus predominated among the trees; yet there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were ash and oak and even pine and fir and hem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock. The tree-life was riotous. The forests were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dense and filled with enormous trees. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">summit of the cliff I could see forests rising hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds of feet above the level upon which I stood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even at the distance they were from me I real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized that the boles were of gigantic size.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Good Bow-shot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT last I had come to the Galu country. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">not conceived in Caspak, I had indeed come up</seg><seg type="columnLine">eor-sva-jo--from the beginning I had come up</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the hideous horrors of the lower Caspakian</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres of evolution, and I could not but feel some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of the elation and pride w'hich had filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">To-mar and So-al when they realized that the call</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to them and they were about to rise from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the estate of Band-lus to that of Kro-lus. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad that I was not batu.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But where was Ajor? Though my eyes searched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wide landscape before me, I saw nothing other</seg><seg type="columnLine">than warriors of Du-seen and the beasts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fields and the forests. Surrounded by forests, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see wide plains dotting the country as far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eye could reach; but nowhere was a sign of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small Galu she--the beloved she whom I would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">given my right hand to see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nobs and I were hungry; we had not eaten since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the preceding night, and below us was game--deer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheep, anything that a hungry hunter might crave;</seg><seg type="columnLine">so down the steep trail we made our way, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon my belly with Nobs crouching low behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, I crawled toward a small herd of red deer feed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the edge of a plain close beside a forest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was ample cover, what with solitary trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dotting bushes, so that I found no difficulty in</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalking up wind to within fifty feet of my quarry--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large, sleek doe unaccompanied by a fawn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greatly then did I regret my rifle. Never in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">life had I shot an arrow; but I knew how it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">done, and fitting the shaft to my string, I aimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully and let drive. At the same instant I</seg><seg type="columnLine">called to Nobs and leaped to my feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The arrow caught the doe full in the side, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the same moment Nobs was after her. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to flee with the two of us pursuing her, Nobs</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his great fangs bared and I with my short</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear poised for a cast. The balance bi the herd</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang quickly away; but the hurt doe lagged, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a moment Nobs was beside her and had leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her throat. He had her down when I came up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I finished her with my spear. It didn't take</seg><seg type="columnLine">me long to have a fire going and a steak broiling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and while I was preparing for my own feast, Nobs</seg><seg type="columnLine">was filling himself with raw venison. Never have</seg><seg type="columnLine">I enjoyed a meal so heartily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For two days I searched fruitlessly back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth from the inland sea almost to the barrier</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs for some trace of Ajor, and always I trended</seg><seg type="columnLine">northward; but I saw no sign of any human be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, not even the band of Galu warriors under Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen; and then I commenced to have misgivings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had Chal-az spoken the truth to me when he said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that Ajor had quit the village of the Kro-lu?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Might he not have been acting upon the orders of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Al-tan, in whose savage bosom might have lurked</seg><seg type="columnLine">some small spark of shame that he had attempted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do to death one who had befriended a Kro-lu</seg><seg type="columnLine">warrior--a guest who had brought no harm upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kro-lu race--and thus have sent me out upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fruitless mission in the hope that the wild beasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">would do what Al-tan hesitated to do? I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know; but the more I thought upon it, the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced I became that Ajor had not quitted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kro-lu village; but if not, what had brought Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen forth without her? There was a puzzler, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">once again I was all at sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the second day of my experiences of the Galu</seg><seg type="columnLine">country I came upon a bunch of as magnificent</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses as it has ever been my lot to see. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark bays with blazed faces and perfect surcingles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of white about their barrels. Their forelegs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">white to the knees. In height they stood almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixteen hands, the mares being a trifle smaller than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stallions, of which there were three or four</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this band of a hundred, which comprised many</seg><seg type="columnLine">colts and half-grown horses. Their markings were</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost identical, indicating a purity of strain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have persisted since long ages ago. If I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">coveted one of the little ponies of the Kro-lu coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try, imagine my state of mind when I came upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">these magnificent creatures! No sooner had I</seg><seg type="columnLine">espied them than I determined to possess one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them; nor did it take me long to select a beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">young stallion--a four-year-old, I guessed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Lasso and the Horses</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE horses were grazing close to the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest in which Nobs and I were concealed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the ground between us and them was dotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with clumps of flowering brush which offered per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect concealment. The stallion of my choice grazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a filly and two yearlings a little apart from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the balance of the herd and nearest to the forest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to me. At my whispered "Charge!" Nobs flat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened himself to the ground, and I knew that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not again move until I called him, unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger threatened me from the rear. Carefully I</seg><seg type="columnLine">crept forward toward my unsuspecting quarry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming undetected to the concealment of a bush not</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than twenty feet from him. Here I quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged my noose, spreading it flat and open upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To step to one side of the bush and throw di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectly from the ground, which is the style I am best</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, would take but an instant, and in that instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stallion would doubtless be under way at top</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed in the opposite direction. Yet I felt that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could accomplish it, and especially so if the animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">would but turn for a moment in my direction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he would have to wheel about when I sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised him, and in doing so, he would most certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise sliglitly upon his hind feet and throw up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, presenting a perfect target for my noose as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he pivoted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, I had it beautifully worked out, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited until he should turn in my direction. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">last it became evident that he was doing so, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently without cause, the filly raised her head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighed and started off at a trot in the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1177</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">direction, immediately followed, of course, by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">colts and my stallion. It looked for a moment as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though my last hope was blasted; but presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fright, if fright it was, passed, and they re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed grazing again a hundred yards farther on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This time there was no bush within fifty feet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and I was at a loss as to how to get within</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe roping-distance. Anywhere under forty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am an excellent roper, at fifty feet I am fair; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">over that I knew it would be but a matter of luck</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I succeeded in getting my noose about that beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiful arched neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I stood debating the question in my mind, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was almost upon the point of making the attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the long throw. I had plenty of rope, this Galu</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon being fully sixty feet long. How I wished</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the collies from the ranch! At a word they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have circled this little bunch and driven it</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight down to me; and then it flashed into my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind that Nobs had run with those collies all one</seg><seg type="columnLine">summer, that he had gone down to the pasture with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them after the cows every evening and done his</seg><seg type="columnLine">part in driving them back to the milking-barn, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done it intelligently; but Nobs had never done</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing alone, and it had been a year since he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done it at all. However, the chances were</seg><seg type="columnLine">more in favor of my foozling the long throw than</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Nobs would fall down in his part if I gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having come to a decision, I had to creep back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Nobs and get him, and then with him at my heels</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to a large bush near the four horses. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could see directly through the bush, and point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the animals out to Nobs I whispered: "Fetch</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em, boy!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In an instant he was gone, circling wide toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear of the quarry. They caught sight of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost immediately and broke into a trot away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; but when they saw that he was apparently-</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving them a wide berth they stopped again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though they stood watching him, with high-held</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads and quivering nostrils. It was a beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight. And then Nobs turned in behind them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trotted slowly back toward me. He did not bark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or come rushing down upon them, and then when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come closer to them, he proceeded at a walk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The splendid creatures seemed more curious than</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearful, making no effort to escape until Nobs was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite close to them; then they trotted slowly away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at right angles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Nobs Driving the Horses to Capture</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND now the fun and trouble commenced. Nobs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, attempted to turn them, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have selected the stallion to work upon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he paid no attention to the others, having in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligence enough to know that a lone dog could run</seg><seg type="columnLine">his legs off before he could round up four horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">that didn't wish to be rounded up. The stallion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, had notions of his own about being</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed, and the result was as pretty a race as one</seg><seg type="columnLine">would care to see. Gad, how that horse could run!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He seemed to flatten out and shoot through the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the very minimum of exertion, and at his fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot ran Nobs, doing his best to turn him. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">barking now, and twice he leaped high against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stallfon's flank; but this cost too much effort and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">always lost him ground, as each time he was hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels over head by the impact; yet before they dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared over a rise in the ground I was sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nobs' persistence was bearing fruit; it seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that the horse was giving way a trifle to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. Nobs was between him and the main herd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to which the yearling and filly had already fled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I stood waiting for Nobs' return, I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not but speculate upon my chances should I be at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacked by some formidable beast. I was some dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance from the forest and armed with weapons in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the use of which I was quite untrained, though I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had practiced some with the spear since leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kro-lu country. I must admit that my thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not pleasant ones, verging almost upon cow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ardice, until I chanced to think of little Ajor alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this same land and armed only with a knife! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was immediately filled with shame; but in thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter over since, I have come to the conclu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion that my state of mind was influenced largely</seg><seg type="columnLine">by my approximate nakedness. If you have never</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandered about in broad daylight garbed in a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of red-deer skin of inadequate length, you can have</seg><seg type="columnLine">no conception of the sensation of futility that over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelms one. Clothes, to a man accustomed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearing clothes, impart a certain self-confidence;</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of them induces panic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But no beast attacked me, though I saw several</seg><seg type="columnLine">menacing forms passing through the dark aisles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the forest. At last I commenced to worry over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nobs' protracted absence and to fear that some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing had befallen him. I was coiling my rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">to start out in search of him, when I saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stallion leap into view at almost the same spot be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind which he had disappeared, and at his heels</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran Nobs. Neither was running so fast or furiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">as when last I had seen them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The horse, as he approached me, I could see was</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboring hard; yet he kept gamely to his task, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nobs, too. The splendid fellow was driving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarry straight toward me. I crouched behind my</seg><seg type="columnLine">bush and laid my noose in readiness to throw. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two approached my hiding-place, Nobs reduced</seg><seg type="columnLine">his speed, and the stallion, evidently only too glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the respite, dropped into a trot. It was at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">gait that he passed me; my rope-hand flew forward;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the honda, well down, held the noose open, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful bay fairly ran his head into it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly he wheeled to dash off at right angles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I braced myself with the rope around my hip and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him to a sudden stand. Rearing and strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling, he fought for his liberty while Nobs, pant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and with lolling tongue, came and threw him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self down near me. He seemed to know that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">work was done and that he had earned his rest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The stallion was pretty well spent, and after a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes of struggling he stood with feet far spread,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nostrils dilated and eyes wide, watching me as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">edged slowly toward him, taking in the slack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rope as I advanced. A dozen times he reared</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tried to break away; but always I spoke sooth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly to him, and after an hour of effort I suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded in reaching his head and stroking his</seg><seg type="columnLine">muzzle. Then I gathered a handful of grass and</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered it to him, and always I talked to him in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet and reassuring voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had expected a battle royal; but on the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">1178</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">trary I found his taming a matter of comparative!</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease. Though wild, he was gentle to a degree, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of such remarkable intelligence that he soon dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered that I had no intention of harming him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After that, all was easy. Before that day was done,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had taught him to lead and to stand while I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroked his head and flanks, and to eat from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and had the satisfaction of seeing the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fear die in his large, intelligent eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The following day I fashioned a hackamore from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a piece which I cut from the end of my long Galu</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope, and then I mounted him fully prepared for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle of titanic proportions in which I was none</seg><seg type="columnLine">too sure that he would not come off victor; but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">never made the slightest effort to unseat me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from then on his education was rapid. No horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever learned more quickly the meaning of the rein</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the pressure of the knees. I think he soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned to love me, and I know that I loved him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he and Nobs were the best of pals. I called</seg><seg type="columnLine">him Ace. I had a friend who was once in the French</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying-corps, and when Ace let himself out, he cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly flew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I cannot explain to you, nor can you understand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless you too are a horseman, the exhilarating</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling of well-being which pervaded me from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment that I commenced riding Ace. I was a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, imbued with a sense of superiority that led</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to feel that I could go forth and conquer all</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caspak single-handed. Now, when I needed meat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I ran it down on Ace and roped it, and when some</seg><seg type="columnLine">great beast with which we could not cope threatened</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, we galloped away to safety; but for the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">part the creatures we met looked upon us in terror,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Ace and I in combination presented a new and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual beast beyond their experience and ken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For five days I rode back and forth across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">southern end of the Galu country without seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a human being; yet all the time I was working</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly toward the north, for I had determined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">comb the territory thoroughly in search of Ajor;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but on the fifth day as I emerged from a forest, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw some distance ahead of me a single small figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursued by many others. Instantly I recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quarry as Ajor. The entire party was fully a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile away from me, and they were crossing my</seg><seg type="columnLine">path at right angles, Ajor a few hundred yards in</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance of those who followed her. One of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuers was far in advance of the others, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaining upon her rapidly. With a word and a pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure of the knees I sent Ace leaping out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, and with Nobs running close alongside, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">raced toward her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first none of them saw us, but as we neared</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ajor, the pack behind the foremost pursuer discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered us and set up such a howl as I never before</seg><seg type="columnLine">have heard. They were all Galus, and I soon rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ognized the foremost as Du-seen. He was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Ajor now, and with a sense of terror such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had never before experienced, I saw that he ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his knife in his hand and that his intention</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to slay rather than capture. I could not under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand it; but I could only urge Ace to greater speed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and most nobly did the wondrous creature respond</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my demands. If ever a four-footed creature ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proximated flying, it was Ace that day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Rescue In the Quagmire</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DU-SEEN, intent upon his brutal design, had as</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet not noticed us. He was within a pace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ajor when Ace and I dashed between them, and I,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaning down to the left, swept my little barbarian</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the hollow of an arm and up to the withers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my glorious Ace. We had snatched her from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very clutches of Du-seen, who halted, mystified and</seg><seg type="columnLine">raging. Ajor, too, was mystified, as we had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">up from diagonally behind her so that she had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea that we were near until she was swung to Ace's</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. The little savage turned with drawn knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stab me, thinking that I was some new enemy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when her eyes found my face and she recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. With a little sob she threw her arms about</seg><seg type="columnLine">my neck, gasping: "My Tom! My Tom!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then Ace sank suddenly into thick mud to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">belly, and Ajor and I were thrown far over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. He had run into one of those numerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">springs which cover Caspak. Sometimes they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">little lakes, again but tiny pools, and often mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">quagmires of mud, as was this one overgrown with</seg><seg type="columnLine">lush grasses which effectually hid its treacherous</seg><seg type="columnLine">identity. It is a wonder that Ace did not break a</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg, so fast he was going when he fell; but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't, though with four good legs he was unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wallow from the mire. Ajor and I had sprawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">face down into the covering grasses and so had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not sunk deeply; but when we tried to rise, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that there was no footing, and presently we</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that Du-seen and his followers were coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">down upon us. There was no escape. It was evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent that we were doomed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Slay me!" begged Ajor. "Let me die at thy</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved hands rather than beneath the knife of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">hateful thing, for he will kill me. He has sworn</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kill me. Last night he captured me, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">later he would have had his way with me, I struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with my fists and with my knife I stabbed him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then I escaped, leaving him raging in pain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thwarted desire. To-day they searched for me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found me; and as I fled, Du-seen ran after me cry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that he would slay me. Kill me, my Tom, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then fall upon thine own spear, for they will kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">you horribly if they take you alive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I couldn't kill her--not at least until the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment; and I told her so, and that I loved her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that until death came, I would live and fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nobs had followed us into the bog and had done</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly well at first, but when he neared us, he too</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank to his belly and could only flounder about. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in this predicament when Du-seen and his fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowers approached the edge of the horrible swamp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw that Al-tan was with him and many other</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kro-lu warriors. The alliance against Jor the chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">had, therefore, been consummated, and this horde</seg><seg type="columnLine">was already marching upon the Galu city. I sighed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I thought how close I had been to saving not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only Ajor but her father and his people from de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feat and death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond the swamp was a dense wood. Could we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have reached this, we would have been safe; but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might as well have been a hundred miles away as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards across that hidden lake of sticky</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud. Upon the edge of the swamp Du-seen and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1179</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">horde halted to revile us. They could not reach us</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their hands; but at a command from Du-seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">they fitted arrows to their bows, and I saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end had come. Ajor huddled close to me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I took her in my arms. "I love you, Tom," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "only you." Tears came to my eyes then, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">tears of self-pity for my predicament, but tears</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a heart filled with a great love--a heart that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sees the sun of its life and its love setting even as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it rises.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The renegade Galus and their Kro-lu allies stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for the word from Du-seen that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">launch that barbed avalanche of death upon us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when there broke from the wood beyond the swamp</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sweetest music that ever fell upon the ears of</seg><seg type="columnLine">man--the sharp staccato of at least two score rifles</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired rapidly at will. Down went the Galu and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kro-lu warriors like tenpins before that deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusillade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What could it mean? To me it meant but one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, and that was that Hollis and Short and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others had scaled the cliffs and made their way north</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Galu country upon the opposite side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island in time to save Ajor and me from almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain death. I didn't have to have an introduc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to them to know that the men who held those</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifles were the men of my own party; and when,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few minutes later, they came forth from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">concealment, my eyes verified my hopes. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were, every man-jack of them; and with them</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a thousand straight, sleek warriors of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galu race; and ahead of the others came two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the garb of Galus. Each was tall and straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wonderfully muscled; yet they differed as Ace</seg><seg type="columnLine">might differ from a perfect specimen of another</seg><seg type="columnLine">species. As they approached the mire, Ajor held</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth her arms and cried, "Jor, my chief! My</seg><seg type="columnLine">father!" and the elder of the two rushed in knee-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep to rescue her, and then the other came closer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked into my face, and his eyes went wide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mine too, and I cried: "Bowen! For heaven's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sake, Bowen Tyler!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Lost Is Found Climbing the Cliffs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was he. My search was ended. Around me</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all my company and the man we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">searched a new world to find. They cut saplings</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the forest and laid a road into the swamp be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore they could get us all out, and then we marched</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the city of Jor the Galu chief, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was great rejoicing when Ajor came home again</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted upon the glossy back of the stallion Ace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tyler and Hollis and Short and all the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us Americans nearly worked our jaws loose on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">march back to the village, and for days afterward</seg><seg type="columnLine">we kept it up. They told me how they had crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barrier cliffs in five days, working twenty-four</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours a day in three eight-hour shifts with two re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liefs to each shift alternating half-hourly. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men with electric drills driven from the dynamos</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard the Toreador drilled two holes four feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart in the face of the cliff and in the same hori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zontal plane. The holes slanted slightly downward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Into these holes the iron rods brought as a part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our equipment and for just this purpose were in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted, extending about a foot beyond the face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rock, across these two rods a plank was laid, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">then the next shift, mounting to the new level,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bored two more holes five feet above the new plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form, and so on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the nights the searchlights from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toreador were kept playing upon the cliff at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point where the drills were working, and at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate of ten feet an hour the summit was reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the fifth day. Ropes were lowered, blocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashed to trees at the top, and crude elevators</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigged, so that by the night of the fifth day the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire party, with the exception of the few men</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed to man the Toreador, were within Caspak</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an abundance of arms, ammunition and</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From then on, they fought their way north in</seg><seg type="columnLine">search of me, after a vain and perilous effort to</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter the hideous reptile-infested country to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">south. Owing to the number of guns among them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had not lost a man; but their path was strewrn</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the dead creatures they had been forced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">slay to win their way to the north end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island, where they had found Bowen and his bride</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the Galus of Jor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The reunion between Bowen and Nobs was</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked by a frantic display upon Nobs' part,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which almost stripped Bowen of the scanty attire</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Galu custom had vouchsafed him. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">we arrived at the Galu city, Lys La Rue was wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to welcome us. She was Mrs. Tyler now, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the master of the Toreador had married them the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very day that the search-party had found them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though neither Lys nor Bowen would admit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">any civil or religious ceremony could have rendered</seg><seg type="columnLine">more sacred the bonds with which God had united</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neither Bowen nor the party from the Toreador</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen any sign of Bradley and his party. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been so long lost now that any hopes for them</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be definitely abandoned. The Galus had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumors of them, as had the Western Kro-lu and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Band-lu; but none had seen aught of them since</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had left Fort Dinosaur months since.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We rested in Jor's village for a fortnight while</seg><seg type="columnLine">we prepared for the southward journey to the point</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the Toreador was to lie offshore in wait for</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. During these two weeks Chal-az came up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kro-lu country, now a full-fledged Galu. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">told us that the remnants of Al-tan's party had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">slain when they attempted to reenter Kro-lu.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chal-az had been made chief, and when he rose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had left the tribe under a new leader whom all</seg><seg type="columnLine">respected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nobs stuck close to Bowen; but Ace and Ajor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I went out upon many long rides through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful north Galu country. Chal-az had brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">my arms and ammunition up from Kro-lu with him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but my clothes were gone; nor did I miss them</seg><seg type="columnLine">once I became accustomed to the free attire of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galu.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last came the time for our departure; upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the following morning we were to set out toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the south and the Toreador and dear old California.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	had asked Ajor to go with us; but Jor her father</seg><seg type="columnLine">had refused to listen to the suggestion. No pleas</seg><seg type="columnLine">could swerve him from his decision: Ajor, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cos-ata-lo, from whom might spring a new and</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater Caspakian race, could not be spared.

Even Cosmo Versal's explana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of it seeping into the earth's crust seems to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me rather inadequate. The idea of it evaporating</seg><seg type="columnLine">into space is of course impossible, once it had gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered upon the earth, because it could get no</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther than our atmosphere, which would hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more than a few inches at the most. About 25</seg><seg type="columnLine">per cent of the earth's surface is land and quite a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little of that is^ solid rock. I doubt if even six</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles of hydraulic pressure could force much water</seg><seg type="columnLine">into them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course the enormous pressure of the increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">depth over the old ocean beds would exert an up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaving influence to the higher ground and perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">pop out a few mountain peaks. It seems to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would never again be much more than 8 or 10</seg><seg type="columnLine">per cent of dry land for millions of years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Man Who Could Vanish," was very good</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the theory seemed rather vague. Somewhere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">several years ago (I think it must have been in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Electrical Experimenter) I read a story in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Invisibility was an issue. The principle there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirrors and prisms reflecting and refracting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light around the object.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the whole I enjoy every one of the stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">even though there may be some little technicality</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasionally, which is too much for me to grasp at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once.

However, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is quite possible that this condition could have pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vailed, not only on this planet, but on many other</seg><seg type="columnLine">like bodies somewhere in the universe. It should</seg><seg type="columnLine">always be remembered that, geologically, time, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">compared to human epochs, is infinite. It should</seg><seg type="columnLine">furthermore be remembered that a great deal of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere, and, therefore, water in the form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vapor, is lost right along into space. The grazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteorites are responsible for a good deal of this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Furthermore, at very high points in the atmosphere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth continuously loses billions of particles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">air every minute. Wihile small, during the course</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a year--so small, in fact, that it would be diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult to measure it--in the course of geological time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such losses reach tremendous figures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The latest geological time scale, based on physics,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shows us that the age of mammals--that is, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miocene and Oligocene periods--can be placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">about 16,000,000 years ago. The Mesozoic age of</seg><seg type="columnLine">reptiles dates back at least 150,000,000 years. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paleozoic age of fishes and amphibians dates back at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least 300,000,000 years, while the Precambrian</seg><seg type="columnLine">dates back at least one billion years. During such</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, -the losses are, of course, tremendous, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even a sheet of water six miles deep would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished entirely out into space long before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing of such a cycle.
