At -the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, not descending to chaffer, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply left without comment. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second, slightly irritated by the repeti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of rhe unsatisfactory answer to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquiry, he had asked for a better</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason. He knew that the ports of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sumatra were never busier. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">just returned from Colombo, to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">port he had freighted a full hold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dyewoods and gutta-percha with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise of more cargoes to come; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the sixty-mile passage of the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">from tihe sea to the port of Palembang</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stream w-as dotted with inward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">outward craft, the outward-bounders</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper of loadline than the incoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships. Yet he was hearing nothing but</seg><seg type="columnLine">luguibrious tales of poor trade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Trade is very good," he asserted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a dawning smile, to the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">merchant.

His smile grew more</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunny, however, and when he ?tc»od out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the building it broke into a veri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">table summer glow ; sure sign of rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> lu his lengthy career of free-lance</seg><seg type="columnLine">trading to all the port' in the eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">and southern seas, he had at times</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped on the corns of authority, petty</seg><seg type="columnLine">and august, as witness the tilt with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Commissioner of rhe Andamaris, the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiance and defeat of rhe Sultan of Zan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zibar, the utter discomfiture of a high</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mighty official in Mombasa: but</seg><seg type="columnLine">never had he expected to be compelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take up arms, even figuratively,</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the stolid merchants of Dutch</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sumatra.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiendish mind tha^ conceived the idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of driving Beauchamp and Saunders</seg><seg type="columnLine">away by means of venomous snakes had</seg><seg type="columnLine">overlooked two things: the uncertainty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any snake's voluntary movements;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the possibility of the carriers of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snakes becoming dissatisfied with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">employers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the latter event Tomking con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tributed largely, though unobtrusively,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Dutch Zim had also helped, perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">more largely, hoping to be one to profit</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the change. The cobras had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned loose in the ravine, instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Beauchamp's territory; and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">squirming brutes had scattered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One had crossed the gully in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness, no doubt seeking a snug lodg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for the night, and the pony bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saunders, trussed up as Beauchamp</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, stepped on the scaly tail. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lightninglike wrapping of snaky</seg><seg type="columnLine">coils about his leg, and the deadly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">poisonous fang stroke, that sent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little pony squealing back over the trail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snake clinging tight and striking</seg><seg type="columnLine">until flicked to ri'bbons by the mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Saunders experienced a madder</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mazeppa ride than ever Ruby suffered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the maddened beast he was tied on</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked and swerved in the futile effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fling off that clammy horror.

As</seg><seg type="columnLine">clarity returned, and his bodily discom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forts diminished to the point where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could ignore them, his mitid, which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never wavered from the problem of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls' disappearance, was capable oi</seg><seg type="columnLine">pondering his own present problems a*</seg><seg type="columnLine">well. The men who had first captured</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, transported him, and now released</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. had left him on a low ledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">crumbling stone, and he could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">them above and around him. their</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices calling to each other indicating a</seg><seg type="columnLine">measure of apprehension and an eager-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness for shelter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the rain came down as it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Ruby Beauchamp, in sheets, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flurries, and torrents.

The next mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, still without a cry, the pair were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling over the ledge into the unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths.

In spite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the shrew's tongue sauce with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the food was served, it was undeniably</seg><seg type="columnLine">excellent.

A look of re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lief vied with the sorrow in the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. The eyes slid round to Derr and</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught him staring. Instantly the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lief was displaced by fear, rampant fear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another point of interest. Derr sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in his chair and inspected, fur a</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, the ceiling. When he dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes the prisoner was still watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">him furtively. Certainly there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something familiar about the grimy fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures of the boy even as there was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Derr purposely began to stare.

It was a wretched haircut.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apparently the barber had employed</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheep shears. The eyebrows, perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">crescents, were dark, almost black. Odd</seg><seg type="columnLine">combination, red hair and dark eye-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brows. Where was it that he had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a combination? It was recently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was positive.

The marshal's wife, suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficiently annoyed as she was with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">husband, was not one to stand by quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he was mishandled. She flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">the frying pan. It was good line, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">over. The frying pan smashed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">both the upper and lower sashes, show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the shoulders of the fleeing pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oner with broken glass, and came to rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dust of the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Derr, who had sprung to his feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled himself through the window a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short length behind the prisoner.

Cutherton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not regret his failure to wallop</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cutherton the night before, Mr. Marks</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not of a disposition to fight man to</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. In that locality where he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised, it was the system to knife them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in tlie back, or attack in gangs. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">admitted of the maximum amount of</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety to one's self, a condition that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marks enthusiastically preferred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But for the purposes of constructive</seg><seg type="columnLine">revenge, Mr. Marka had gathered about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him half a dozeu more or less young</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who were famous for their utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of scruples. There were three bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glars, a highwayman and two pickpock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ets.

They,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, were agreed in the project.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Certainly it was an easy way to pick up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little extra money, Marks having stip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ulated that he only wanted Cutherton</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Try an' stick a coupla black eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him," instructed Marks.

Git me ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They "got" him and promised to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. One raised the question of how</seg><seg type="columnLine">much more tliey were to get. Marks</seg><seg type="columnLine">was prodigal in his promises.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was noontime in the great open</seg><seg type="columnLine">spaces of the Twenty-third Street line.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A street car slowly wended its weary</seg><seg type="columnLine">way eastward; its driver, one Cutherton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">being wearier. He had negotiated</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broadway after a series of exaspera-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, and had stopped at Madison Ave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nue. Passengers got aboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would be well now to take one last,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopeless look at Cutherton who was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way to doom in the form of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished and painstaking beating. A few</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocks distant, five journeymen gang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sters, entirely capable of their task</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaited Cutherton. Judging by the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">he argued with passengers and growled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself, was blissfully unaware of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this awaiting business. He was due for</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprises in bunches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That scowl with which he regarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world, was soon going to undergo</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressionistic treatment--and color-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two bells sounded, and he yanked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">levers. It would seem that he wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hurry to his fate. The fact was. he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was two minutes behind his schedule,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was anxious to make it up. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have sped the block between Mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ison and Fourth Avenues, if he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have. Not even would he have looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at the recruiting station, the flag of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which beckoned over the sidewalk. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had forgotten for once the mockery</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the legend:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Men wanted for the navy. See the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world and learn a trade."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another sign was occupying his at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention; it read: "I. Guldenstein,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meats," and was emblazoned on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear of a delivery wagon that was pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeding tranquilly along the tracks</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead. The beast that drew it, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one that drove it were magnificently</seg><seg type="columnLine">unheeding of the bell which Cutherton</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clanging constantly. It was a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to give vent to anger, so Cuther-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton clanged more and louder. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagon made no move to get out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally the motorman could control</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself no longer. Opening his front</seg><seg type="columnLine">window and leaning out he yelled:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey, you blankety blank!

Cutherton was desperate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">again he yanked those levers, giving all</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible speed to the car. He was sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would be at least three inches of</seg><seg type="columnLine">room for him to pass--ample in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">estimation of a motorman. He let her</seg><seg type="columnLine">go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crash! Creak! Thud !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked down and saw the left rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel of Mr. Guldenstein's propertv</seg><seg type="columnLine">crumple and the wagon settle on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hub, a wreck. He slammed on the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing the car to a stop with such sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denness that he^ nearly went through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was really too much. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to see if he had unhorsed any pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sengers. He hadn't; much to his re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gret. The driver of the wagon had</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped down from the seat and w^as</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelling all manner of remonstrance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anathema, invective, and what not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cutherton was surveying the damage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A crowd was gathering on the sidewalk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked out over it wondering what</seg><seg type="columnLine">next to do, when that recruiting flag</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved into his line of vision.

The course</seg><seg type="columnLine">of action became clear as crystal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> William Cutherton, erstwhile motor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, then and there calmly removed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cap and meticulously placed it on a seat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Off came his uniform coat next, and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">he folded tenderly and placed beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cap. From an inside pocket he calmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">took some papers, glanced at them as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though to reassure himself, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped down to the pavement. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked to the sidewalk and up the stairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the recruiting office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Would they enlist him?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The officer in charge looked at his pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pers.

Down in the Here's</seg><seg type="columnLine">How tea room, the party with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the town drunkard was celebrating his</seg><seg type="columnLine">weekly birthday was just getting into</seg><seg type="columnLine">its stride. At one end of the oil-lit</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, Con Meyer, the tea room's owner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was methodically kicking the limp body</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the smasher of his glasses toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, grinning as he imitated, in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bull's voice, the screams of a painted</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl who was still sober enough to watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Among the tables which dotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dance floor half a hundred couples,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ninety per cent male and one hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">per cent intoxicated, stamped about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowning the music of a disreputable</seg><seg type="columnLine">phonograph with their maudlin yells. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to Peter Martin that the clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">clatter of pebbles under foot would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">preferable to his ears; and so, kicking</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet as much as possible among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubble, he started down the slope to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had advanced about fifty yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the almost simultaneous sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a motor horn, a revolver shot, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman's scream, cutting in sharply</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> above the more distant medley of sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Here's How, made him stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead for an instant, then drop his pack</seg><seg type="columnLine">and run at top speed toward the nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row track which ran around the ridge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Virgin Mine to Hades City.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  From the time of the gold rushes on-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward to the present, the empire west</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Mississippi has seemed, by some</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange automatic process, to separate</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself into two perfectly distinct parts--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desirable and the undesirable; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without statutes or police, to segregate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter of these sections. In 'forty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine there were hundreds of more-or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less-permanent towns peopled entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">by desperately hard-working men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore no guns; and there were perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">six camps in which every man went</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed, with the avenger of blood at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When, in later years, the cattle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great ranges gave place to sheep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was civil war in perhaps three</seg><seg type="columnLine">counties; elsewhere not a shot was fired.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And it is the same to-day, as the oil</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and the miners are butting into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheepman's hard-won domain. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a dozen towns the white lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">never go out; death patrols the streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">by night and by day, while in the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the country millions of people of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom one never hears continue to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard by day and sleep soundly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">safely at night. There is something</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the open spaces which gives men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and women with the small, weak crim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inal soul an irresistible longing for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">companionship of their own kind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  On the last evening of Peter Martin's</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay in Hades City four gentlemen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this stripe, stimulated by each other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence and much bad whisky, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually gained courage to shamble be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the city limits and to hold up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their eight revolvers a battered tin motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">car containing a girl. One shot had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been fired--the bullet had torn through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the radiator ?nd flattened itself against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long-suffering engine--and as Peter</seg><seg type="columnLine">us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PEOPLE'S STORY MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin, hammer in hand, passed a clump</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sagebrush ten yards from the halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">car the man who had tired stumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, and with a howl of drunken</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter stretched out his arms toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl in the driver's seat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not touch her, however.

And the next instant a</seg><seg type="columnLine">list accustomed to swing that hammer</seg><seg type="columnLine">against unyielding quartz met the chin</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a second holdup man with a thud,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocking him head first over the hood</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the little car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ''It's tlie Easterner!" mumbled one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two remaining.

He realized his mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">take at once, and, turning, started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">run. With a short laugh and a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">leap Peter Martin dropped his flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and sixty pounds of weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the fugitive's shoulders, at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant swinging a terrible right up un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the ear.

Not a word</seg><seg type="columnLine">was spoken, except that once, as Peter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fisit came heavily home on his antago-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nist's nose the injured man gasped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Jee-miny!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was scarcely five seconds after this</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclamation had broken the snarling si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence that Peter put into execution a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trick he had chanced to pick up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">West.

It was the upper man's turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">to relax now', and he did it very com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely. He rolled off Peter with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent object of burying his face in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the asphalt, and lay still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peter rose.
