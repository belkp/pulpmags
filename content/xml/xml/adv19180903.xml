The breast of the </p><p>latter’s blue flannel shirt was stiff with </p><p>what had dried upon it. Jake’s expert </p><p>fingers opened and spread apart the shirt. </p><p> “My Gawd!” exclaimed Kansas, who was</p><p>young and therefore emotional. </p><p> “Looks like that chest had been run</p><p>through a sewin’ machine,” observed Jake. </p><p>“Throat’s cut half-through,” he supple- </p><p>mented, with an eye to detail. </p><p> “His face!” whispered Kansas in a dry</p><p>voice. </p><p> For the dead man did not have any face,</p><p>that is, a face his friends could recognize. </p><p>The features had been smashed and beaten </p><p>to a pulpy flatness. </p><p> “Who is he?” asked Kansas.</p><p> “He’s wearin’ Rufe Thompson’s clo’es,”</p><p>replied the sheriff. “Guess you dunno </p><p>Rufe. He’s Sile Thompson’s brother. </p><p>Sile’s manager o’ the Slash F outfit over</p><p>south o’ Seymour. I dunno him myself, </p><p>an’ I didn’t know Rufe either till I had </p><p>a drink with him last night. Rufe only </p><p>sifted in yest’day.” </p><p> While the sheriff talked his hands had</p><p>been searching the dead man’s clothing. </p><p>He brought to light and laid at one side a </p><p>silver watch, a six-shooter in a shoulder </p><p>holster, a fifty-cent piece, a quarter and an </p><p>unsealed letter addressed to Scotty Mac- </p><p>kenzie of the Flying M—that ranch is </p><p>situated in the valley of the Dogsoldier </p><p>beyond Paradise Eend. Jake opened and </p><p>read the letter. </p><p> Kansas drew the revolver from its holster</p><p>and examined the cylinder. Then he </p><p>Copyright, i9l8, ly The Ridgway Company in the United States and Great Britain. All rights reserved. </p><p>3 </p><p>4	Adventure</p><p>extracted the cylinder and squinted down </p><p>the gun’s long barrel. </p><p> “Glean,” he announced. “Five car-</p><p>tridges in the cylinder.” </p><p> “Oh, he didn’t have no more chance than</p><p>a ory-eyed Injun,” said Jake Rule, and </p><p>tapped the letter with a blunt forefinger. </p><p>“It’s Rufe shore-enough. This here to </p><p>Scotty is all about a bunch o’ horses Sile </p><p>wants to buy. Wonder why they pulled </p><p>his shirt-tail out of his pants,” he added </p><p>irrelevantly. </p><p> “Maybe he done it when he was dyin’,”</p><p>suggested Kansas. </p><p> “Maybe. Yuh can’t tell. Take his feef,</p><p>will yuh, Kansas?” </p><p>CHAPTER I </p><p>THE STRANGER </p><p>&lt;"\X7'HO is he?” queried “Piney” Jackson, </p><p>▼ » the blacksmith, leaning comfortably </p><p>against the off-jamb of his wide doorway. </p><p> “I dunno,” replied “Windy” Taylor,</p><p>slouching on an up-ended bucket beside the </p><p>cooling tub. “I’ve never seen him before.” </p><p>“Me neither,” declared the blacksmith, </p><p>and scratched his shoulders heifer-wise on </p><p>the wood. </p><p> “Whadda yuh wanna know for?” List-</p><p>lessly. </p><p> Piney Jackson surveyed the puncher</p><p>with contempt. </p><p> “Ain’t you Double Diamond A fellers</p><p>got no curiosity?” he demanded. </p><p> “Not a-cure,” grinned Windy. “We</p><p>ain’t got no time. We work, we do. We </p><p>don’t sit on our hunkers come day, go day, </p><p>shoe a mule once a year, like some jiggers </p><p>I know.” </p><p> “Is that so?” snorted the blacksmith,</p><p>and fairly upset his slow-witted brain for a </p><p>suitable and crushing retort. The latter </p><p>failing to materialize he dodged back to </p><p>the main question. “Alla same, I’d like to</p><p>know who Mister High Pockets is.” </p><p> “Why don’tcha ask him? Yuh dunno,</p><p>he might tell yuh.” </p><p> Piney Jackson treated Mr. Taylor’s</p><p>flippancy with the disdain it deserved and </p><p>continued to gaze diagonally across the </p><p>street at the object of his curiosity. Which </p><p>object was a tall, lanky man, occupying </p><p>one of the two chairs on the sidewalk </p><p>beneath the wooden awning of Bill Lainey’s </p><p>hotel. One of the chairs was filled to </p><p>overflowing by that mountain of lazy flesh, </p><p>Bill Lainey himself. Lainey, as was his </p><p>custom, dozed with abandon. His snores </p><p>and gurgles were not audible to the men </p><p>in the doorway of the blacksmith shop, </p><p>but they knew what he was doing. </p><p> The stranger was not sleeping. Chair</p><p>tilted back against the wall, spurred heels </p><p>hooked on a rung, he stared straight in </p><p>front of him with a pair of humorous and </p><p>washed-out gray eyes. Apparently his </p><p>scrutiny was directed upon Dave Smith’s </p><p>pony, tied to the well-chewed post in front </p><p>of the Smith residence. After a time the </p><p>stranger swept the figures of the blacksmith </p><p>and Mr. Taylor with a calm, impersonal </p><p>glance and then looked out across the hot </p><p>flat to where the trail from Marysville and </p><p>the south dropped down the slope of Indian </p><p>Ridge. A cloud of dust was on the trail. </p><p>The northbound stage was coming in. </p><p> The stranger’s eyes switched back to</p><p>the pony tied to the post. He fished with </p><p>lean brown fingers in a pocket of his vest, </p><p>produced the makings and rolled a cigaret, </p><p>employing for that purpose both hands. </p><p> When he had blown out his first deep</p><p>inhale, the white teeth beneath the stubby </p><p>brown mustache showed in a slow half- </p><p>smile, a smile that faded as slowly as it came. </p><p>For the stranger was missing nothing of </p><p>Messrs. Jackson’s and Taylor’s studiedly </p><p>unobtrusive stares. And they amused him, </p><p>those stares. He had played draw with </p><p>the blacksmith and two of the latter’s </p><p>friends in the Happy Heart the evening </p><p>before, and he had taken their money away </p><p>from them. This also had amused him. A </p><p>beneficent Providence having blessed him </p><p>with a spacious talent for poker and its </p><p>by-products, he was frequently enabled to</p><p>derive from life much innocent pleasure </p><p>and more coin of the realm, which was </p><p>proper. </p><p> A trickle of passers-by crossed the</p><p>stranger’s field of vision: Mike Flynn, the </p><p>one-legged owner of the Blue Pigeon Store, </p><p>with a seafaring roll in his walk that even </p><p>a brass-bound mahogany pegleg could not </p><p>eradicate; plump Mrs. Rule, the sheriff’s </p><p>wife, intent on dotted calico and baking- </p><p>powder; the amiable owner of the Canton </p><p>Restaurant, tall Sing Luey, resplendent in </p><p>black silk trousers and embroidered over- </p><p>shirt, meditatively sucking the mouth- </p><p>piece of his yard-long silver-mounted pipe, </p><p>intent on heaven knew what dream of his </p><p>High Pockets </p><p>5 </p><p>own home-town; and pale-faced Mr. Tom </p><p>Stute, frock-coated, wearing a shirt of </p><p>many pleats and his perennial smile. </p><p>Clean-shaven, handsome, debonair to a </p><p>degree, Mr. Stute, proprietor and manager </p><p>of the Dewdrop Dance-Hall, was a picture </p><p>to fill any one’s eye. </p><p> The stranger surveyed the march past</p><p>of Mr. Stute from beneath half-closed </p><p>eyelids. He was not sure that he liked </p><p>Mr. Stute. Shooting at random, as it </p><p>were, he believed he preferred that in- </p><p>scrutable Celestial, Sing Luey, to Mr. </p><p>Stute. There was that about the dance- </p><p>hall person, a subtle cocksureness among </p><p>other little traits, that grated. The </p><p>stranger had not the pleasure of Mr. </p><p>Stute’s acquaintance, nor did he greatly </p><p>care for Chinamen, but he had a vast and </p><p>childlike faith in his own instinct. </p><p> A thudding patter drummed across the</p><p>heat waves of the flat. The stranger </p><p>looked southward along the trail. A quar- </p><p>ter-mile away, dimly visible through rolling </p><p>clouds of dust, the legs of the stage horses </p><p>were twinkling in a frantic gallop. Came </p><p>the pistol-like crack of a whip—once, </p><p>twice, and again. “Whisky Jim” was </p><p>encouraging his teams. Whisky Jim </p><p>whooped a series of shrill whoops. </p><p> “Must be haulin’ a woman,” the stranger,</p><p>wise as to the practise of stage-drivers, </p><p>concluded. </p><p> Creaking and swaying, curtains flapping,</p><p>the stage whirled past. With a hearty </p><p>shout, Whisky Jim straightened a leg on </p><p>the brake lever and swayed back on the </p><p>bunched reins. The stage ground to a halt </p><p>in front of the stage station. Whisky Jim </p><p>set the brake and climbed down. The </p><p>stranger watched lazily. Whisky Jim </p><p>opened the stage door, stretched in a long </p><p>arm and dragged out a large valise. </p><p> “Ladies first!” bawled Whisky Jim, as a</p><p>trousered leg appeared, the foot feeling </p><p>for the step. </p><p> The leg and foot jerked backward, dis-</p><p>appeared, and then slowly, hesitatingly, </p><p>the slim figure of a girl in dusty dark blue</p><p>stepped out and down. She was a little </p><p>thing, this girl. The stranger decided as </p><p>he looked at her standing there beside her </p><p>great valise, that she possessed the smallest </p><p>feet he had ever seen. </p><p> The owner of the trousered leg that had</p><p>annoyed Whisky Jim scuttled out with a </p><p>cautious eye to the stage driver and van- </p><p>ished within the Happy Heart Saloon. </p><p>Whisky Jim turned to help the Wells Fargo </p><p>guard with the express box and the mail- </p><p>bags. The girl stood beside her valise and </p><p>gazed upon the false fronts of Farewell. </p><p> “Don’t she belong to nobody?” the</p><p>stranger asked himself, and removed his </p><p>heels from the chair rung. </p><p> Mr. Stute hurried out into the street and</p><p>approached the girl. Mr. Stute achieved </p><p>a low bow and a hat flourish. It must be </p><p>said that Mr. Stute had title to certain </p><p>airs and graces. Mr. Stute, his head bent </p><p>deferentially, spoke at some length to the </p><p>girl. The stranger could not hear what he </p><p>was saying. </p><p> “Dance-hall floozie,” he said to himself,</p><p>and rehooked his heels. “Must belong to </p><p>Stute.” </p><p> He set himself to the rolling of a fresh</p><p>cigaret. He had lost all interest in the girl. </p><p> But the interest returned full force when,</p><p>presently, came toward him along the side- </p><p>walk Mr. Stute and the girl. Now the </p><p>stranger had a fair view of her face. It </p><p>was not a beautiful face, but it was a sweet </p><p>face, and the expression made it very lovely. </p><p>There was strength in the wide mouth and </p><p>firm chin. There was sadness in the wide- </p><p>set dark eyes as she glanced at the stranger </p><p>in passing. Promptly he revised his pre- </p><p>vious estimate. </p><p> “She never was in a dance-hall in her</p><p>life,” he told himself. </p><p> Mr. Stute awakened Bill Lainey and in-</p><p>formed the hotel proprietor that the lady </p><p>desired a room. </p><p> “Not an expensive room,” put in the girl.</p><p>“I—I can’t pay very much.” </p><p> “Rooms all the same price,” said Bill</p><p>Lainey, heaving himself erect. “They’s </p><p>only two—eight beds in each, dollar a bed </p><p>a day.” </p><p> At which the girl looked blank, and Mr.</p><p>Stute drew Mr. Lainey aside and whispered </p><p>in his ear. </p><p> “All right,” wheezed Bill, and spoke to</p><p>the girl. “Yuh can have the young-un’s </p><p>room. Four-bits a day.” </p><p> “Four-bits?” repeated the girl uncom-</p><p>prehendingly. </p><p> “Fifty cents,” explained Bill Lainey.</p><p> “I don’t understand if beds are one dollar</p><p>a day, how-” </p><p> “That’s all right,” Mr. Stute assured</p><p>her, clapping Bill on the shoulder. “That’s </p><p>a-all right. My friend, Mister Lainey, is </p><p>6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>making you a special rate. Special rates </p><p>to tourists, you know. Mister Lainey did </p><p>not know you were a tourist—at first.” </p><p> “But-”</p><p> “Don’t think of it further, madam. The</p><p>matter is settled. You must be tired. </p><p>Mister Lainey will conduct you to your </p><p>room at once.” </p><p> The girl attempted to thank Mr. Stute.</p><p>He raised a deprecating hand. </p><p> “Don’t mention it, madam. No trouble</p><p>at all. Delighted to have been of service. </p><p>I may see you again—later. I hope—I </p><p>may. Thank you, Bill, here’s the lady’s </p><p>bag.” </p><p> Lainey and the girl went into the hotel.</p><p>Mr. Stute, curling his mustache with satis- </p><p>fied fingers, strolled away toward his dance- </p><p>hall. The stranger watched the smoke curl </p><p>upward from the end of his cigaret. </p><p> “An’ yo’re gonna see her again, are yuh?”</p><p>he said under his breath. “I wonder </p><p>whyfor.” </p><p>CHAPTER II </p><p>A JOB </p><p>*	| 'HE stranger saw the girl at supper.</p><p> She sat opposite, an empty chair on</p><p>either hand. The few diners, stray punch- </p><p>ers and the stage station employees, ate </p><p>with diffidence. They were not accus- </p><p>tomed to women of the girl’s species. </p><p> The stranger surreptitiously watched her</p><p>while she ate. He was glad that she had </p><p>removed her hat. He enjoyed looking at </p><p>her hair. It was so darkly brown and </p><p>smooth and shiny. The girl’s appetite </p><p>could have been better. She merely pecked </p><p>at the sowbelly and beans, but she ate all </p><p>her canned tomatoes and drank two cups </p><p>of the terrifically strong coffee. </p><p> The meal over, the girl disappeared.</p><p>The stranger, in his chair on the sidewalk </p><p>could hear her moving about her room.</p><p>After a time all sound of movement ceased. </p><p>Later the stranger thought he heard stifled </p><p>sobbing. But he could not be sure. </p><p> Came then through the dusk Mr. Stute,</p><p>walking rapidly. He entered the hotel. </p><p>Bill Lainey was indoors cleaning his rifle. </p><p> “Where’s the little lady?” inquired Mr.</p><p>Stute. </p><p> “In her room,” replied Bill, to the</p><p>accompaniment of a squirted oil can’s </p><p>double click. </p><p> “Ask her if she’ll see me.”</p><p> The Lainey feet shuffled across the floor.</p><p>The Lainey knuckles rapped on a door. </p><p> “Gent to see yuh, ma’am,” said Bill.</p><p>“He’s the gent brung yuh here—Mister </p><p>Tom Stute.” </p><p> The stranger leaned across his chair arm</p><p>and nearer the doorway. He could not </p><p>catch the girl’s answer. Her voice was </p><p>pitched too low. </p><p> “Says she can’t see nobody now,” Bill</p><p>told Mr. Stute. </p><p> Mr. Stute came out and went away.</p><p>The set of his head and shoulders hinted </p><p>at displeasure. The stranger waited a long </p><p>five minutes. Then he followed in the </p><p>wake of the dance-hall proprietor to the </p><p>latter’s place of business. </p><p> The shank of the evening was but be-</p><p>ginning in the Dewdrop. The fiddler on </p><p>his table was sawing out the merry strains </p><p>of “Zip Coon” in perfunctory fashion. </p><p>Windy Taylor was endeavoring to waltz </p><p>with a painted blonde and making a boggy </p><p>ford of it. It was evident that the Double </p><p>Diamond A puncher had had several. The </p><p>blonde was making fun of him. As they </p><p>slid past the doorway she expertly dis- </p><p>engaged herself and propelled Windy to the </p><p>bar. They drank, and the blonde added </p><p>another check to her string. </p><p> There were five women in the Dewdrop</p><p>Dance-Hall, good-looking and light-footed </p><p>females all of them, well-assorted too—a </p><p>pair of blondes, two brunettes, and a red- </p><p>haired girl. For Mr. Stute knew the value</p><p>of display advertising. </p><p> The stranger draped himself against the</p><p>bar and poured out a modest two fingers. </p><p> “Buy me a drink, dearie.”</p><p> It was the red-haired girl, a full-bosomed</p><p>Cyprian with excellent teeth. She was </p><p>nudging his elbow. </p><p> “Help yoreself,” he said, and eyed her</p><p>indifferently. </p><p> “Le’s dance,” she invited, when she had</p><p>swallowed her liquor. </p><p> “I dunno how,” he equivocated.</p><p> “I’ll teach yuh.” She laid a plump hand</p><p>on his arm. </p><p> “Yuh dunno what yo’re sayin’,” he</p><p>grinned. “Once a girl tried to teach me to </p><p>dance, an’ she’s been walkin’ lame ever </p><p>since.” </p><p> “That’s all right,” she giggled. “Come</p><p>along.” </p><p> But the stranger would not, and the red-</p><p>haired creature left him to essay her wiles </p><p>High Pockets </p><p>7 </p><p>on Tom Barton of the Hogpen outfit. The </p><p>stranger sipped his whisky and stared into </p><p>the long mirror behind the bar. He could </p><p>see the reflection of Mr. Stute in the mirror. </p><p>Mr. Stute was talking to one “Longhorn” </p><p>Simms, a swarthy citizen with a broken </p><p>nose. </p><p> Mr. Simms was a person of some local</p><p>reputation. He ran the games in the </p><p>Happy Heart Saloon. He had killed two </p><p>men in the way of his profession and wore </p><p>derringers in his vest-pockets. The name </p><p>Longhorn fitted. He was excessively hard. </p><p>Now he was smiling—as the wolf smiles </p><p>when it licks its jaws. Mr. Stute was </p><p>chuckling. He was apparently telling Mr. </p><p>Simms a story both pithy and pointed. </p><p>“Zip Coon” drowned his words. </p><p> The stranger moved across the room to a</p><p>window adjacent to the gambler and the </p><p>story-teller. He put his hand on the sill </p><p>and looked out into the night. </p><p> “Tomorrow I’ll turn the trick,” Mr.</p><p>Stute was saying. “I don’t know but that </p><p>I’ll keep her myself—for a while. She’s too </p><p>good for the floor now.” </p><p> “Yuh’ll have to work it easy-like.”</p><p>Thus Longhorn Simms, spitting at a crack. </p><p>“Easy’s where I live.” </p><p> “If she’s good like yuh think, it won’t be</p><p>no cinch. I knowed a good woman once. </p><p>Couldn’t budge her. I know.” </p><p> “I’ll budge this one. She hasn’t any</p><p>money to speak of. And she hasn’t a </p><p>friend in the Territory. I got that much </p><p>out of her. Do you see it? Not a friend in </p><p>the Territory.” </p><p> “An’ you’ll be her friend.” The wolfish</p><p>smile on the mouth of Mr. Simms turned </p><p>sarcastic. </p><p> “I sure will.”</p><p> “Betcha fifty yuh get the mitten.”</p><p>“Make it a hundred, and give me two </p><p>days.” </p><p> “Shore. A hundred an’ two days goes.</p><p>Le’s irrigate.” </p><p> The two crossed to the bar. The</p><p>stranger sat down on the window sill. </p><p>Ten minutes later he left the dance-hall </p><p>and went to the Happy Heart to play stud. </p><p> The stranger rose late the following</p><p>morning. He was alone in the eight- </p><p>bedded room. The other guests, two </p><p>punchers and a stray-man, were at break- </p><p>fast. When he had pulled on his boots, and </p><p>settled his hair with a sweep of his hand, </p><p>he took his six-shooter from its holster </p><p>and drew out the cylinder. He inspected </p><p>the five cartridges, replaced the cylinder, </p><p>and carefully settled the hammer on the </p><p>empty chamber. He shoved the weapon </p><p>into its holster, buckled on the belt, and </p><p>tied down the holster. As every one </p><p>knows, tying down a holster makes for a </p><p>sure draw. Gun-fighters employ this pro- </p><p>cedure extensively. </p><p> Which being done the stranger went to</p><p>his war-bags where they lay on the floor, </p><p>opened them and pulled from beneath </p><p>his extra shirt the mate to the six-shooter </p><p>on his right leg. This firearm he treated </p><p>precisely as he had the other, save that </p><p>when it was in readiness for action he </p><p>shoved it down inside the waistband of his </p><p>trousers, so that it cuddled his body slightly </p><p>ahead of the right hip-bone. </p><p> From the other half of his war-bags he</p><p>produced a heavy-bladed, thin-handled </p><p>bowie. This knife he inserted in a leather </p><p>sheath cunningly sewn into the back of his </p><p>vest high up at the neck on the right-hand </p><p>side. Then he put on the vest, wriggled </p><p>his shoulders till the bowie lay snugly where </p><p>it should, and went down to breakfast. </p><p> The girl was the sole occupant of the</p><p>dining-room. When he pulled out his </p><p>chair, she returned his greeting timidly </p><p>her eye on her plate. The stranger ate </p><p>hurriedly, but the girl finished before he </p><p>did and went out into the street. </p><p> The stranger set down his half-emptied</p><p>coffee-cup and walked to the doorway. </p><p>Standing well back he watched her enter the </p><p>Blue Pigeon Store. He waited till she </p><p>came out and started back toward the </p><p>hotel. Then he slid through the doorway</p><p>and dropped into his accustomed chair. </p><p>When she passed him on her way in he saw </p><p>that she held in her hand a few spools of </p><p>thread and a paper of needles. </p><p> “Gonna do a li’l sewin’,” he told himself.</p><p>“She’s gonna stay some while, anyhow.” </p><p> In a few minutes he heard the snip-snip</p><p>of scissors. He smiled his slow half-smile </p><p>and rolled a cigaret. </p><p> Bill Lainey shuffled past the corner of</p><p>the hotel. </p><p> “Yore hoss an’ Dolan’s mule is fightin’,”</p><p>he wheezed, “an’ me, I’ve gotta go to the </p><p>store for the wife.” </p><p> The stranger swore and ran ’round the</p><p>building to the corral. On the way he </p><p>picked up a five-foot length of two-by-four. </p><p>Bill Lainey had told the truth. Rear, </p><p>8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>strike, whirl, kick and recover, the mule </p><p>and the stranger’s hammer-headed yellow </p><p>were going it tooth and hoof. Handling </p><p>the two-by-four as if it were a lath the </p><p>stranger hammered Dolan’s mule and his </p><p>own horse on the nose with charming im- </p><p>partiality. But it was a grudge fight and </p><p>both brutes were red-eyed with rage. </p><p>They minded him not at all at first, and </p><p>only his natural agility saved him from </p><p>being brained. </p><p> He beat them apart at last, whacked</p><p>them soundly over their rumps and drove </p><p>them to their respective corners. He </p><p>climbed upon the top bar of the gate and </p><p>sat, the two-by-four across his knees, </p><p>awaiting the return of the fighting spirit. </p><p>But the two animals had had enough. </p><p>They were content to sulk where they stood </p><p>and tenderly shake their aching heads. </p><p>The stranger watched them grimly for a </p><p>space. Then he dropped the two-by-four, </p><p>climbed down, and returned to his chair </p><p>in front of the hotel. </p><p>I THE Dewdrop Dance-Hall lay on </p><p>Ir&amp;jlthe same side of Main Street as </p><p>■LaBJ Lainey’s Hotel. Almost directly </p><p>opposite the dance-hall was Sing Luey’s </p><p>Canton Restaurant. The dance-hall’s win- </p><p>dows and doors were all open, front and </p><p>rear. Tall Sing Luey, standing in his door- </p><p>way, had a fairly comprehensive view of </p><p>the interior of that dance-hall. Sing Luey, </p><p>sucking his long pipe, which no one had ever </p><p>seen him smoke, stood motionless, his legs </p><p>widespread. </p><p> Suddenly he stepped down on the side-</p><p>walk and shuffled across the street in the </p><p>direction of Lainey’s Hotel. In front of </p><p>Daly’s place he halted and became deeply </p><p>absorbed in the antics of Dolan’s chained </p><p>bear as it vigorously hunted itself for fleas. </p><p>A few minutes later Sing Luey passed on </p><p>and paused beside the stranger’s chair. </p><p> “Fine day,” said Sing Luey.</p><p> The stranger stared at the Chinaman in</p><p>frank surprise. Sing Luey’s accent was </p><p>not the Chinese accent to which he was </p><p>accustomed. He nodded curtly. </p><p> “Yeah,” said the stranger.</p><p> Sing Luey smiled balmily and caressed</p><p>the tiny bowl of his pipe. </p><p> “I have some very fine li-chi nuts,” went</p><p>on Sing Luey. “They arrived from China </p><p>only last week. I should like you to try </p><p>those nuts.” </p><p> The stranger continued to stare. The</p><p>yellow face beamed down upon him. </p><p> “We do not all talk the pidgin,” he said</p><p>gently. </p><p> “I can see that easy, but-”</p><p> “Those nuts are—excellent.”</p><p> The right eyelid of the Chinaman half-</p><p>dropped. </p><p> “I dunno what yo’re drivin’ at,” puzzled</p><p>the stranger. </p><p> “You need not come beyond the doorway</p><p>if you do not wish,” Sing Luey persisted. </p><p>“If you do not come you may be sorry.” </p><p>He broke off, his inscrutable eyes holding </p><p>those of the stranger. “You will come, </p><p>please,” he added softly, and turned on his </p><p>slippered heel. </p><p> The stranger got unhurriedly to his feet.</p><p>He hitched up his trousers and kicked the </p><p>kinks out of his long legs. Briskly he </p><p>crossed the street, caught up with Sing </p><p>Luey, passed him and entered the Canton. </p><p>The dining-room was empty. From the </p><p>kitchen came the sound of shifted pots and </p><p>pans and the shush of disturbed water. </p><p>The stranger leaned back against the wall. </p><p> In slipped Sing Luey and stood beside a</p><p>front window, his eyes on the dance-hall </p><p>opposite. </p><p> “About them nuts—” began the stranger.</p><p> “Perhaps the nuts can wait,” the Celestial</p><p>suggested smoothly. “Perhaps something </p><p>else can not wait.” </p><p> “Say, lookit here!” The stranger was</p><p>becoming annoyed. </p><p> “I think that a woman needs the help of</p><p>a man,” said Sing Luey quietly, ignoring </p><p>the other’s ire. “The woman that arrived </p><p>by stage last night,” he continued, speaking </p><p>rapidly. “Mr. Stute has her in the dance- </p><p>hall.” </p><p> “Them nuts shore can wait,” observed</p><p>the stranger, and departed in haste. </p><p> The stranger walked quickly through the</p><p>dance-hall doorway. The girl and Mr. </p><p>Stute were the sole occupants of the large </p><p>front room. Even the bartender was </p><p>absent from his post. Mr. Stute seemed </p><p>annoyed at the stranger’s entry. He </p><p>glanced sharply at the intruder. Then, </p><p>as if by an afterthought, smiled slightly </p><p>and nodded to him. The stranger went </p><p>to the bar. Mr. Stute continued his con- </p><p>versation with the girl. </p><p> “You say you can play the piano,” said</p><p>Mr. Stute. “Fine. I’ve ordered one. </p><p>Ordered it a month ago. It should be </p><p>High Pockets </p><p>9 </p><p>here today or tomorrow. I didn’t know </p><p>what to do for a pianist. Here you arrive, </p><p>you are one, and you need work. It is </p><p>Providential, nothing less than that. It’ll </p><p>be easy work, only four hours a night, and </p><p>I’ll pay forty a week. Forty dollars a week </p><p>for only twenty-eight hours work. I’ve a </p><p>fine place here. You’ll find my—er— </p><p>employees nice, congenial people, and I’ll </p><p>look out for you myself and see that you’re </p><p>happy and contented. I really wish to </p><p>help you all I can, madam. What do you </p><p>say?” </p><p> “She says she’d like to see the bill o’</p><p>ladin’ for that piano first,” the stranger </p><p>answered for her. </p><p> “Wha-what do you mean?” Mr. Stute,</p><p>caught off guard for once in his life, could </p><p>not help but stutter. </p><p> “Figure it out,” said the stranger.</p><p> Mr. Stute stepped in front of the girl.</p><p>She stood back, eying the stranger un- </p><p>certainly. </p><p> “What are you trying to do?” demanded</p><p>Mr. Stute. </p><p> The stranger, leaning against the bar,</p><p>had hooked his right thumb in the armhole </p><p>of his vest. His left hand was close to the </p><p>waistband of his trousers. </p><p> “If yo’re gonna take a chance, get out o’</p><p>line with the lady,” advised the stranger </p><p>pleasantly. </p><p> “I never take chances,” replied Mr.</p><p>Stute. </p><p> “So I’ve heard.” Thus the stranger</p><p>easily. </p><p> “I don’t intend to now.”</p><p> “That’s real bright o’ yuh. Alla same,</p><p>s’pose yuh move a yard to yore left. It’ll </p><p>be more friendly.” </p><p> Mr. Stute hesitated. Then he laughed</p><p>hardily and moved the required yard. </p><p> “Ma’am,” said the stranger, without</p><p>removing his eye from Mr. Stute, “yuh </p><p>wouldn’t wanna job in this shack. It ain’t </p><p>no place for a lady, not nohow. Stute was </p><p>funnin’ yuh, I guess. Wasn’t yuh, Mister </p><p>Stute?” </p><p> “Why, see here—” began Mr. Stute.</p><p> “Just say yes,” interrupted the stranger.</p><p> Again Mr. Stute hesitated.</p><p> “I can see what yo’re thinkin’,” said the</p><p>stranger. “Don’t gamble with me. I don’t </p><p>feel like gamblin’. Not today. Talk </p><p>quick.” </p><p> The pupils of the washed-out gray eyes</p><p>were narrowed to pin-points. Mr. Stute </p><p>turned to the girl. She had shrunk back </p><p>against the wall. She looked frightened to </p><p>death. </p><p> “This gentleman seems to be a friend of</p><p>yours,” said Mr. Stute. “He apparently </p><p>speaks with authority. I will not question </p><p>his right now. At a more favorable time, </p><p>perhaps. I regret to say, madam, that my </p><p>offer is no longer open.” Mr. Stute turned </p><p>from the girl and added, looking sidewise </p><p>at the stranger, “The audience will please </p><p>pass out quietly.” </p><p> “It will,” indorsed the stranger. “Both</p><p>of it. After you, ma’am.” </p><p> The girl went out silently, her hands</p><p>twisted together in front of her. The </p><p>stranger oozed backward through the door- </p><p>way. On the sidewalk he paused and </p><p>addressed the immobile Mr. Stute. </p><p> “I’m glad you listened to reason,” he</p><p>said. </p><p> “Keep feeling that way as long as you</p><p>can,” Mr. Stute tossed back. </p><p> The stranger grinned and nodded, and</p><p>hurried to overtake the girl. When he </p><p>reached her side she looked up into his face. </p><p>Her eyes were shining with unshed tears. </p><p>Her upper lip was caught between her </p><p>teeth. </p><p> “Will yuh gimme a chance to explain?”</p><p>the stranger begged earnestly. </p><p> Pitifully she nodded.</p><p> “ ’Tsall right then. They’s a place out</p><p>back o’ Lainey’s corral where we can sit on </p><p>a old wagon-box an’ be right private. Le’s </p><p>go there.” </p><p>CHAPTER III </p><p> '•	SING LUEY</p><p>THE stranger was not an adept at ex- </p><p>planations—especially an explanation </p><p>of this character to a woman of this class. </p><p>But he did the best he knew and did it </p><p>well. The girl kept silence while he spoke, </p><p>her eyes on his face. When he finished she </p><p>said in a low tone: </p><p> “I’ve heard of dance-halls, of course,</p><p>but I never thought they could be so very </p><p>dreadful if—if a girl was careful. I guess </p><p>I didn’t know. He seemed very kind.” </p><p>“Gents like that are—for a while. Take </p><p>my word for it, ma’am, he’s a snake. An’ </p><p>he don’t rattle.” </p><p> “I don’t know what to do. I must—</p><p>must do something.” </p><p>10 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Was that terrormingled with the sadness</p><p>in her eyes? The stranger could not be </p><p>certain. </p><p> “Don’t yuh know nobody yuh can go to?”</p><p>he asked gently. </p><p> She shook her head, and looked down at</p><p>the hands lying idly in her lap. The </p><p>stranger pushed back his hat and raised </p><p>perplexed eyes to the sky. Here was a </p><p>pleasant problem. </p><p> “I’m a stranger here like you,” he said</p><p>at last. “But I’ll get yuh a job or break a </p><p>leg. That is, if yo’re shore yuh want to </p><p>stay here.” </p><p> “I’ll have to stay here,” she said dully.</p><p>“I mean this place is as good as any.” </p><p> She glanced at him apprehensively.</p><p> He nodded reassuringly.</p><p> “Yuh mustn’t be afraid,” he told her.</p><p>“Nobody won’t bother yuh no more. I’ll </p><p>fix that.” </p><p>“I’m not afraid.” She smiled wanly. </p><p>“That’s right. Don’tcha worry now. </p><p>Everythin’s gonna turn out fine as frawg’s </p><p>hair in August, an’ that’s average fine,” he </p><p>added whimsically. </p><p> She smiled at him again, but the smile</p><p>faded quickly. She shivered a little, and it </p><p>was a hot day. </p><p> “I don’t know your name,” said she</p><p>shyly. </p><p> “Henderson — Bill Henderson’s my</p><p>name.” </p><p> “Mine is Joy Blythe.”</p><p> “That’s shore a right pretty name.</p><p>Sounds kind o’ happy-like.” </p><p> “Does it?”</p><p> “Shore does. Now lookit here, Miss</p><p>Blythe. I’d go into the hotel if I was you </p><p>an’ sort o’ stay there. Me, I’m gonna</p><p>frisk ’round an’ rustle you a real job.” </p><p>“You’re very good.” </p><p> Which remark struck Mr. Henderson</p><p>speechless and made him all warm within. </p><p>He walked awkwardly at her side to the </p><p>door of the hotel, and stood in silence as </p><p>she went in. When he heard the door </p><p>of her room close he sought out Bill Lainey </p><p>who was dolefully peeling potatoes under </p><p>the kitchen window. </p><p> “The wife’s ailin’ today,” said Bill</p><p>apologetically, “an’ I gotta help her out. </p><p>An’ I’m needin’ sleep bad. I always sleep </p><p>in the mornin’s. Can’t seem to get enough </p><p>at night. Runnin’ a hotel is shore work.” </p><p>“Ain’t it a fright,” assented Henderson </p><p>and lowered his voice. “The li’l lady </p><p>inside is a friend o’ mine, an’ I’d take it </p><p>as a personal favor if yuh’d keep an eye </p><p>skinned for her. Kind o’ lookout her </p><p>game when I ain’t ’round an’ lemme know </p><p>if any jigger bothers her. I ain’t aimin’ </p><p>to have her bothered.” </p><p> “That Tom Stute,” observed Mr. Lainey,</p><p>and spat upon the ground significantly. </p><p> “He won’t bother her.”</p><p> “Oh,” said Mr. Lainey and looked wise.</p><p>“I want for her to keep on livin’ in that </p><p>room o’ hers as long as she likes—at four- </p><p>bits a day.” </p><p> “Tom Stute was gonna pay the differ-</p><p>ence.” </p><p>“I’m payin’ the difference, see? An’ </p><p>don’t you never let her find it out neither.” </p><p>“I won’t,” Lainey assured him hastily. </p><p>“The difference’ll be a dollar four-bits.” </p><p>“Here’s forty-five wheels. When that’s </p><p>gone lemme know. Maybe now I won’t be </p><p>in town on the dot, but I’ll be ’round later </p><p>all right, an’ I’m expectin’ to find her here.” </p><p>“She’ll be here,” said Mr. Lainey, and </p><p>dropped the gold pieces chinkingly into his </p><p>pockets. </p><p> Mr. Henderson nodded, pulled his hat</p><p>straight, and set about winning that job. </p><p> His opening move was rather odd. He</p><p>did not return to the street. Instead he </p><p>walked along the haphazard rears of the</p><p>buildings fronting on the thoroughfare. </p><p>He kept his shoulder to the wall as much as </p><p>possible. His manner was wary. </p><p> Near the collection of cribs at the back</p><p>of the dance-hall he paused. From the </p><p>cribs drifted the sound of feminine voices </p><p>wrangling drearily one with another. Hen- </p><p>derson turned at right angles to his former </p><p>course and slid into the narrow space </p><p>between the side wall of the Dewdrop and </p><p>Dolan’s warehouse. He ducked beneath </p><p>the windows till he reached the one nearest </p><p>the street. </p><p> Beneath this window he halted and, bent</p><p>double, affected to fasten a spur. This </p><p>for the benefit of any one passing in the </p><p>street. Within the dance-hall he heard </p><p>the voices of Mr. Stute and his bartender. </p><p>Mr. Stute was damning the world in general </p><p>and a certain man in particular. The </p><p>bartender was indorsing every word with </p><p>the utmost heartiness. </p><p> “Guess they’s only the two of ’em,”</p><p>hazarded Henderson. </p><p> He felt of his weapons, dodged ’round the</p><p>corner of the dance-hall and entered by </p><p>High Pockets </p><p>n </p><p>■way of the front door. Mr. Stute and the </p><p>bartender were alone in the room. They </p><p>made no movement. For Henderson had </p><p>Jerked the gun on his leg, and a remarkably </p><p>cold and washed-out gray eye was glinting </p><p>at them along the sights. </p><p> “You said somethin’ about the audience</p><p>passin’ out quietly a while ago,” observed </p><p>Mr. Henderson. “S’pose you be the audi- </p><p>ence now an’ pass out like you said after me. </p><p>I don’t mean you, barkeep. Just you </p><p>stand right still, an’ keep yore hands flat </p><p>on the bar. That’s right. Come along, </p><p>Stute.” </p><p> He backed streetward. Mr. Stute, hands</p><p>held level with his shoulders, followed as </p><p>if hypnotized. Henderson tolled Mr. Stute </p><p>along the sidewalk to Dolan’s warehouse </p><p>in front of which he halted. </p><p> “Now you an’ me can have a talk,” Mr.</p><p>Henderson said genially. </p><p> “You have the drop,” fretted Mr. Stute.</p><p> “Yuh noticed it?” grinned Mr. Hender-</p><p>son. “Yuh wasn’t expectin’ me quite so </p><p>soon, huh? I just guessed I’d sift in an’ </p><p>see was yuh holdin’ any hard feelin’s.” </p><p> “All I want is an even break,” snapped</p><p>Mr. Stute. </p><p> “Yuh got it, feller.” Henderson slipped</p><p>the six-shooter into its holster. </p><p>WHICH was enough to satisfy the </p><p>most exacting of persons. It satis- </p><p>fied Mr. Stute. His hand streaked </p><p>to the gun-butt under his coat. Hen- </p><p>derson’s left hand moved slightly. His </p><p>vest flew open. There was a spitting flash </p><p>and a bang, and Mr. Stute, his undis- </p><p>charged weapon shot out of his fingers, </p><p>staggered sidewise to the warehouse wall, </p><p>holding a numbed forearm. Mr. Hen- </p><p>derson gazed upon Mr. Stute with interest. </p><p> “The hand is quicker than the eye,”</p><p>said Mr. Henderson succinctly. “An’ that’s </p><p>somethin’ else yuh’ve learned today.” </p><p>He stepped close in to Mr. Stute and stared </p><p>into that temporarily subdued person’s</p><p>close-set eyes. “The li’l lady at Lainey’s </p><p>ain’t to be bothered, Stute,” he continued </p><p>in a harsh whisper. “Walk ’round her. </p><p>Walk way ’round her. The next time it </p><p>might not be yore gun.” </p><p> Came then the marshal, red-faced and</p><p>out of breath. </p><p> “What’s the matter?” he demanded.</p><p> Mr. Henderson surveyed the officer</p><p>frostily. </p><p> “I don’t see nothin’ the matter,” said he.</p><p>“Do you?” </p><p> The marshal, a man of small force,</p><p>glanced uncertainly from Henderson to </p><p>Mr. Stute and back to Henderson. </p><p> “This here gun-play—” began the</p><p>marshal. </p><p> “Was an even break,” interrupted</p><p>Mr. Henderson smoothly. “Stute ain’t </p><p>scratched. If he takes care of his health </p><p>he’d ought to five a long while an’ get fat </p><p>an’ sassy like the rest of us. Yo’re late, </p><p>Marshal. Right now I’ve got business.” </p><p>He turned his back on Mr. Stute and </p><p>the marshal and diagonalled across the </p><p>street to the Happy Heart Saloon. The </p><p>score or more witnesses of the foregoing </p><p>issue at arms relaxed their tense attitudes. </p><p> Windy Taylor jingled a spurred heel and</p><p>spoke out of the corner of his mouth to </p><p>the Kid’s Twin, a Bar S puncher. </p><p> “It don’t seem possible, do it, Twin?”</p><p>The Kid’s Twin smiled and licked his </p><p>lips cat-fashion before replying— </p><p> “Yuh can gamble Stute thinks it do.”</p><p> Windy wagged his head.</p><p> “Tom is reckoned some swift on the</p><p>draw,” said he. </p><p> “He was,” corrected the Kid’s Twin.</p><p> In the Happy Heart Saloon, Henderson,</p><p>sitting at the table farthest from the door, </p><p>wrestled with his problem over a small </p><p>drink. Customers, most of them, looked </p><p>upon him with friendly eyes. A few, these </p><p>boon-companions of Mr. Stute, eyed him</p><p>askance. He, a stranger, had shattered </p><p>their idol. None, however, offered to take </p><p>up the dance-hall person’s quarrel. They </p><p>wondered what Henderson was thinking </p><p>about. He' seemed so completely en- </p><p>grossed in his thoughts. Sat and stared </p><p>at his liquor without drinking it. Which </p><p>was unnatural. </p><p> “Maybe he’s thinkin’ about what Tom’ll</p><p>do to him,” hazarded Ben Skeel, one of Mr. </p><p>Simms’ dealers, to his employer. </p><p> Longhorn Simms laughed sarcastically</p><p>and lit a long cigar. </p><p> “Yo’re a kid, Ben,” said Mr. Simms.</p><p>“High Pockets ain’t the kind to waste his </p><p>time.” </p><p> “Djuh know him?”</p><p> “Not me. Never seen him before in my</p><p>life. But I got eyes, an’ I know a real </p><p>shore-enough stingin’ lizard when I see </p><p>him. Them kind don’t worry about no </p><p>future—not till she comes. An’ I dunno </p><p>12 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>as they worry much then,” Mr. Simms </p><p>added critically. </p><p> Came noon and the habitues of the place</p><p>departed to eat. Henderson remained </p><p>where he was. He had arrived at no </p><p>solution yet. An hour later he raked up </p><p>an idea. From the idea he evolved a plan, </p><p>an amazingly simple plan. He arose, </p><p>leaving his untouched drink on the table, </p><p>and went to the Canton for dinner. </p><p> The few guests had finished and gone</p><p>when he entered. A small, fat Chinaman </p><p>was taking up the used dishes and cutlery. </p><p>Sing Luey sucked his pipe by the window. </p><p>Henderson sat down and gave his order. </p><p>The fat Chinaman went into the kitchen. </p><p>Sing Luey padded across to Henderson’s </p><p>table. Henderson nodded. Sing Luey </p><p>smiled till his eyes closed. </p><p> “The night air,” observed Sing Luey,</p><p>opening his eyes with a suddenness that </p><p>was startling, “is apt to be unhealthy in </p><p>Farewell.” </p><p> “Yeah?”</p><p> “Unless one has eyes in the back of one’s</p><p>head.” </p><p> “My idea exactly,” said Mr. Henderson</p><p>solemnly. “Me, I got lots o’ eyes.” </p><p> “I am glad.” Thus, simply, Sing Luey,</p><p>and returned to his post at the window. </p><p> Henderson ate his steak and potatoes</p><p>and found both excellently American. The </p><p>coffee was above par. It was ranch-cook </p><p>coffee, and every one knows what that </p><p>means. Henderson was pleasantly sur- </p><p>prised. He said as much to Sing Luey </p><p>when he paid the bill. </p><p> “We strive to please,” beamed Sing Luey.</p><p> “Yuh done me a man’s-size favor this</p><p>mornin’,” said Henderson. “I ain’t for- </p><p>gettin’.” </p><p> “Don’t mention it,” deprecated Sing</p><p>Luey. </p><p> “Yuh must ’a’ been kind o’ watchin’ a</p><p>certain game almighty close,” Henderson </p><p>drawled curiously. </p><p> “The methods of the gentleman opposite</p><p>have never been to my liking.” Sing Luey </p><p>was not smiling now. </p><p> “I see,” said Henderson, who didn’t</p><p>quite. “Ever see me before?” </p><p> “Once or twice.”</p><p> “Where?”</p><p> “Seymour City.”</p><p> “Know the Cross T an’ Slash F outfits</p><p>south of Seymour?” </p><p> “I was cook at the Cross T ranch-house</p><p>for three months, a year and a half ago.” </p><p>“Then I’ve heard o’ yuh. Yuh shore </p><p>put cookin’ on the map in that ranch-house. </p><p>Yore name wasn’t Sing Luey down there.” </p><p>“Names are inconvenient at times,” </p><p>smiled the Celestial. </p><p> “Yeah,” drawled the other. “My name’s</p><p>Bill Henderson ’round here.” </p><p> “Of course,” nodded Sing Luey.</p><p> “I guess maybe we understand each</p><p>other.” </p><p> “Surely.”</p><p> Mr. Henderson appeared to ponder a</p><p>moment. </p><p> “So that’s why yuh picked me out?” he</p><p>said suddenly. </p><p> “Yes,” replied Sing Luey. “I knew that</p><p>not a man in town would care to cross the </p><p>gentleman opposite. But a stranger, one </p><p>who did not know him, might possibly run </p><p>the risk. I have been watching you since </p><p>your arrival in Farewell. I saw you look </p><p>at the young lady. It seemed to me that </p><p>you were promising.” </p><p> “Tha-nks,” drawled Henderson, not in</p><p>the least put out by the Chinaman’s frank </p><p>statement. “I’m shore obliged a lot, an’ </p><p>I’m free to admit I like yore style.”</p><p> He surveyed the Celestial a moment,</p><p>keen speculation in his gray eyes. Then </p><p>he made his decision. He resolved to trust </p><p>Sing Luey. Why not? He must trust </p><p>somebody, and Sing Luey had made it </p><p>exceedingly manifest that he could be </p><p>trusted. </p><p> “I guess yuh know the fellers in the town</p><p>pretty well, huh?” questioned Henderson. </p><p>“I have lived here eight months.” </p><p> “Long enough. They’s three stores here</p><p>—Calloway’s, Dolan’s, an’ the Blue Pigeon. </p><p>Calloway, Dolan, an’ the Blue Pigeon </p><p>feller—will they stand the acid?” </p><p> “I’ve heard that Calloway agrees to</p><p>everything one says.” </p><p> “That leaves Dolan an’ the other jigger.</p><p>What about them?” </p><p> “They can not be walked over.”</p><p> “Can’t be rode, huh? That’s good</p><p>bearin’. Do they get drunk a lot, go </p><p>hellin’ ’round—the like o’ that?” </p><p> “Dolan is a man of regular habit—drunk</p><p>on Mondays, always. Cruel to his horses, </p><p>too.” </p><p> “Cross out Mister Dolan. Blue Pigeon’s</p><p>the only card left to draw to. Any bad </p><p>wrinkles?” </p><p> “Mister Mike Flynn, the owner of the</p><p>High Pockets </p><p>13 </p><p>Blue Pigeon Store, is a man of his word. </p><p>He is never known to drink. His heart </p><p>is as big as himself. To tell you the truth, </p><p>had you failed this morning, I should have </p><p>explained matters to Mister Flynn, </p><p>although he is abominably slow on the </p><p>draw. He prefers a shotgun.” </p><p> “I guess maybe Mister Flynn has his</p><p>points. A shotgun ain’t to be sneezed at. </p><p>Can he keep his mouth shut?” </p><p> “Like a Chinaman.”</p><p> Henderson nodded and turned to go.</p><p> “I’ll be seein’ yuh again,” he added over</p><p>his shoulder. </p><p>NO ONE was visible when Hen- </p><p>derson entered the Blue Pigeon </p><p>Store, but a scrabbling noise behind </p><p>and underneath the counter betokened the </p><p>presence of the proprietor. </p><p> “I’ll be topside one-time, whoever yuh</p><p>are,” grunted a muffled voice. “Me pipe’s </p><p>fell through a knot-hole, an’ I’m sweepin’ </p><p>for the-thing.” </p><p> “No hurry,” said Henderson, and looked</p><p>about him. </p><p> Neatness is not the rule in the average</p><p>store on the Western frontier. But the </p><p>Blue Pigeon was marvelously clean and </p><p>tidy. A wide counter bordered two sides </p><p>and the back of the store proper. Behind </p><p>the counter tiers of packed shelves lined </p><p>the walls from floor to ceiling. Between </p><p>the counter and the shelves knotted ropes, </p><p>at intervals of a yard, depended from the </p><p>rafters. Above the canvas-curtained door- </p><p>way at the rear hung a beautifully-made </p><p>model of a black-hulled slim-sparred </p><p>clipper. </p><p> A gurgle of triumph from behind the</p><p>counter, a thump and a scrape, and the </p><p>proprietor bobbed into sight with the sud- </p><p>denness of a Jack-in-the-box. He was </p><p>fondling with stumpy broad fingers a short </p><p>and shiny clay. </p><p> “I’d not have lost this for a lot,” declared</p><p>Mike Flynn. “Not if I had to shift the </p><p>shack to get it. An’ what can I do for </p><p>yuh?” </p><p> He tucked the pipe tenderly into the</p><p>breast pocket of his blue flannel shirt and </p><p>rested both hamlike hands palms down on </p><p>the counter. A wide, heavy-shouldered </p><p>citizen was Mike Flynn, with a red bullet- </p><p>head, a chest like a barrel and thick, </p><p>muscular arms. His sleeves were stagged </p><p>off at the elbows. Long-tailed dragons and </p><p>geishas, both beasts and ladies in four </p><p>colors, were tattooed on those corded fore- </p><p>arms in the best Japanese fashion. An </p><p>open-mouthed tiger’s head gaped upon the </p><p>back of each hand. </p><p> “Kind o’ fancy, ain’t they?” Mike</p><p>Flynn remarked with pride, noting the </p><p>direction of Henderson’s glance. “Cost </p><p>me four months’ pay in Yokohama. An’ </p><p>what is it yuh want?” </p><p> “My name’s Henderson, an’ I got a</p><p>proposition,” was the answer. </p><p>“If it’s mines I ain’t buyin’ a share,” </p><p>Mike averred hastily. “Cattle likewise.” </p><p>The keen blue eyes beneath the red- </p><p>thatched brows gazed suspiciously upon </p><p>Mr. Henderson. The latter laughed. </p><p> “Nothin’ like that,” Henderson assured</p><p>the other. “This here proposition is to help </p><p>a lady.” </p><p> “Huh?” Doubtfully.</p><p> “Djuh see the li’l lady that arrove in the</p><p>stage yest’day?” </p><p> “Shore.”</p><p> “She needs a job bad. She’s gotta have</p><p>one. No two ways about that. Tom Stute </p><p>offered her work.” </p><p> “The----!” Regarding</p><p>his opinion of the dance-hall proprietor </p><p>Mike Flynn left nothing to the imagination. </p><p> “He’s worse’n that,” concurred Hen-</p><p>derson. “He took back his offer later.” </p><p>Mike Flynn’s eyes grew bright with</p><p>interest. </p><p> “I wasn’t out in the street this mornin’,”</p><p>said he, “but I heard somethin’ about Stute </p><p>havin’ a fraycas wit’ a stranger. An’ yo’re </p><p>him?” </p><p> “I had a li’l talk with Stute,” Henderson</p><p>admitted with becoming modesty. </p><p> “Shake!” cried Mike Flynn heartily, and</p><p>clamped hands with Henderson. “There’d </p><p>be no grief if yuh’d killed him, the scut. </p><p>Why didn’t yuh?” </p><p> “Not necessary—yet,” said Henderson,</p><p>sliding his right hand behind his back and </p><p>wiggling the fingers rapidly, for all feeling </p><p>had quite gone out of them. </p><p> “It will be necessary, I’m thinkin’.”</p><p>Earnestly. </p><p> “Maybe. We’ll see. About the li’l lady’s</p><p>job now. I figure the Blue Pigeon is the </p><p>best place in town for her to work. You </p><p>can sort o’ lookout her game when I ain’t </p><p>’round. She’ll bring trade, you can gam- </p><p>ble, an’ her wages’ll be fifteen a week, me </p><p>payin’ the fifteen.” </p><p>14 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Yuh’ll not,” Mike Flynn asserted with</p><p>emphasis. “I’ve got a fine trade here. </p><p>I’m puttin’ money away, an’ for what </p><p>I dunno. I’ve no kin in this world, God </p><p>rest them. You pay half. I’ll pay the </p><p>other half.” </p><p> “Whadda yuh say to twenty then? A</p><p>eagle a week apiece.” </p><p> “Spoke handsome. I knowed you an’</p><p>me’d hit it off first crack.” </p><p> “She mustn’t ever find out the true</p><p>insides o’ that twenty.” </p><p> “She’ll not. Don’t fret. Tongues’ll wag</p><p>when ’tis known Mike Flynn’s hired a </p><p>helper, but I got a tongue too, an’ I can </p><p>use that same or anythin’ else nadeful. </p><p>An’ what might be the young lady’s name? </p><p>Joy Blythe! ’Tis a name the good people </p><p>might ’a’ gave her. There’s luck in it for </p><p>shore an’ certain.” </p><p>CHAPTER IV </p><p>THE RAINBOW </p><p>t'OX-TROTTING into town from the </p><p>south, as Henderson crossed the </p><p>street to Lainey’s Hotel, came a rider on a </p><p>rangy red horse. Catching sight of Hender- </p><p>son, the rider uttered a shrill whoop and </p><p>spurred her mount. Henderson wheeled </p><p>in a flash. The red horse, hard held, slid </p><p>to a halt at his side. The rider, a young </p><p>girl, leaned from the saddle and held out a </p><p>gloveless hand. </p><p> “An’ how’s Mister—” she began.</p><p>“Henderson!” whispered the man hur- </p><p>riedly, and vigorously squeezed the proffered </p><p>fingers. </p><p> “Why, of course,” laughed the girl.</p><p>“How stupid of me not to remember. </p><p>How’re tricks?” </p><p> She clasped hands on her saddle-horn and</p><p>surveyed him, a laughing devil in her black </p><p>eyes. </p><p> “Cornin’ in bunches,” he told her, and</p><p>dropped his left eyelid.</p><p> “Naughty, naughty,” she laughed, and</p><p>winked back. “The pitcher will go to the </p><p>well once too many one of these days.” </p><p>“Not while I have my health.” </p><p> “And your assurance. Busy?”</p><p> “Some.”</p><p> “Meaning a lot. -it. I’ve been in</p><p>my uncle’s Lazy River camp for a month, </p><p>and I yearn for conversation other than </p><p>that of my relatives.” </p><p> “I tell yuh, Miss Rainbow, if I could whirl</p><p>the dictionary ’round my head like that I’d </p><p>be satisfied to talk to myself.” </p><p> The Rainbow threw him a charming</p><p>smile in payment and fished in her breast </p><p>pocket for the makings. She was the half- </p><p>breed niece of that well-known and greatly </p><p>respected Indian, Willie’s Old Brother-in- </p><p>Law, and she was a very handsome girl. </p><p>Her complexion was no darker than that of </p><p>the average brunette, her figure would have </p><p>delighted a modiste, and she had spent six </p><p>years in a convent. The racial stoicism and </p><p>sullenness, among other attributes, were not </p><p>present in the Rainbow’s make-up. She </p><p>never acted like a true Indian. In her </p><p>language she was as unrestrained as in her </p><p>life. It must not be supposed that she was </p><p>not a good girl. She was good in all that </p><p>the adjective implies, as more than one </p><p>philandering puncher had discovered to his </p><p>sorrowful surprise and bodily pain. </p><p> “Got a match?” she asked.</p><p> He pulled one from his hatband. She</p><p>lit her cigaret and blew a luxurious ring. </p><p>It speaks well for her beauty that she could </p><p>blow rings and look attractive without the </p><p>least difficulty. He watched her admiringly. </p><p> “Tell yuh what,” he said, struck by an</p><p>idea; “if yuh wanna talk real bad come </p><p>over to Lainey’s with me. They’s a li’l lady </p><p>there—a stranger, an’ she’s lonesome an’ </p><p>scared an’ needs cheerin’ up.” </p><p> “A girl!” exclaimed the Rainbow ecstat-</p><p>ically. “My age?” </p><p> “Just about.”</p><p> “Scared, you said. Of what?” The</p><p>Rainbow’s brows drew together. </p><p> “I dunno. Yuh needn’t look at me so</p><p>cross. I didn’t scare her.” </p><p> “Who did?”</p><p> “I dunno that neither. She looked</p><p>scared when she come in the stage yest’day. </p><p>You go in an’ talk to her, will yuh, Miss </p><p>Rainbow?” </p><p> “Will I? Just watch me. Wait till I</p><p>put Windigo in the corral. No, don’t </p><p>bother. I’ll do it myself. Windy’d bite </p><p>your little ears if you even tried to take off </p><p>his bridle. Wait for me in front.” </p><p> Horse and rider whirled and fled in a</p><p>scurry of pebbles and dust. Henderson </p><p>went to the hotel. Five minutes later, </p><p>stammering in his speech, red as to the face, </p><p>he was presenting the Rainbow to Miss </p><p>Blythe at the door of the latter’s room. </p><p>“Shuh-shake hands with my friend, the </p><p>High Pockets </p><p>15 </p><p>Rainbow—Miss—Miss Rainbow, I mean,” </p><p>was the fashion of the introduction, but it </p><p>sufficed, and Henderson retreated to the </p><p>outer air and the corral. </p><p> He leaned against the bars of the gate and</p><p>slatted his fingers across his damp forehead. </p><p> “-!” he swore. “It ain’t no trouble</p><p>a-tall to talk to one girl by herself, but two </p><p>together is shore a fright!” </p><p> “Yuh look het up,” observed a calm voice</p><p>within a yard of his ear. </p><p> Henderson turned and grinned into the</p><p>face of Chuck Morgan from Soogan Creek. </p><p> “It’s a hot day,” explained Henderson.</p><p> “It ain’t the heat’s makin’ yuh sweat,”</p><p>Chuck contradicted shrewdly. “What was </p><p>yuh mutterin’ about? Somebody glom </p><p>on to yore li’l tin dishes or somethin’?” </p><p> “Howdja like nesterin’?” countered</p><p>Henderson. </p><p> “Nester yoreself,” cried Mr. Morgan</p><p>with spirit, screwing down the top of a </p><p>salve can and sliding the can into a pocket </p><p>of his chaps. “Me, I got forty cows, four </p><p>bulls, an’ twelve calves. I’m gonna put the </p><p>Bar S out o’ business myself, an’ the 88 too </p><p>if I feel like it. Got a real shore-’nough </p><p>brand to play with, li’l Willie has. Yessir, </p><p>any time yuh see a good-lookin’ cow, CY </p><p>left hip, staple fork each ear, don’t yuh go </p><p>fiddlin’ with it none ’cause it’s mine my </p><p>own.” </p><p> “All that?” drawled Henderson, and</p><p>glanced into the corral behind Chuck to </p><p>where a raw-boned gray horse with a salve- </p><p>daubed cut on his shoulder was striving </p><p>vainly to reach his wound with his teeth. </p><p>“Where djuh rustle the accordeen, or did </p><p>yuh find him some’ers livin’ with the other </p><p>coyotes?” </p><p> He and Mr. Morgan were friends of long</p><p>standing, and could insult each other with </p><p>impunity. </p><p> “Ain’t he a real hoss?” challenged Chuck.</p><p>“Don’t look nothin’ like that yaller lump o’ </p><p>dust a-imitatin’ a three-legged table yonder </p><p>in the corner, does he? Why don’tcha buy </p><p>you a Injun pony, Bill? Yuh’d be sur- </p><p>prised, honest, yuh would.” </p><p> “Speakin’ o’ Bill, Chuck,” the other said</p><p>seriously, “I’d take it as a favor if you’d </p><p>remember the last half o’ that name is </p><p>Henderson.” </p><p> Chuck nodded.</p><p> “I can see,” he announced solemnly,</p><p>“she’s gonna be a wild night on the canal, </p><p>mules pinnin’ back their ears an’ everythin’. </p><p>I hope I ain’t gonna miss nothin’,” he </p><p>added anxiously. </p><p> “Remember yo’re a married man,”</p><p>chided Henderson, “an’ yore place is the </p><p>home.” </p><p> “You talk like a hell-dodger. C’mon back</p><p>to Soogan with me tonight. You ain’t-” </p><p>“I AM,” interrupted Henderson </p><p>and continued in a lower tone: </p><p>“I’m one busy gent. I don’t mind </p><p>tellin’ you somethin’ for yuh to keep under </p><p>yore hat. Maybe yuh can help me. Listen. </p><p>Seven weeks ago Sile Thompson o’ the </p><p>Slash F sent his brother Rufe north to buy </p><p>horses off o’ Scotty Mackenzie up on the </p><p>Dogsoldier. Rufe never reached the Flyin’ </p><p>M. He stopped in Farewell. He’shereyet.” </p><p>Chuck nodded with half-shut eyes. </p><p> “They found him out back o’ the stage</p><p>corrals in the mornin’,” he said slowly. </p><p>“He’d been knifed, an’ he was shore carved. </p><p>Piney Jackson helped bury him, an’ he </p><p>told me.” </p><p> “Cut more’n once, was he?”</p><p> “Y’betcha. His throat was slit half-</p><p>through, an’ his chest looked like it had </p><p>stopped a Greener’s buckshot. But it was </p><p>all knife-work ’ceptin’ his face, an’ that had </p><p>been tramped on. Yessir, Thompson’s </p><p>features had been stomped to a frazzle. </p><p>Whoever done it shore carried a grudge.” </p><p>“Which is my idea—now. Sile thought </p><p>it was just a plain killin’ an’ robbery. Rufe </p><p>was carryin’ three thousand in bills.”</p><p> “In a belt?”</p><p> “In a belt.”</p><p> “I didn’t hear nothin’ about no belt.”</p><p>“They wasn’t none on him when they </p><p>found him. Jake Rule an’ his deputy </p><p>Kansas was the ones found him, an’ they </p><p>said-” </p><p> “Yeah, I know. The sheriff said in a</p><p>letter when he sent Rufe’s horse an’ saddle </p><p>an’ war-bags back to the Slash F they </p><p>wasn’t nothin’ on Rufe but his gun, six- </p><p>bits, his silver watch an’ Sile Thompson’s </p><p>letter to Scotty. Jake sent back every- </p><p>thin’ he found. He was mighty partic’lar </p><p>about it.” </p><p> “Piney told me Rufe hadn’t pulled his</p><p>gun,” observed Chuck. </p><p> “That’s what Jake said. Rufe didn’t get</p><p>no even break, that’s a cinch. An’ a man </p><p>had oughta have a even break.” </p><p> “Seen Jake?”</p><p> “I ain’t gonna see Jake. He ain’t got</p><p>i6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>nothin’ to tell me. Yo’re the only gent </p><p>knows why I’m here, an’ yo’re the only one </p><p>a-goin’ to know—now. Sing Luey’s guessed </p><p>why maybe, but he’s all right.” </p><p> “Sing Luey?”</p><p> “Shore, the Chink runnin’ the Canton.”</p><p>“Them foreigners is bad medicine,” </p><p>Chuck said doubtfully. </p><p> “I’m tellin’ yuh he’s all right. Anyway,</p><p>he can’t be helped. He seen me when he </p><p>was cookin’ for the Cross T, an’ I guess he </p><p>knows as much about me as anybody ’round </p><p>Seymour. Knowin’ that, he’d oughta be </p><p>able to guess the rest.” </p><p> “Shore ought. Well, here’s hopin’. Yuh</p><p>got you a real two-legged job, Bill.” </p><p> “I’m due to stay a while. Sile said I</p><p>wasn’t to come back till Rufe was paid for, </p><p>not if it took years. Have yuh took root </p><p>in that corral, Chuck, or can you climb over </p><p>them bars? I know where they’s two lone- </p><p>some drinks just a-pinin’ for you an’ me.” </p><p>Chuck Morgan immediately climbed </p><p>over the gate. Ten minutes later they </p><p>parted in front of the Starlight Saloon, </p><p>Chuck to execute his wife’s commissions, </p><p>Henderson to return to his accustomed chair </p><p>flanking the doorway of the hotel. </p><p> From the window of Miss Blythe’s room</p><p>drifted a muffled murmur. Henderson’s </p><p>eye-corners wrinkled with satisfaction. </p><p> “The Rainbow shore is good people,” he</p><p>pronounced to himself, and promptly for- </p><p>got the lady in absorbing deliberation upon </p><p>his immediate business in life. </p><p> Came Chuck Morgan within the hour,</p><p>and sat down beside him on the door sill. </p><p> “When are yuh leavin’ town?” queried</p><p>Chuck. </p><p> “Leavin’ town?” Henderson raised in-</p><p>quiring brows. </p><p> “To save yore life.”</p><p> “Huh?”</p><p> “I hear Tom Stute filled yuh all full o’</p><p>holes,” grinned Chuck. </p><p> “I shore feel like a sieve,” Henderson</p><p>smiled back. </p><p> “She’s a wonder yuh wouldn’t tell a</p><p>man,” complained Chuck. “But not you. </p><p>Anythin’ funny yuh got ta keep to yoreself, </p><p>all same Injun. Some day yo’re a-goin’ to </p><p>make me a heap mad actin’ thataway. </p><p>Why didn’tcha down him?” </p><p> “I missed.

I come an’ go.”</p><p>“You certainly are the most unsatisfac- </p><p>tory person!” The Rainbow began to </p><p>blaze, but the flame died almost instantly, </p><p>and she smiled the smile that ever lurked </p><p>at the corners of her mouth. “I’m glad </p><p>you’re here,” she said. </p><p> “Me? Why?”</p><p> “You’re a handy man to have around.”</p><p>“Oh, shore. Mother’s li’l helper myself. </p><p>Whatcha want, Miss Rainbow?” </p><p> “She told me you were hunting her a job,”</p><p>pursued the Rainbow, heedless of the per- </p><p>siflage. “Did you find one?” </p><p> “Y’betcha. At the Blue Pigeon. Didn’t</p><p>have any trouble a-tall.” </p><p> “As the days flit by, I like you more and</p><p>more,” observed the Rainbow. “Don’t </p><p>blush. This is not an avowal of love. You </p><p>needn’t squirm either. I can’t stand a </p><p>wriggly man. I am merely expressing my </p><p>entire approval of your conduct, old-timer. </p><p>If you hadn’t been here—but you were, so </p><p>I’ll not go into that. Why didn’t you kill </p><p>him?” </p><p> “Stute’s shore got lots o’ friends. Seems</p><p>like everybody’s askin’ me that.” </p><p>“Naturally. You’ll have the job to do </p><p>again, of course. However—you talk to </p><p>Joy all you can, old-timer. Keep her from </p><p>getting lonesome. She likes you. Thinks </p><p>you’re just fine.” </p><p> “Huh?”</p><p>High Pockets </p><p>17 </p><p> “Don’t ‘huh’ me, you long-legged heron.</p><p>You heard what I said the first time. You </p><p>see her a lot and be nice to her, or I’ll come </p><p>back and make you hard to find. And— </p><p>and don’t get drunk more’n once a week. </p><p>It’s bad for the liver. Let me see, did I </p><p>forget anything.” She turned about and </p><p>regarded her saddlebags and the bulging </p><p>slicker tied behind the cantle. “Candy and </p><p>jews-harps for the kids,” she rattled on, </p><p>checking off the articles on her fingers, “and </p><p>tobacco and matches, all in the slicker. </p><p> “Auntie Little Deer’s mirror, needles,</p><p>chewing-gum and butcher knife in the off </p><p>war-bag together with my two new' shirts </p><p>and half the cartridges. Auntie Two Cloud’s </p><p>thread, beeswax, tin cup, calico and my </p><p>tooth-brush and the other two bags o’ car- </p><p>tridges in the near. The fish-hooks and </p><p>line in the staple-pocket, and that’s the </p><p>finish. I do hope that mirror rides all right. </p><p>If it doesn’t and it busts it’s seven years </p><p>bad luck for me, and auntie’ll have four- </p><p>teen fits. So long, Mister Henderson. Re- </p><p>member what I’ve told you. Hold still, </p><p>Windy. You aren’t a pinwheel.” </p><p> The Rainbow hopped into the saddle and</p><p>rode off at a lope. She did not look back. </p><p>Henderson went into the hotel and knocked </p><p>at Miss Blythe’s door. A quick clicking of </p><p>high heels within, the door opened, and the </p><p>girl appeared. She smiled at him. There </p><p>was genuine cheer in that smile. Her dark </p><p>eyes had lost a deal of their initial sad- </p><p>ness. </p><p> “About that job,” he began abruptly,</p><p>“I got it. ’Tendin’ store. Twenty dollars </p><p>a week.” </p><p> “Twenty a week!”</p><p> The dark eyes widened saucer-wise.</p><p>“Shore, twenty a week. But if yuh don’t </p><p>think that’s enough I’ll betcha he’d pay </p><p>more. I’ll see him.” </p><p> “Oh, I didn’t mean that!” she cried, in-</p><p>stantly distressed. “I mean it’s a great </p><p>deal more than I expected. I—I’m not </p><p>very experienced. I-” </p><p> “Don’tcha worry, ma’am. Yuh’ll learn</p><p>—fast. I know yuh will. How about </p><p>cornin’ over to the Blue Pigeon—that’s the </p><p>store—an’ havin’ a talk with Mike Flynn. </p><p>He’s the owner, an’ a real gent.” </p><p> “I’d like to. Will I need a hat? Is it</p><p>far?” </p><p> “Nothin’s far in Farewell.. It’s only when</p><p>yo’re ridin’ the range places is far. The </p><p>Blue Pigeon’s right close.” </p><p> They walked across to the Blue Pigeon.</p><p>It was their second walk together, but on </p><p>that first occasion his mental processes had </p><p>moved too swiftly for him to be fully con- </p><p>scious of her slim slightness. At any dis- </p><p>tance Miss Blythe’s almost perfect, propor- </p><p>tions made her seem taller than she actu- </p><p>ally was. But now, with her beside him, </p><p>he saw that she was barely two finger- </p><p>breadths taller than five feet. She was </p><p>wearing high-heeled shoes too. Why, she </p><p>could walk under his arm. Involuntarily </p><p>he hunched a shoulder, and promptly felt </p><p>his face grow hot. Hastily he began to </p><p>comment upon the state of the weather. </p><p> The observant Mr. Simms, holding down</p><p>a cracker-box in front of Dolan’s warehouse </p><p>permitted himself to smile. He was think- </p><p>ing of his bet with Mr. Stute. </p><p> “I guess I win,” said Longhorn Simms to</p><p>himself, and lit a fresh cigar on the strength </p><p>of it. </p><p> Mike Flynn was selling a customer when</p><p>Henderson and the girl entered. The cus- </p><p>tomer, having paid for and received his </p><p>purchase, would have lingered. He had a </p><p>failing for brunettes. But Henderson </p><p>turned a cold eye in his direction, and he </p><p>departed. </p><p> Mike Flynn did not wait to be intro-</p><p>duced. </p><p> “So yo’re Miss Blythe,” he beamed, ex-</p><p>tending a huge and freckled paw. “I’m </p><p>Mike Flynn, an’ I hope yuh’ll like the Blue </p><p>Pigeon.” </p><p> The girl put her hand in his, and looked</p><p>squarely into his honest eyes. </p><p> “I know I will,” said she.</p><p> “An’ that’s as it should be. Praise be,</p><p>we’ll get along fine. Could yuh be cornin’ </p><p>in behind the counter, ma’am?” </p><p> He lifted a hinged flap at the end of the</p><p>counter and beamed anew. </p><p> The girl turned to speak to Henderson.</p><p>But he had gone. </p><p> “I didn’t even thank him!” she exclaimed.</p><p>“What will he think of me?” </p><p> “What’s thanks between friends?” said</p><p>Mike. “But you’ll be seein’ him again, </p><p>don’t fret. Thim ropes wit’ the overhand </p><p>knots now. They’re for me to lay aloft, </p><p>but you’ll not be usin’ thim. I’ll build </p><p>yuh a nate little step-ladder on wheels, so I </p><p>will.” </p><p> He seized one of the dangling ropes and</p><p>went up hand over hand till his head was </p><p>level with the top shelf. “Here, yuh’ll </p><p>Adventure </p><p>take notice,” he continued, holding him- </p><p>self in place with one hand and gesturing </p><p>with the other, “are the tarps an’ the chaps, </p><p>stuff that goes slow, an’ next-” </p><p>FROM the Blue Pigeon Henderson </p><p>went to the corral and caught up </p><p>his horse. He wanted to ride and </p><p>think. He realized that his present job </p><p>was an outlaw in every sense of the word, </p><p>and that he was riding it bareback. But </p><p>he was not in the least daunted. He had </p><p>the happy theoiy that a murderer, no mat- </p><p>ter how cleverly painstaking he may be, </p><p>can not conceal all the evidence of his guilt. </p><p>There is always a clue or two for the open </p><p>mind to perceive. Henderson had never </p><p>yet found cause to dispute this theory. </p><p> It was moon-rise when he returned to</p><p>town and long after the hotel’s regular </p><p>meal-hour. He ate at the Canton, and </p><p>after supper he looked in at the Starlight </p><p>saloon, bought two long cigars, and went on </p><p>to Uie Blue Pigeon. Mike Flynn was clos- </p><p>ing for the night, but he bade Henderson </p><p>enter, and locked the doors and dropped the </p><p>heavy bar. </p><p> “All alone I am, an’ lonesome too,” said</p><p>Mike. “I let the little lady go off watch at </p><p>six, an’ told her she naden’t work avenin’s, </p><p>nor Sundays nayther. A bit o’ sunshine </p><p>she is, the blessed child, but I’m thinkin’ </p><p>it’s April sunshine. There’s sorrow at the </p><p>back o’ thim eyes. A cigar? Thanks, an’ I </p><p>will. Come aft for a mug-up an’ a gam.” </p><p>Henderson did not know what a mug-up </p><p>and a gam might be, but he followed Mike </p><p>into the back room, a room even more </p><p>scrupulously neat and clean than the store. </p><p>From the ceiling a ship’s lamp hung in </p><p>gimbals. Against one wall was a solidly- </p><p>built bunk covered with a blue blanket. </p><p>The other furnishings were sea-chests, two </p><p>chairs, a well-found cupboard and a kitchen </p><p>stove. Mike Flynn thoughtfully drew the </p><p>ship’s curtains that ran on brass rods above </p><p>the windows and proceeded to make cof- </p><p>fee. A mug-up, it appeared when Hender- </p><p>son expressed a polite curiosity, was coffee </p><p>in a tin cup, and a gam was a chat. </p><p>“ ’Tis whaler-talk, that last,” amplified </p><p>Mike. “I was harpooner three voyages in </p><p>the Gleaner out o’ New Bedford. The </p><p>sugar’s at yore elbow, Mister Henderson.”</p><p>“My friends call me Bill.” </p><p> “Mine’s Mike,” grinned the Irishman.</p><p>“Here’s luck.” </p><p> “This town’s no place for a lady,” Hen-</p><p>derson said at random over the coffee. </p><p> “Yo’re right, but the poor innocent says</p><p>she likes it.” </p><p> “Yeah? She’ll change her mind when</p><p>some o’ these rousy jiggers get to hellin’ </p><p>’round. Farewell’s got a rep.” </p><p> “Ain’t it the truth? A killin’ now an’</p><p>then can’t be helped, but I ain’t got no use </p><p>for a murder, not Mike Flynn.” </p><p> “Seems to me I heard they was a party</p><p>rubbed out thataway about three months </p><p>ago.” </p><p> “I was thinkin’ o’ that, but ’twas only</p><p>seven weeks. Rufe Thompson his name </p><p>was, from south o’ Seymour some’ers. As </p><p>fine-lookin’ a young man as yuh’d ever hope </p><p>to see. Bought smokin’ an’ plug o’ me be- </p><p>fore he’d been in town twenty minutes. </p><p>By mornin’ he was shark-bait, poor fellah.” </p><p>“Who killed him?” </p><p> “God knows, an’ no one else. They was</p><p>no evidence to be got, though the sheriff </p><p>an’ his deputy wint sniffin’ hither an’ yon </p><p>for a wake.” </p><p> “Maybe some stranger done it,” Hen-</p><p>derson suggested. </p><p> “He was the only stranger in town.”</p><p> “He might ’a’ had a argument with a</p><p>puncher.” </p><p> “It was not so rayported. Jake Rule</p><p>traced Ms movements, Kansas Casey told </p><p>me, an’ they was few an’ seldom. After </p><p>lavin’ here with his tobaccy he put his hoss </p><p>in the hotel corral. He wint to the Star- </p><p>light an’ had one—two drinks. He done </p><p>the same in the Happy Heart. He ate </p><p>supper at the Canton. He wint back to </p><p>the Happy Heart an’ played black-jack an’ </p><p>the wheel maybe a couple o’ hours. He </p><p>quit sixteen dollars loser, an’ put in the rest </p><p>o’ the time till maybe one o’clock in the </p><p>mornin’ in the dance-hall.</p><p> “He told the barkeep over his last drink,</p><p>at one o’clock or thereabouts like I’m tellin’ </p><p>yuh, he was goin’ to the hotel an’ turn in. </p><p>He left the Dewdrop, but he didn’t reach </p><p>the hotel. For all Jake could find out no- </p><p>body laid eyes on him after he left the dance- </p><p>hall till Jake himself an’ Kansas found him </p><p>stark dead wit’ his gun not pulled out back </p><p>o’ the stage corral in the mornin’.” </p><p> “Maybe he was drunk, this Rufe Thomp-</p><p>son, an’-” </p><p> “Not him. He only had two drinks at</p><p>the dance-hall, an’ four maybe before sup- </p><p>per. Six drinks all told stretched through </p><p>High Pockets </p><p>19 </p><p>eight hours. An’ they was short drinks— </p><p>none of ’em more’n two fingers. ’Twould </p><p>make no man drunk, such wouldn’t.” </p><p>“Well, on a rainy night like thatmost any- </p><p>thin’ could happen an’ not be found out.” </p><p> “ ’Twas not a rainy night. ’Twas a fine</p><p>night wit’ a full moon, I mind that special. </p><p>’Twas over the mast at midnight, the moon </p><p>was, for I wint to bed then, an’ I seen it.” </p><p>“’S funny how with moonlight an’ all </p><p>he didn’t see what was cornin’ an’ go after </p><p>his gun. The ground’s open back o’ them </p><p>corrals. No place for a murderer to hide.” </p><p> “It’s all beyond me, but it’s a-shame,</p><p>I know that. Some more coffee, Bill?” </p><p>CHAPTER VI </p><p>THE WAY OF THE WICKED </p><p>R. HENDERSON elected to leave </p><p>Mike Flynn’s quarters by the back </p><p>way. He stood in the soft darkness of the </p><p>Blue Pigeon’s shadow, his eyes on the </p><p>moon-drenched Happy Heart corral, and </p><p>considered. He had pumped Mike Flynn </p><p>fairly dry. There was another he wished </p><p>to pump—the placid Celestial, Sing Luey. </p><p>“Wished” is used advisedly, for the aver- </p><p>age Chinaman can not be pumped, and Sing </p><p>Luey was above the average. He would </p><p>talk or not, as the spirit moved him. </p><p> In the Happy Heart corral a horse neighed</p><p>shrilly. From the house next door came </p><p>the rising wail of a wakeful baby. A dog </p><p>at the other end of Main Street took excep- </p><p>tion to the moon and began to bark. A </p><p>coyote in the distance yapped steadily. A </p><p>voice at Henderson’s side said— </p><p> “Good evening.”</p><p> Henderson’s nerves were under excellent</p><p>control, but he almost jumped. He wheeled </p><p>and confronted Sing Luey. </p><p> “Why the gun?” questioned Sing Luey</p><p>in a tone of gentle reproof. </p><p> Henderson returned the weapon to the</p><p>waistband of his trousers and smiled</p><p>crookedly. His action had been natural— </p><p>for him. </p><p> “Don’t be so - quiet next time,”</p><p>he whispered. “Y’oughto know better. </p><p>Whadda yuh want?” </p><p> “What do you want?” was the quiet reply.</p><p>“Me?” Henderson’s eyes searched the </p><p>serene features. </p><p> “Of course. Who else? I knew you</p><p>would wish to see me again, and I have been </p><p>sitting under Kennedy’s wagon waiting for </p><p>you to come out. I have waited two </p><p>hours.” </p><p> Henderson glanced at Kennedy’s wagon</p><p>standing some thirty yards to the left. </p><p> “Howdja know I’d come out the back</p><p>way?” he demanded. </p><p> “Simple logic. Mike always bars and</p><p>locks his front door. You and he were in </p><p>the back room. Naturally you would leave </p><p>by the back door.” </p><p> “You must ’a’ been keepin’ cases on me</p><p>mighty close,” Henderson said crossly. </p><p> “I knew you wished to see me. It may</p><p>be that I wished to see you.” </p><p> “Le’s go where we can talk.” Abruptly.</p><p> “My house is at your disposal,” suggested</p><p>Sing Luey suavely. </p><p> Together, the white man and the yellow,</p><p>they catfooted through the shadows to the </p><p>rear of the Canton. Henderson was more </p><p>than a thought uncomfortable. Hell's bells, </p><p>the Chink was a mind-reader. </p><p> Sing Luey turned the wooden knob of the</p><p>Canton’s back door. The door swung on its </p><p>hinges without a sound. </p><p> “Wait,” said Sing Luey. “I will make a</p><p>light.” </p><p> Henderson heard him padding about in-</p><p>side. A match scratched and flared. Sing </p><p>Luey lit a lamp and beckoned. Henderson </p><p>obeyed and closed the door behind him. He</p><p>was in the kitchen of the Canton. In a </p><p>room at the right some one was snoring. </p><p> “My cook sleeps with enjoyment,” ob-</p><p>served Sing Luey, and led the way through </p><p>a narrow passage to a closed door. He un- </p><p>locked this door, thrust it open, and en- </p><p>tered the room beyond. Henderson fol- </p><p>lowed. Sing Luey set the lamp on a table, </p><p>turned the key in the door-lock, and </p><p>dropped a heavy piece of tapestry across </p><p>the door. </p><p> Henderson’s eyes ranged the room. His</p><p>nostrils sniffed the incense-laden air. The </p><p>bronze Buddha on its jade stand, the tiny </p><p>altar where joss-sticks glowed, intrigued </p><p>him. The gorgeous China silk hangings </p><p>concealing the walls and windows, the </p><p>ancient leather-bound books that heaped </p><p>one-half the table, filled him with wonder. </p><p>He had never seen such things before. </p><p> And Sing Luey had once cooked for the</p><p>Gross T! He looked at Sing Luey. The </p><p>Chinaman smiled his balmy smile and indi- </p><p>cated the chair beside the table with a </p><p>swing of his hand. </p><p>20 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Be pleased to sit,” invited Sing Luey.</p><p>“I will lie upon the bed.” </p><p> The Chinaman waited with meticulous</p><p>politeness till his guest was seated, then </p><p>dropped his long body sidewise upon the </p><p>narrow bed beyond the Buddha and sup- </p><p>ported his head on one hand. </p><p> “Kong-Fu-Tse writes,” said he, pro-</p><p>nouncing the eminent philosopher’s name </p><p>in the Chinese fashion, “that nothing is </p><p>hidden. What the eye does not perceive, </p><p>the mind may fathom. That is logic.” </p><p>Henderson tilted his hat and rubbed an </p><p>ear. </p><p> “I dunno yore friend—” he began</p><p>haltingly. </p><p> “He has been dead more than two thou-</p><p>sand years.” </p><p> “Yeah? Well, anyway, he knowed what</p><p>he was talkin’ about. Some o’ them old- </p><p>timers was right wise. I wonder now was </p><p>Kung—Kung-Foo-Soo—alive this minute </p><p>what he’d say about a murder that hap- </p><p>pened here in Farewell about seven weeks </p><p>ago.” </p><p> “He would take thought certainly,” ad-</p><p>mitted Sing Luey inscrutably. </p><p>“He’d have to have somethin’ to go on.” </p><p>“He would discover that something.” </p><p>“There ain’t no evidence, so far as I can </p><p>find out, that anybody seen Rufe Thomp- </p><p>son—might as well be open with yuh, I ex- </p><p>pect—from the time he left the dance-hall </p><p>till Jake Rule found him in the mornin’.” </p><p>“It was bright moonlight that night,” </p><p>observed Sing Luey. </p><p> Henderson nodded. He no longer felt</p><p>uncomfortable in the presence of Sing Luey. </p><p>A warm liking for the Chinaman grew apace. </p><p> “It should have been an easy matter,”</p><p>went on Sing Luey, “to watch the move- </p><p>ments of Mister Thompson—had any one </p><p>taken the trouble.” </p><p> “No one did.”</p><p> “I did.”</p><p> Henderson received the declaration</p><p>coolly. </p><p> “You would,” he remarked. “Tell it.”</p><p>“Mister Thompson ate supper here that </p><p>night. D uring the meal he told Piney Jack- </p><p>son he was going to the Flying M to buy </p><p>horses. I heard him, so did ten other men. </p><p>Mister Thompson was an indiscreet young </p><p>man. While he ate his left hand strayed </p><p>frequently to his side below the ribs. </p><p>Where does a man wear a money-belt?” </p><p> “I see,” Henderson nodded grimly.</p><p> “What you see, I saw. What I saw,</p><p>other men saw. It was too easy. The </p><p>traveling north to buy horses, the left hand </p><p>feeling for the safety of the unaccustomed </p><p>belt. What more could a man ask?” </p><p> “Yuh saw him leave the dance-hall?”</p><p>prompted Henderson. </p><p> “I did, but that was pure chance. I was</p><p>sitting on my door sill in the moonlight </p><p>when I saw a woman appear in the narrow </p><p>way between the stage station and Carl- </p><p>son’s stable. The moon was almost di- </p><p>rectly overhead, but the eaves of the stable </p><p>threw a shadow, and the opening was in </p><p>darkness. Nevertheless I saw her white </p><p>face as she peered out past the corner of the </p><p>stable in the direction of the dance-hall. </p><p>Her manner was secret, furtive, and conse- </p><p>quently I observed her more closely than I </p><p>would otherwise have done. </p><p> “A moment later Mister Thompson came</p><p>out of the dance-hall and started to walk </p><p>toward the hotel. The woman drew back </p><p>deeper into the shadow. I watched. Mis- </p><p>ter Thompson would have to pass the nar- </p><p>row opening where the woman stood. As </p><p>he passed he stopped. She must have </p><p>called him, but I could not hear. He </p><p>turned aside into the opening and disap- </p><p>peared. That is the last I saw of him.” </p><p> “If yuh could have warned him!” burst</p><p>out Henderson. </p><p> “Primarily, it was not my business.</p><p>Secondly, how could I know what was to </p><p>occur? Thirdly, can a Chinaman warn a </p><p>white man?” Thus Sing Luey without</p><p>rancor. </p><p> “I jumped too sudden,” acknowledged</p><p>Henderson. “Yo’re right an’ I’m wrong. </p><p>Y’ ain’t said nothin’ to anybody else about </p><p>that woman, have yuh?” </p><p> “Hardly. Accidents, especially accidents</p><p>to Chinamen, occur much too easily in this </p><p>country. I prefer a quiet life.” </p><p> Henderson stretched out his long legs</p><p>and crossed one ankle over the other. </p><p> “Iiowdja know I won’t say who told me</p><p>when I get through?” he asked. </p><p> “I know Mister Henderson.”</p><p>“Yo’re takin’ a chance, at that. Have </p><p>yuh got any idea who that woman was?” </p><p>“Not the slightest,” declared Sing Luey. </p><p>“There are fifteen women in Farewell,” he </p><p>added helpfully. </p><p> “How many married?”</p><p> “Ten—with families, each and every</p><p>one.” </p><p>High Pockets </p><p>21 </p><p> “That leaves five—five. Ain’t they five</p><p> girls in the dance-hall?”</p><p> “Exactly.”</p><p> “One o’ them, huh?”</p><p> “I don’t know.”</p><p> “Yuh dunno, but yuh can guess faster</p><p> than a hoss can trot. An’ so can I.”</p><p> “I am glad of that,” felicitated Sing Luey.</p><p> “Who was the ten men eatin’ here same</p><p> time as Rufe?”</p><p> “ ‘Sandy’ Bacon, Piney Jackson, Ben</p><p> Skeel, Kansas Casey, Dolan, ‘Shorty’ Vang,</p><p> Lamp Black, Torney, ‘Eagle River’ Pete</p><p> and Bill Chase.”</p><p> “Would yore pardner, Kung-Foo-Soo,</p><p> trail all o’ them jiggers?”</p><p> “Knowing them as I do, he would elim-</p><p> inate four to begin with.”</p><p> “What four?”</p><p> “Sandy Bacon, Piney Jackson, Kansas</p><p> Casey and Dolan.”</p><p> “Why them?”</p><p> “Slow-thinking and honest, all of them.”</p><p> “That leaves Ben Skeel, Lamp Black,</p><p> Shorty Vang an’ Torney, Eagle River Pete</p><p> an’ Bill Chase. I know Ben Skeel, Shorty</p><p> Vang an’ Torney are Longhorn Simms’</p><p> dealers, an’ I .amp Black’s his look-out.</p><p> Whadda the other two do for a livin’?”</p><p> “Eagle River Pete is the stage-station</p><p> hostler. Bill Chase works for Dolan.”</p><p> “Any reason for suspect in’ the tinhorns?”</p><p> “None—except the nature of their call-</p><p> ing.”</p><p> “How about Eagle River an’ Bill Chase?”</p><p> “They are friendly with the other four.”</p><p> Henderson smiled sunnily.</p><p> “I knowed I had a reg’lar job,” he ob-</p><p> served. “But I got somethin’ to go on—</p><p> now. Have any o’ them six gents yuh speak</p><p> of left town lately?”</p><p> “Not since the murder—that I know of.”</p><p> “Guess yuh’d know it if they had. Tell</p><p> me somethin’. Why yuh doin’ all this?”</p><p> “Doing what?” asked Sing Luey.</p><p> “Readin’ sign for me thisaway.”</p><p> Sing Luey’s blank face became blanker.</p><p> He stared stonily at Henderson.</p><p> “I have answered a great many ques-</p><p> tions,” he observed softly.</p><p> “All right,” said Henderson. “Yuh’ve</p><p> shore acted the part of a real gent, an’ I</p><p> don’t give a - for yore reasons. I’m</p><p> obliged—again. Seems like I’ll be owin’</p><p> yuh a heap before I’m through.”</p><p> “You will owe me nothing when you are</p><p> through.”</p><p> The slanting eyes of Sing Luey glittered</p><p>opal-black in the lamplight. Or was it the </p><p>lamplight? Once, on a street in San Fran- </p><p>cisco, Henderson had been an unwilling </p><p>spectator of a fight between two tongs. </p><p>The eyes of those Chinese gunmen had </p><p>glittered in precisely the same way. Hen- </p><p>derson would have given a great deal to read </p><p>the mind of Sing Luey. </p><p> He stood up and pulled down the brim of</p><p>his hat. </p><p> “Guess I’ll be movin’ along,” he an-</p><p>nounced. </p><p>ST~" HIS walk to the hotel was not </p><p>uneventful. As he was passing the </p><p> —	Starlight Saloon a Winchester in</p><p>the neighborhood of Jackson’s blacksmith’s </p><p>shop cracked viciously, and a bullet grazed </p><p>his left ear. Henderson’s sidewise leap into </p><p>the grateful shelter of the Starlight’s pile of </p><p>empty whisky-kegs would have done credit </p><p>to a bronco. Hot and wrathful, for the ear </p><p>tingled, he crouched behind his breastwork, </p><p>swept off his hat, and peered between two </p><p>slanting empties. </p><p> Jackson’s blacksmith shop, in common</p><p>with every other building in Farewell, lay </p><p>silent under the moon. Of the enterpris- </p><p>ing bushwhacker there was no visible sign.</p><p>Henderson eased back on his heels, laid his </p><p>useless six-shooter across his knee, and ten- </p><p>derly fingered the smarting ear. </p><p> “Serves me-good an’ right,” he told</p><p>himself. “I’d oughta knowed better’n to </p><p>come friskin’ along so free an’ careless on a </p><p>moonlight night. Wonder is it Stute. I </p><p>ain’t really had time to gather many more </p><p>friends—yet.” </p><p> He laughed silently, his eyes on the black-</p><p>smith shop. Behind him the door of the </p><p>Starlight opened suddenly. Henderson </p><p>looked over his shoulder. The tousled and </p><p>sockless bartender stood in the door- </p><p>way. </p><p> “Who’n-fired that shot?” demanded</p><p>the bartender. “It come right through the </p><p>door and busted-” </p><p> “Bang! The flash of the gun winked at</p><p>the corner of the blacksmith shop, and the </p><p>bullet scored a whisky-keg above Hender- </p><p>son’s head and splintered its way through a </p><p>window-frame. Henderson fired twice at </p><p>the flash. </p><p> The door had slammed shut as the glass</p><p>fell tinkling. From within came the muffled </p><p>voice of the bartender. </p><p>22 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Say, for Gawd’s sake go some’ers else,</p><p>will yuh?” he implored. “Them bullets </p><p>come right through.” </p><p> “I like yore nerve!” cried Henderson in-</p><p>dignantly. “You go hide under the bar if </p><p>yo’re scared.” </p><p> “I’m there now. But I ain’t scared.</p><p>It’s where I sleep—under the bar.” </p><p> “Aw right. Go to sleep an’ be-.”</p><p> “How can I sleep with you chunkers</p><p>hellin’ ’round thisaway?” complained the </p><p>bartender. “If yuh gotta go pickin’ feuds </p><p>why don’tcha pick ’em out on the </p><p>range?” </p><p> “I ain’t pickin’ no feuds,” denied Hen-</p><p>derson. “I’m peaceable as all hell myself. </p><p>He’s doin’ the pickin’. Guess he must ’a’ </p><p>thought you was me when he fired that last </p><p>time. Step out in the doorway once an’ </p><p>we’ll fool him again.” </p><p> “You hold yore breath till I do!” snarled</p><p>the peevish bartender. </p><p> Henderson grinned and tipped over an</p><p>empty. Instantly the enemy Winchester </p><p>cracked and drilled the keg. </p><p> “Gettin’ nervous,” decided Henderson.</p><p>“He’ll shoot at anythin’ that moves. Me, </p><p>I’m goin’ away from here. Can’t do nothin’ </p><p>with a six-gun at this range.” </p><p> Lying flat he wriggled backward along</p><p>the sidewalk to the corner of the saloon. </p><p>He rolled ’round the corner, scrambled to his </p><p>feet, and ran as rapidly as his high heels </p><p>permitted to a point of vantage opposite </p><p>the blacksmith shop. Which point was a </p><p>straggly growth of bushes reaching out </p><p>tonguewise from the flank of the hotel </p><p>corral. </p><p> Henderson lay on his stomach among the</p><p>bushes and scanned the place of ambush </p><p>with hopeful eyes. But the prospect was </p><p>blatantly peaceful, and apparently empty of </p><p>all life. Henderson remained where he was </p><p>for fully thirty minutes. The wait was </p><p>barren of results.</p><p> “Roll in, feller,” he told himself, and</p><p>hitched his crawling way back to the </p><p>corral. </p><p> He circled the corral on his feet, and</p><p>entered the hotel through a kitchen win- </p><p>dow. </p><p> “Anyhow, that quick-shootin’ sport</p><p>didn’t see me go into Sing Luey’s, or he’d ’a’ </p><p>bushwhacked me when I come out,” was his </p><p>pleased judgment as he sat down on his cot </p><p>and pulled off his boots. “An’ that’s one </p><p>good tiling y’betcha.” </p><p>CHAPTER VII </p><p>DECEITFULLY SPEAKING </p><p>TUT ENDERSON was up at dawn. He </p><p>■*- -*• never cockered himself in the matter </p><p>of sleep when business was to the fore. He </p><p>couldn’t afford to. Letting himself quietly </p><p>out of the hotel, he angled across the street </p><p>to the blacksmith shop and narrowly in- </p><p>spected the place whence had come the law- </p><p>less bullets of the night. </p><p> In the light of day that side and corner of</p><p>the blacksmith shop wore an aspect of hon- </p><p>est trade. Several wagon wheels Uttered </p><p>the ground. A broken vise cuddled a billet </p><p>of wood. A rusty log chain looped its links </p><p>across the vise. Certainly there were no </p><p>spent shells to be found though Henderson </p><p>got down on his knees and pawed the dusty </p><p>earth about like any terrier. </p><p> Sounded then steps upon the sidewalk.</p><p>Henderson did not desist from his labors. </p><p>A man sauntered past the shop and halted </p><p>at sight of Henderson. The latter looked </p><p>up into the face of the marshal. </p><p> “Lost anythin’?” queried the marshal.</p><p>“My diamond tarara,” was the reply, de- </p><p>livered in a tone of the deepest concern. “I </p><p>wouldn’t ’a’ lost it for two hosses an’ a new </p><p>wagon. It must ’a’ fell off when I was </p><p>cornin’ home from the dance. Never did fit </p><p>like it should, that tarara didn’t. Y’aint </p><p>seen it, have yuh?” </p><p> “Tarara!” repeated the mystified mar-</p><p>shal. “Dance! What dance? They wasn’t </p><p>no dance in town last night. You mean </p><p>the dance-hall?”</p><p> “Who fives next door?” Henderson</p><p>changed the subject drawlingly. </p><p> “Nobody. She’s Piney’s shack where he</p><p>mows away wagon tongues, reaches, neck- </p><p>yokes an’ similar. What-” </p><p> “I was just wonderin’, thassall,” cut in</p><p>Henderson. “I seen she was locked on the </p><p>outside, o’ course. But I always like to </p><p>know for shore. It helps, Marshal. It all </p><p>helps.” </p><p> “Whatcha talkin’ about?” frowned the</p><p>marshal. “Diamond tararas, dances, an’ </p><p>now, ‘It helps.’ What helps what, huh? </p><p>That’s what I wanta know.” </p><p> “Seein’s it’s you, I’ll tell yuh. I’m cornin’</p><p>home to . the hotel in the mornin’ so early </p><p>when a gent right here where I’m squattin’ </p><p>now cuts down on me with a Winchester an’ </p><p>misses puttin’ my light out by less’n a </p><p>inch. Yuh’ll notice my left ear is sort o’ </p><p>High Pockets </p><p>23 </p><p>burnt on top. Which ain’t all he done </p><p>neither. The Starlight’s shy some glass, </p><p>the barkeep’s lost k year’s growth, an’ the </p><p>pile o’ empties out front is drilled a-plenty. </p><p>Such goin’s-on ain’t right a li’l bit. Me, I </p><p>want that night-raidin’ party arrested. </p><p>Yessir, I want him in the calaboose where he </p><p>belongs.” </p><p> “I did hear some shootin’ last night,”</p><p>admitted the marshal. “But I thought it </p><p>was only some o’ the boys feelin’ good. </p><p>An’ you was shot at?” </p><p> “Ain’t I been tellin’ yuh? Want me to</p><p>put it in writin’, huh? Now you hop out </p><p>an’ arrest him like I say, Marshal.” </p><p> “Who is he? Tell me who he is, an’ I’ll</p><p>glom on to him fast enough.” </p><p> “How’d I know who is he? I’m askin’</p><p>you. Yo’re the marshal. You’d oughta </p><p>know. She’s yore job. Fly at it. When </p><p>you grab him, lemme know, an’ I’ll tell yuh </p><p>what to do next.” </p><p> Henderson stood up, dusted his knees,</p><p>grinned cheerfully at the marshal and </p><p>walked away. </p><p> The marshal, with a flushed face, watched</p><p>him go. He was warmly aware that he had </p><p>been made game of. But he did not feel </p><p>quite up to the task of resenting it—not </p><p>with Henderson. The latter was too utterly </p><p>careless of consequences. It was a pleasant </p><p>world. Why seek to leave it? Thus, in his </p><p>uncultured way, reasoned the marshal and </p><p>went home to breakfast. </p><p> From the blacksmith shop Henderson</p><p>went to the Starlight Saloon. The red- </p><p>eyed bartender was yawningly mopping up </p><p>in preparation for the daily tide of </p><p>customers. </p><p> “Curryin’ the floor thisaway is one-</p><p>fool trick,” said the bartender without </p><p>raising his eyes, at Henderson’s entrance. </p><p>“But the boss says she’s gotta be did. </p><p>-, they aint no sense in bein’ so per- </p><p>nickety. She only gets dirty again. I— </p><p>oh, it’s you, is it? He didn’t get yuh, did</p><p>he?” he added in a tone of disappointment. </p><p> “Don’t be so-sorry,” adjured Hen-</p><p>derson. “Where’d them bullets go?” </p><p>“Through the window.” </p><p> “I know that. Where’d they hit?”</p><p> “On the wall yonder.”</p><p> Henderson strode to the indicated wall.</p><p>He found the bullet-holes without diffi- </p><p>culty. They were some ten feet apart and </p><p>bored at an angle. He produced a clasp- </p><p>knife and dug into the wood. </p><p> “Hey, don’t do that!” remonstrated the</p><p>bartender. “Yo’re spoilin’ the planks.” </p><p>“Which yo’re the most contrary gent I </p><p>ever see,” pronounced Henderson, not ceas- </p><p>ing to labor. “Yo’re always wantin’ a fel- </p><p>ler to stop what he’s doin’. She’s a bad </p><p>habit. Yuh’d oughta get over it. I gotta </p><p>have these bullets. I gotta. They’s no </p><p>two ways about it. I’m makin’ a collec- </p><p>tion of all the lead cornin’ my way no mat- </p><p>ter where she hits. Why, feller, s’pose them </p><p>bullets had landed in you. I’d have to be </p><p>diggin’ ’em out o’ yore carcass. Think o’ </p><p>that, an’ shut up.” </p><p> Henderson’s tone toward the end of his</p><p>speech, became sinister. The bartender </p><p>quieted and went sulkily on with his </p><p>work. </p><p> Henderson scooped out the bullets with-</p><p>out difficulty and examined them closely. </p><p>He dropped them into a pocket of his vest </p><p>and rang down a silver dollar on the bar. </p><p> “They’s a wheel for the damage,” he told</p><p>the bartender, and marched out. </p><p> Returning to the hotel he went in to</p><p>breakfast. Of the few guests all were pres- </p><p>ent save Miss Blythe. Henderson, despite </p><p>a late start was the first to finish. As he </p><p>left the dining-room he heard Miss Blythe’s </p><p>door open. But he did not turn his head. </p><p> Mr. Henderson, anxious to disseminate a</p><p>little misleading information, sauntered </p><p>down to the Happy Heart. A modest one- </p><p>fingered drink in the heel of his hand, he ad- </p><p>dressed the bartender. </p><p> “Dunno where I can pick up a few horses</p><p>an’ maybe some mules, do yuh?” asked </p><p>Henderson, conscious that Longhorn Simms </p><p>was standing in the doorway of the back </p><p>room where he ran his games. </p><p> “No, I don’t,” replied the bartender.</p><p>“Some o’ the outfits ’round here might have </p><p>a few hosses to sell. But mules is hard to </p><p>get. When a gent has any he mostly </p><p>figures on keepin’ ’em.” 1 </p><p> “That’s shore tough,” mourned Hender-</p><p>son. “I was countin’ on a few mules. I </p><p>guess now I’ll have to do some ridin’. </p><p>How’s chances for cattle? Just a small </p><p>jag?” </p><p> “Aimin’ to start a ranch?” the bartender</p><p>asked quickly. </p><p>“I might,” was the cautious reply. “An’ </p><p>then again I mightn’t. I might be buyin’ </p><p>’em for somebody else. Yuh can’t tell.” </p><p>He stared fixedly into the bartender’s </p><p>eyes. The man’s gaze wavered, dropped. </p><p>24 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>He swabbed off the bar with sudden indus- </p><p>try. Henderson drank off his liquor and </p><p>departed. </p><p>HE STOPPED at the Blue Pigeon </p><p>and found Miss Blythe taking </p><p>stock. She laid her list on the </p><p>counter, weighted it with her pencil, and </p><p>smiled upon him frankly. </p><p> “I wanted to see you as soon as I could,”</p><p>she said, “but you’d gone when I went to </p><p>breakfast. I haven’t thanked you for— </p><p>for everything. I am-” </p><p> “Now thassallright,” hastily interrupted</p><p>Henderson. “Yo’re lettin’ me do it is </p><p>thanks enough, ma’am. So don’t you go </p><p>thinkin’ about it no more. Just forget it.” </p><p>“1 shan’t and I won’t. Don’t you sup- </p><p>pose I know why you were shot at last </p><p>night? It was because you befriended me. </p><p>You’re running risks on my account.” </p><p> She stopped, her dark eyes shining, her</p><p>lower lip caught between her teeth. </p><p> “Who told yuh I was shot at?” he de-</p><p>manded almost roughly. </p><p> “No one. I heard the marshal telling</p><p>Mister Flynn. Why, the top of your ear’s </p><p>black with dried blood! You’ve been </p><p>wounded, and you never told me! You </p><p>stay right here till I get some hot water and </p><p>bathe it and bandage it.” </p><p> “Ma’am, yuh musn’t—I can’t!” protested</p><p>Henderson, terrified lest a customer enter </p><p>and find him being tended. “My ear’s </p><p>fine. Only a scratch. Don’t hurt a-tall. </p><p>She’s healin’ awready. Don’tcha bother. </p><p>I can’t wait. I got business. Ma’am, </p><p>please!” </p><p> It was the piteous entreaty that the girl</p><p>could not resist. She paused with her hand </p><p>on the canvas curtain of the doorway lead- </p><p>ing to the rear room. </p><p> “Come back, an’ sell me some neat’s-foot,”</p><p>he begged. “I wanna oil my saddle.” </p><p>“You’re sure it’s all right?” she said </p><p>earnestly, returning slowly. “Doesn’t it</p><p>hurt a little?” </p><p> “Not one li’l li’l,” he assured her.</p><p> “But I don’t like it. You get hurt and</p><p>won’t let me help you. You might have </p><p>been killed.” </p><p> “I wasn’t, an’ I come mighty nigh</p><p>downin’ the other gent. Don’tcha fret. </p><p>Next time I’ll rub him out shore.” </p><p> Miss Blythe went white as the flour sacks</p><p>on the shelf behind her. </p><p> “For heaven’s sake, be careful!” she</p><p>cried. “If anything should happen to you </p><p>because of me I’d never forgive myself— </p><p>never!” </p><p> “Somebody’s cornin’,” warned Hender-</p><p>son. “Better get me that neat’s-foot.” </p><p>Piney Jackson, entering in quest of </p><p>matches, found Henderson sedately paying </p><p>a pale-cheeked girl for a can of neat’s-foot </p><p>oil. Henderson left at once with his oil. </p><p>Piney, asking for matches, was presented </p><p>with a plug of chewing. </p><p> “I asked for matches, ma’am,” said the</p><p>blacksmith. </p><p> “I beg your pardon,” murmured Miss</p><p>Blythe. “I’m a little—I don’t know the </p><p>stock very well yet.” </p><p> “ ’Tsall right, ma’am. They’re on the</p><p>left there, second shelf.” </p><p> Henderson picked up his saddle and</p><p>bridle from where they lay under a window </p><p>in the hotel dining-room and carried them </p><p>out to the corral. He dropped the saddle </p><p>across a convenient log, straddled the log, </p><p>and proceeded to oil the leather with care </p><p>and a soft rag. </p><p> He had finished the saddle and was start-</p><p>ing in on the bridle when Longhorn Simms </p><p>strolled ’round the corner of the hotel-and </p><p>advanced upon him. Mr. Simms’ inten- </p><p>tions were apparently pacific. He was </p><p>smoking a long cigar. His thumbs were </p><p>hooked in the armholes of his vest. The </p><p>black eyes flanking the broken nose twinkled </p><p>amiably. </p><p> “Howdy,” was the gambler’s greeting.</p><p>“Tol’rable, tol’rable,” said Henderson, re- </p><p>garding him gravely. “How’s yore health?” </p><p>“I’m able to eat,” replied Longhorn </p><p>Simms, standing with legs spread wide. </p><p>“I’ve seen yuh in the Happy Heart. My </p><p>name’s Simms.” </p><p> “I heard it was,” said the noncommittal</p><p>Henderson. </p><p> “Yeah,” persisted Mr. Simms, not in the</p><p>least dashed by the other’s manner. “I </p><p>hear yo’re in the market for hosses, mules </p><p>an’ cattle.” </p><p> “Yuh must ’a’ heard me talkin’ to the</p><p>bartender.” </p><p> Henderson rubbed his oily rag across the</p><p>crownpiece. </p><p> “I did,” confessed Mr. Simms. “An’ I</p><p>know where yuh can get some hosses, </p><p>mules too.” </p><p> “That’s good hearin’. Where?”</p><p> “The 88 ranch.”</p><p> “The 88 ranch?”</p><p>High Pockets </p><p>25 </p><p> “Yeah, the manager has more hosses</p><p> than he wants, an’ six Texas mules he’s</p><p> aimin’ to sell.”</p><p> “When’d he tell yuh?”</p><p> “He didn’t tell me. I heard a couple o’</p><p> his boys talkin’ at the bar.”</p><p> “When?” Henderson drawled the ques-</p><p> tion, his attention obviously centered on a</p><p> stiff curbstrap.</p><p> “Oh, last week sometime. I disremem-</p><p> ber exactly.”</p><p> This was interesting. Mr. Simms had</p><p> been in receipt of the news when he stood</p><p> in the doorway of the Happy Heart’s back</p><p> room, listening to Henderson asking ques-</p><p> tions of the bartender. Yet Mr. Simms had</p><p> kept back his information. Henderson</p><p> wondered whether Mr. Simms had had</p><p> speech with Mr. Stute in the interval.</p><p> Henderson thoroughly oiled a check-piece.</p><p> “If yo’re thinkin’ o’ ridin’ out to the 88,”</p><p> Mr. Simms continued, “I guess I’ll trail</p><p> along with yuh. I got business there,</p><p> too.”</p><p> “I didn’t say I had business there,” said</p><p> Henderson.</p><p> “But them hosses an’ mules—you</p><p> said-”</p><p> “But maybe I wouldn’t wanna go to the</p><p> 88 right now. Maybe now I’d rather try</p><p> the Cross-in-a-box, or somethin’.”</p><p> “What’s the use 0’ wastin’ time on them</p><p> other ranches when I know the 88 has</p><p> hosses an’ mules for sale?”</p><p> “Yo’re shore advisin’ me for my own</p><p> good,” admitted Henderson. “Yessir, it’s</p><p> right neighborly of yuh, Mister Simms.</p><p> Guess I’ll drift out there tomorrow.”</p><p> “I’ll go with yuh, if yuh ain’t got no</p><p> objections. When-”</p><p> “You didn’t gimme time to say whether</p><p>-	I had objections,” complained Hender-</p><p> son.</p><p> “Have yuh?” Mr. Simms managed a</p><p> smile.</p><p> “I ain’t. Not one li’l objection. Yo’re</p><p> as welcome as a cool breeze. Be here at</p><p> four o’clock in the mornin’. I’ll be waitin’.”</p><p> “That’s pretty early,” objected Mr.</p><p> Simms, thinking of his nightly labors.</p><p> “You don’t have to come. Guess I</p><p> could struggle along without yuh.”</p><p> “I’ll be here,” Mr. Simms declared</p><p> shortly. “So long.”</p><p> Henderson smiled happily at his saddle</p><p> as Mr. Simms walked away.</p><p> “Guess I must ’a’ riled him,” was his</p><p>thought. “Some get riled most awful </p><p>easy, an’ some—don’t. Him an’ me’s due </p><p>to have one real salubrious ride—not.” </p><p>HE TOOK from his vest pocket the </p><p>two pieces of lead he had dug from </p><p>the wall of the Starlight. He al- </p><p>ready knew that their caliber was .45-90, a </p><p>caliber common to many rifles in the </p><p>Territory. He shook the bullets dice- </p><p>fashion in the palm of his hand and swore </p><p>mildly. </p><p> “If I was a real detective,” he reflected,</p><p>“these here li’l babies would tell me a whole </p><p>lot. Yessir, one look at ’em, en’ I’d know </p><p>the kind of a gent who fired ’em, the color </p><p>of his whiskers, where he lives when he’s </p><p>home an’ the names o’ his pa an’ ma. I </p><p>wonder what’n-I dug ’em out for?” </p><p> He flipped the bullets into the tongue of</p><p>brush beyond the corral and stooped to </p><p>retrieve his fallen rag. But his eyes idly </p><p>followed the bullets in their flight, and he </p><p>did not immediately straighten. For he </p><p>marked a curious stir among the bushes at </p><p>the spot where the lead fell—a slight com- </p><p>motion that could not by any means be </p><p>directly attributed to the bullets. </p><p> Henderson sat upright, laid the rag tidily</p><p>across the top of the can, and stretched </p><p>luxuriously. Then he arose and walked</p><p>slowly ’round to the opposite side of the </p><p>corral. Once past the corner, he removed </p><p>his spurs and quickened his pace. </p><p> Sixty seconds later, walking softly on the</p><p>balls of his feet, he was approaching the </p><p>tongue of bushes from the rear. He </p><p>stopped at the edge, craned his neck, and </p><p>peered into the brush. There, on the far- </p><p>ther side, like a jack-rabbit in its form, a </p><p>man lay on his stomach. By the turn of his </p><p>head he seemed to be watching the gate of </p><p>the corral and the log on which Henderson’s </p><p>saddle trailed its stirrups. </p><p> “I ain’t there no more,” Henderson ob-</p><p>served in a conventional tone. </p><p> The man humped himself at the hips and</p><p>scrambled to his frightened feet. He faced </p><p>Henderson trembling, his mouth opening </p><p>and closing spasmodically, his eyelids bat- </p><p>ting frantically. He was the dance-hall </p><p>roustabout, a poor creature men in their </p><p>humor had christened “Snakebite,” for he </p><p>was subject to epilepsy. </p><p> “Who set you here to watch me?” Hen-</p><p>derson asked gently. </p><p> Snakebite shook in his not-too-clean</p><p>26 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> clothing till he resembled a scarecrow in a</p><p> gale, and gobbled unintelligibly.</p><p> “Who did?” persisted Henderson.</p><p> “He’ll kuk-kill me!” the wretched Snake-</p><p> bite wailed mournfully.</p><p> “Yuh needn’t squeal,” said Henderson,</p><p> “Geddown quick before somebody sees yuh.”</p><p> Snakebite dropped instantly. Hender-</p><p> son squatted on his heels.</p><p> “Tom Stute told yuh to come here an’</p><p> watch me, didn’t he?” Henderson pur-</p><p> sued inexorably.</p><p> Snakebite stared with terror-stricken,</p><p> bleary eyes.</p><p> “Didn’t he?” persisted the former.</p><p> Snakebite nodded forlornly.</p><p> “I thought so.”</p><p> “He’ll kuk-kill me,” repeated the un-</p><p> happy pilgarlic, his mind refusing to be di-</p><p> verted from that cardinal issue.</p><p> “I expect—if he knows it,” observed</p><p> Henderson grimly. “But he needn’t know</p><p> it, unless you tell him. I won’t tell him,</p><p> y’betcha.”</p><p> The blear-eyes grew less wobegone.</p><p> “See,” went on Henderson, “I ain’t</p><p> tellin’ nothin’, an’ don’t you. Here’s a</p><p> dollar.”</p><p> Snakebite’s talons clutched the piece of</p><p> silver. He pouched it swiftly in the one</p><p> good pocket of his tattered trousers. Dol-</p><p> lars were few and far between with the</p><p> Dewdrop roustabout.</p><p> “What’d he tell yuh to do?” asked</p><p> Henderson.</p><p> “He told me to watch when yuh got yore</p><p> hoss an’ see which way yuh went,” said</p><p> Snake-bite, becoming calmer with every</p><p> breath he drew.</p><p> “Goin’ to watch all day?”</p><p> “All night, if I had to,” he said.</p><p> “He shore works his help, that feller.</p><p> Here’s the makin’s an’ matches, Snake-</p><p> bite. Just you lay an’ smoke an’ watch</p><p> like a good jigger, an’ when yuh go back yuh</p><p> can tell yore boss I ain’t caught up my hoss</p><p> none. An’ remember he’ll shore hang yore</p><p> hide on the fence if he finds out I caught</p><p> yuh here.”</p><p> “I’ll remember,” Snakebite nodded</p><p> gratefully.</p><p> “Where’d them bullets hit yuh?” asked</p><p> Henderson.</p><p> “What-what bull—oh, them! Was them</p><p> bullets? I thought they was rocks. Hit</p><p> me on top of the head, so they did, -</p><p> hard. I near jumped up.”</p><p> “I guess that must ’a’ been whyfor I dug</p><p>’em out,” Henderson grinned. </p><p> “Dug ’em out?”</p><p> “Nothin’ you’d understand, Snakebite.</p><p>So long.” </p><p> Henderson raised a cautious head and,</p><p>seeing no one, stood up and unhurriedly </p><p>retraced his steps to the saddle and the oil. </p><p> “He ain’t leavin’ nothin’ to chance, that</p><p>Stute gent,” he said to himself as he sat </p><p>down on the log and picked up his bridle. </p><p>“I wonder now does he think I’m aimin’ to </p><p>give that tinhorn Simms the slip. I’m </p><p>shore wonderin’ a whole lot.” </p><p>CHAPTER VIII </p><p>THE DEWDROP </p><p>HOUGHT you’d gone home.” Hen- </p><p>derson gazed at Chuck Morgan in </p><p>mild surprise. </p><p> “I did,” said Chuck, dismounting spring-</p><p>ily. “But I forgot somethin’. I come back </p><p>for it.” </p><p> “Yore memory is shore a fright, but you</p><p>didn’t forget nothin’. You come back </p><p>lookin’ for trouble, that’s what yuh come </p><p>back for. Ain’tcha got no sense a-tall? </p><p>Yo’re married an’ yuh’d oughta-” </p><p> “Aw, shut up about me bein’ married,</p><p>will yuh? I know I’m married, an’ I’m </p><p>-glad of it, but it don’t prevent me want- </p><p>in’ to frisk ’round he-fashion, do it? You </p><p>gimme a pain! Yuh talk like I wasn’t </p><p>human, or somethin’. Ain’t this a free </p><p>country? Ain’t I got my growth?” </p><p> “Yo’re a - fool,” Henderson said</p><p>affectionately. “All the same yuh’d oughta </p><p>stayed away. Yore wife-” </p><p> “She said if I didn’t come I wasn’t her</p><p>husband, so there y’are. Yuh needn’t go </p><p>to jumpin’ sideways. I only told her you </p><p>was in Farewell ’n’ a side-kicker would </p><p>come in handy. Jane ain’t forgot that </p><p>fracas over south o’ Injun Ridge, even if </p><p>you have.” </p><p> Chuck’s allusion concerned an incident</p><p>of the trail wherein Morgan, beset by several </p><p>gentlemen bent upon his assassination, had </p><p>been rescued by Henderson. </p><p> “Aw -Henderson said helplessly</p><p>and let it go at that. </p><p> “What do we do now?” queried the ener-</p><p>getic Mr. Morgan. </p><p> “Nothin’—now. Tonight I sort o’ figured</p><p>on lookin’ in at the dance-hall.” </p><p>High Pockets </p><p>27 </p><p> “Now yo’re whistlin’ a tune! Maybe</p><p>Tom Stute’s hand’ll be all right again. </p><p>Maybe he’ll want action, him an’ his friends. </p><p>An’ you was a-goin’ to swing an’ rattle with </p><p>that crowd on yore high lonesome! Well, </p><p>all I gotta say-” </p><p> “Don’t say it. Let’s go over to the</p><p>blacksmith shop an’ pitch hoss-shoes. </p><p>Two-bits a game. C’mon.” </p><p> By five o’clock Chuck was seven games</p><p>ahead. Piney Jackson, having successfully </p><p>set a stubborn tire, called it a day, and </p><p>wanted in. </p><p> “Hop to it,” said Henderson. “Take my</p><p>place. I gotta go buy me the makin’s. </p><p>An’ I shore hope yuh beat this wall-eyed </p><p>pirate. He’s all swelled up like a poisoned </p><p>pup right now with a dollar six-bits 0’ my </p><p>money in his pants pocket. Take it away </p><p>from him.” </p><p> Henderson hitched up his trousers and</p><p>walked along the street to the Blue Pigeon. </p><p>He found Mrs. Rule and Mrs. Jackson </p><p>buying groceries. The former lady was </p><p>bewailing the fact that the store was out </p><p>of her pet brands of canned corn and baking- </p><p>powder. </p><p> “An’ I was aimin’ to have succotash an’</p><p>biscuits tonight for Jake,” grumbled Mrs. </p><p>Rule. “I want him to send East for a </p><p>melojum, an’ he’ll do anythin’ for me when </p><p>he’s full of succotash an’ biscuits.” </p><p> “Ain’t it the truth?” chimed in Mrs.</p><p>Jackson. “Give a man what he wants to </p><p>eat an’ he’ll say ‘yes’ to anythin’. Not but </p><p>what Piney ain’t a easy man to do for an’ a </p><p>good provider,” she added hastily, unwilling </p><p>that her hearers should for one moment </p><p>doubt that her husband possessed all mortal </p><p>virtues. “But grub shore does count, an’ </p><p>that’s a fact. You wait till yo’re married, </p><p>honey, an’ you’ll see.” </p><p> This last was to Miss Blythe’s address.</p><p>She promptly blushed red as any artillery </p><p>guidon. </p><p> “I’ll—I’ll never get married,” she stam-</p><p>mered. </p><p> “Don’t think it,” said Mrs. Rule. “You</p><p>won’t have no trouble, not with them eyes </p><p>an’ hair. But don’t you be in no hurry. </p><p>Take yore time an’ look ’round a-plenty. </p><p>Thev’s lots o’ men in this world, but they’s </p><p>only one husband. Be sure he’s steady an’ </p><p>saves his money, an’-” </p><p> Henderson withdrew to the street and</p><p>kicked restless heels against an empty box </p><p>till Mrs. Rule and Mrs. Jackson, arm-laden </p><p>and chattering endlessly, departed home- </p><p>ward. </p><p> At Henderson’s entry Miss Blythe looked</p><p>up from the ledger in which she was adding </p><p>a column of figures and smiled her winsome </p><p>smile at him. Her cheeks were still be- </p><p>comingly flushed. </p><p> “How yuh gettin’ along?” he asked, his</p><p>grin answering the smile. </p><p> “Mister Flynn says I’m learning very</p><p>quickly. I like it here lots. Mister Flynn </p><p>is awfully kind and patient with me. How </p><p>is your ear?” </p><p> She eyed with concern the organ in ques-</p><p>tion. </p><p> “Fine. He would be. He’s one white</p><p>gent, he is. I was just wonderin’, ma’am, </p><p>if—if yuh’d like—if some Sunday now—if </p><p>I get yuh a gentle cayuse—can yuh ride, </p><p>ma’am?” </p><p> “Why, yes, I can ride,” replied she.</p><p> “Then that’s all right. Will yuh go</p><p>ridin’ with me some Sunday?” The words </p><p>at last came out with a rush. </p><p> He stood at gaze, perspiring slightly.</p><p> “I’d just love to go,” was the heartening</p><p>answer. </p><p> “I’ll fix it up soon’s I can,” he told her.</p><p> Jingle, rattle, thud, and clink in dusty</p><p>Main Street. The stage from the south </p><p>was rolling in. At the sound the girl’s face </p><p>blanched. The pupils of the dark eyes</p><p>dilated. She caught her breath sharply. </p><p> “I wonder where I left my handkerchief?”</p><p>she said in a low tone, and walked to the </p><p>front of the store, and made a show of </p><p>searching the shelves near the window. </p><p> Henderson did not fail to perceive that,</p><p>while her hands poked about among cans of </p><p>tomatoes and peas, her eyes strayed ever </p><p>toward the street and the halted stage. </p><p> Henderson slid backward till he too could</p><p>look out of the window at the stage. One </p><p>by one the passengers alighted. They were </p><p>five in number—four obvious punchers and </p><p>a salesman lugging his sample-case. The </p><p>girl came back, her fingers drumming on the </p><p>counter. The noiseless Mr. Henderson </p><p>had apparently not moved from his place </p><p>near the ledger. </p><p> “I guess I must have lost it,” she said</p><p>carelessly. </p><p> “It’s stickin’ out over yore belt,” Hen-</p><p>derson informed her. </p><p> “So it is.”</p><p> She pulled out the handkerchief and</p><p>tucked it in place again. </p><p>28 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Guess I’ll take a couple o’ sacks o’</p><p>tobacco an’ some papers,” said Henderson. </p><p> He went away with his purchase, fingers</p><p>rolling a preoccupied cigaret. </p><p> “When the stage come in she got scared,”</p><p>he reflected. “When she come back from </p><p>the window after seein’ who got off she </p><p>wasn’t. She thinks somebody’s a-trailin’ </p><p>her, that’s a cinch. When he, she, or it </p><p>drifts in I shore gotta be in Farewell free </p><p>an’ adjacent, y’betcha.” </p><p>IN THE cool of the evening Mr. </p><p>Henderson and Mr. Morgan visited </p><p>the dance-hall. Under the flaring </p><p>lamps, to the tucker and lilt of “Soldier’s </p><p>Joy,” a sweating cowboy was dancing a jig, </p><p>and dancing it well. The Dewdrop’s deni- </p><p>zens and the customers lined wall and bar </p><p>and cheered the puncher on. Mr. Stute </p><p>and Mr. Bill Chase, the former with his </p><p>right arm in an ostentatious sling, stood </p><p>beside the fiddler’s table. The entrance of </p><p>Mr. Henderson and his friend passed un- </p><p>noticed for a space. </p><p> When the bartender became mindful of</p><p>his duties, Mr. Henderson was leaning </p><p>against the end of the bar near the door, and </p><p>Mr. Morgan stood across the room, his at- </p><p>tention obviously centered on the hard- </p><p>working dancer. </p><p> The bartender approached Mr. Hender-</p><p>son and looked at him with unfriendly eyes. </p><p> “Whisky,” Mr. Henderson said briefly.</p><p> The bartender filled the order, collected</p><p>and withdrew to the far end of the bar. </p><p>He caught the eye of his employer, grinned </p><p>one-sidedly and jerked his head backward. </p><p>Mr. Stute glanced along the bar and moved </p><p>closer to Mr. Chase in order to obtain a </p><p>better view. Mr. Chase looked up, saw </p><p>Henderson, and instantly assumed the un- </p><p>conscious expression of a wooden Indian. </p><p>Not so Mr. Stute. He reddened with an- </p><p>ger and walked with stiff, quick strides to </p><p>Mr. Henderson. And as he walked the </p><p>fiddling ceased, the cowboy stopped in the </p><p>middle of a step, and men and women, </p><p>nudging one another, turned their eyes upon</p><p>that tall, lean citizen standing at the end of </p><p>the bar. </p><p> “My arm has not yet entirely recovered,”</p><p>stated Mr. Stute, facing Henderson at the </p><p>distance of a yard. </p><p> “That’s shore tough,” commiserated Mr.</p><p>Henderson. “But I ain’t yore doctor.” </p><p> Mr. Stute was pleased to ignore the</p><p>flippancy. He glared into the eyes of Mr. </p><p>Henderson. But the latter had stared into </p><p>the eyes of grimmer, harder men than Mr. </p><p>Stute. The washed-out gray gaze held </p><p>steady. The spirit behind the black eyes </p><p>struggled all it knew, but it did not know </p><p>enough. Mr. Stute’s eyes flickered, </p><p>dropped and fastened themselves on Mr. </p><p>Henderson’s top shirt-button. </p><p> “When my hand’s well,” Mr. Stute began</p><p>thickly. </p><p> “You’ll be able to go ridin’,” supplied Mr.</p><p>Henderson. </p><p> “I warn you I’ll shoot on sight.”</p><p> “Thanks for the warnin’. I didn’t need</p><p>it. All I gotta do is watch yore hand to </p><p>play safe. Yo’re so-slow with a gun.” </p><p> This to Mr. Stute, who had, till the com-</p><p>ing of this stranger, prided himself on his </p><p>ability to draw. Never a person of equable </p><p>temper, Mr. Stute now lost his head. He </p><p>shifted his feet and struck left-handed at </p><p>his tormentor’s face. A blue flash arced </p><p>in the lamplight, steel struck bone with a </p><p>cracking snap, and Mr. Stute thumped </p><p>down on his knees at Henderson’s feet. </p><p>Mr. Stute’s features were convulsed with </p><p>pain, he grunted like a pig. It may be said </p><p>that he suffered. </p><p> Henderson took a step backward, the</p><p>long gun with whose barrel he had broken </p><p>Mr. Stute’s wrist, swinging at his knee. </p><p> “Yuh hadn’t oughta make a break like</p><p>that,” he observed dispassionately, ad- </p><p>dressing Mr. Stute, but watching with </p><p>alert care the spectators. “Once again the </p><p>hand is quicker than the eye.” </p><p> A great silence, marred solely by the</p><p>porcine plaints of Mr. Stute, was upon the </p><p>roomful. The women after their kind, </p><p>looked at Mr. Stute, the men at Henderson. </p><p>No one moved. </p><p> The bartender was the first to recover</p><p>himself. His hands, which had been rest- </p><p>ing on the bar, slid slowly inward. His </p><p>body became rigid. </p><p> “I s’pose they’s a six-shooter behind the</p><p>bar,” drawled Henderson. “Hop to it, </p><p>feller.” </p><p> The bartender’s hands froze to the wood.</p><p>The red-haired girl, with two round red </p><p>dapplings of rouge on cheeks from which all </p><p>the blood had receded, shook her half- </p><p>naked shoulders and stumbled forward to </p><p>the side of Mr. Stute, and slipped a hand </p><p>beneath his quivering armpit. </p><p> “Get a hold o’ yoreself, Tom!” she</p><p>High Pockets </p><p>29 </p><p>shrilled. “Gimme a lift here, some o’ yuh! </p><p>We gotta get him to bed!” </p><p> It was borne in upon Henderson that he</p><p>had outstayed his welcome. He and Chuck </p><p>Morgan oozed warily crabwise through the </p><p>doorway into the street. </p><p> “Yuh shore have put Tom in the discard</p><p>for a spell,” chuckled Morgan, when their </p><p>legs were straddling the log near Lainey’s </p><p>corral gate. </p><p> “I expect,” mourned Henderson. “-</p><p>his soul! What’d he have to come squinchin’ </p><p>’round for? I wanted to look over them </p><p>women.” </p><p> “Huh?” The surprise in Morgan’s tone</p><p>was patent. </p><p> “Rufe met one of ’em after he left the</p><p>dance-hall that night,” explained Hender- </p><p>son. </p><p> “Yuh never told me that!”</p><p> “I was goin’ to. Anyway, yuh know now.”</p><p> “Howdja find it out?”</p><p> “A li’l bluebird with pink whiskers told</p><p>me.” </p><p> “She’s gotta be true then. Pink whiskers</p><p>never lie. Which one of them floozies was </p><p>it?” </p><p> “That’s what I gotta find out.”</p><p> “Djuh think the woman downed him?”</p><p> “I dunno what to think yet,” dodged</p><p>Henderson. “I was aimin’ to sort o’ get </p><p>acquainted with them females.” </p><p> “It don’t seem like a woman would</p><p>carve a feller the way Rufe Thompson was </p><p>carved,” Morgan said soberly. </p><p> “Yuh can’t tell. Yuh can’t tell nothin’</p><p>about it. Gotta wait, that’s all. Tomorrow </p><p>me an’ Longhorn Simms are rid in’ out to the </p><p>88 to buy bosses an’ mules. Maybe I’ll </p><p>know somethin’ by the time I get back.”</p><p>“Maybe yuh won’t get back.” </p><p> “I don’t look sickly, do I?”</p><p> “I’m goin’ too,” declared Chuck Morgan.</p><p>“You ain’t. Two’s company. Yo’re </p><p>gonna stay here. Yuh can pitch hoss shoes </p><p>with Piney Jackson, if yuh like.” </p><p> “I don’t like. Not a-like. Long-</p><p>horn’s one bad actor, I’m tellin’ yuh.” </p><p> “Yuh talk like Longhorn’s a crowd, or</p><p>somethin’.” </p><p> “He’ll cold-deck yuh. Him an’ Stute’s</p><p>thicker’n two drunkards with a jug.” </p><p> “I know Longhorn’s crooked as a dog’s</p><p>hind leg, but I like to gamble, always have. </p><p>Don’tcha fret. Me an’ Mister Simms will </p><p>scatter along all same Sunday-school schol- </p><p>ars on a picnic.” </p><p> “She’ll be one helluva picnic,” averred</p><p>the doubting Mr. Morgan, and let the </p><p>subject drop. </p><p> It is not in the range code to insist that a</p><p>friend is not utterly capable of taking care </p><p>of himself. </p><p>CHAPTER IX </p><p>THE ARTFUL DODGER </p><p>AT PRECISELY four o’clock in the </p><p>morning Henderson led his yellow </p><p>horse through the gateway of Lainey’s cor- </p><p>ral. It was daylight. The sun was just </p><p>rising over the eastern hills. The windows </p><p>of the hotel shone redly in the flat rays. </p><p>Henderson swung up and rode out into Main </p><p>Street. </p><p> Longhorn Simms, his mount a staring</p><p>white pony with black legs, loped out from </p><p>behind the blacksmith shop. A flicker of </p><p>bright interest gleamed in Henderson’s </p><p>gray eyes at sight of the white pony. </p><p>“Mornin’,” was the gambler’s greeting. </p><p> “Howdy,” returned Henderson. “We’d</p><p>oughta make it before grub-time to- </p><p>night.” </p><p> “Shore ought—if we keep a-movin,”</p><p>concurred the gambler, and fell in at </p><p>Henderson’s side. </p><p> Their fifty - yard shadows streaking</p><p>splotchily the ground on the right, they </p><p>single-footed out upon the trail to the south. </p><p>As they rode they discussed amicably the </p><p>meager news of cowland—reports of rustling </p><p>beyond the Hogpen range; the lynching of a </p><p>horse-thief by the impulsive citizens of </p><p>Marysville; the backsliding of Tommy Mull, </p><p>Cutter’s hotelkeeper. </p><p> “Which that Tommy Mull shore cele-</p><p>brated when he jumped the fence,” said </p><p>Longhorn Simms. “An’ he wants every- </p><p>body in on it, too. He goes the limit, that </p><p>jigger does, an’ Cutter shore has a savage </p><p>time. Why, the station boss an’ his helper </p><p>is so drunk Whisky Jim has to catch up his </p><p>teams his own self.” </p><p> “Anybody killed?”</p><p> “Naw, course two or three has to quarrel,</p><p>but pie-eyed gents most gen’ally miss, an’ </p><p>they was an’ they did.” </p><p> “Tha’s good. The Territory aint got so</p><p>many folks she can afford to go shy any </p><p>inhabitants unless they’s a reason. I hear </p><p>they was a feller rubbed out here a couple </p><p>o’ months ago.” </p><p>30 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Less’n that—six or seven weeks. Rufe</p><p>Thompson his name was.” </p><p> “Some old silver-tip, huh?”</p><p> “Young jigger, under thirty.”</p><p> “Yeah? I didn’t know he was young as</p><p>that. Sliced all up, they said.” </p><p> “Shore was.”</p><p>“An’ they never found out who done it?” </p><p>“Not yet. When they do he’ll be lynched </p><p>whoever he is. She was shore one cowardly </p><p>killin’.” Both Mr. Simms’ manner and </p><p>tone were righteously indignant. </p><p> “I hear the dead gent didn’t have a</p><p>chance.” </p><p> “Course not. His gun wasn’t even</p><p>pulled.” </p><p> “Whadda you guess?” Thus, casually,</p><p>Mr. Henderson. </p><p> “Some gent had a grudge against him,</p><p>that’s a cinch,” the gambler declared with </p><p>conviction. “Else why would he carve him </p><p>all up thataway? Some gent with a grudge, </p><p>I say. Jake oughta do somethin’.” </p><p> “They say they’s no evidence.”</p><p> “They must be some. Find the gent</p><p>with a grudge. He’s the one done it.” </p><p>The grudge theory seemed an obsession with </p><p>Mr. Simms. </p><p> “I guess maybe yo’re right,” said Mr.</p><p>Henderson, and rolled a meticulous cigaret. </p><p> It was to be observed that, while building</p><p>the slim roll, his hands were held low be- </p><p>tween his middle and the saddle-horn. A </p><p>hand in this position is enabled to go after a </p><p>six-shooter concealed under a vest without </p><p>loss of time.	' v</p><p> The cigaret completed, between his lips</p><p>and lighted, Henderson’s right hand fell </p><p>away to his side, the fingers brushing the </p><p>butt of the gun tied down on his right leg. </p><p>Mr. Simms rode on that side. Henderson</p><p>had carefully maneuvered him into that </p><p>position at the start. </p><p> He was leaving nothing to chance, al-</p><p>though he did not believe that Mr. Simms </p><p>would become personally and actively </p><p>hostile. He believed that a radically dif- </p><p>ferent plan of action skulked behind the </p><p>black eyes of Mr. Simms. </p><p> In perfect conversational accord the two</p><p>men topped Indian Ridge and rode down </p><p>the reverse slope. At the foot of the ridge </p><p>the trail ducks in and out of a shallow draw. </p><p>Which draw runs west and east. Hender- </p><p>son elected to turn westward along the </p><p>draw. Mr. Simms voiced instant and vig- </p><p>orous objection. </p><p> “Why not?” Henderson wished to know.</p><p>“Why for?” countered the gambler. </p><p>“Here’s the trail. We’re a-ridin’ it now. </p><p>Whatsa use o’ squanderin’ all over the </p><p>range thisaway? Hard goin’ over west, </p><p>too. They’s some hills we’ll have to go </p><p>’round. We’ll lose time.” </p><p> “I heard this was a short-cut,” wavered</p><p> Henderson.</p><p> “Yuh heard wrong. She’s ten miles long-</p><p> er, easy.”</p><p> “Shore?”</p><p> “Shore as yo’re a foot high.”</p><p> “Then le’s go by the draw. I’m feelin’</p><p> just like one long ride.”</p><p> The smile of Mr. Henderson was disarm-</p><p> ing in its innocence.</p><p> “I tell yuh—” began Mr. Simms.</p><p> “Don’t tell her too hard,” suggested</p><p>Henderson. “ Yuh might waste yore breath </p><p>—or somethin’.” </p><p> The gambler strove to read Henderson’s</p><p> eyes, but they told him nothing.</p><p> “Aw right,” he said ungraciously. “We’ll</p><p> go yore way, an’ I’m tellin’ yuh yuh’11 wish</p><p> yuh hadn’t.”</p><p> “I’ll remember,” Henderson told him</p><p>cordially. “If yo’re wrong I won’t hold it</p><p>against yuh.” </p><p> “You’ll see,” grumbled the gambler.</p><p> Familiar discourse ceased for several</p><p> hours. Not till noon became afternoon</p><p> did Mr. Simms break the silence.</p><p> “Yuh seem to know this country -</p><p>well,” observed Mr. Simms. </p><p> “I’ve been askin’ questions,” said Hen-</p><p> derson. “Where’s that hard sleddin’ you</p><p> was talkin’ about?”</p><p> “Well, she’s miles longer anyway,” Mr.</p><p> Simms defended lamely.</p><p> “Yeah? We’ll see. Go yuh ten we</p><p>reach the 88 before supper.” </p><p> “I ain’t bettin’, ” grunted the gambler.</p><p> “I dunno as I wanta go no further. Guess</p><p> maybe I’ll be leavin’ yuh.”</p><p> “I wouldn’t do that,” drawled Hender-</p><p>son the palm of his hand resting as if by </p><p>chance, on the butt of his gun. “I like yore </p><p>company, Mister Simms. Yo’re amusin’. </p><p>Yo’re amusin’ as all hell.” </p><p> A man of hastier nerves would have im-</p><p> mediately resented Henderson’s innuendo.</p><p> But Mr. Simms manifested perfect control</p><p> over his nervous system and proved him-</p><p> self a highly dangerous citizen by smiling</p><p> amiably.</p><p> “I’m glad yuh think so,” said he. “In</p><p>High Pockets </p><p>3i </p><p> my business I can’t afford to make folks</p><p> laugh.”</p><p> “Yuh shore make me laugh,” grinned</p><p>Henderson. </p><p> But the gambler merely smiled &lt;).gain.</p><p>THEY rode silently onward through </p><p>the hot, bright afternoon, the ten- </p><p>sion between them growing with </p><p>every step of their horses’ feet. Relative </p><p>to shooting the gambler Henderson felt </p><p>no compunction. It was shoot or be shot. </p><p>And Simms had the call. Henderson, se- </p><p>cure in the belief that he himself had the </p><p>edge, waited serenely. No amount of ten- </p><p>sion could affect his nerves. </p><p> So the minutes passed without incident</p><p>till Tom Dowling of the 88 galloped out of a </p><p>draw and swung in their direction. </p><p> “Well, I’ll bedam if it ain’t Bill Hender-</p><p>son!” bawled Tom Dowling, when he was </p><p>close upon them. .“Ii’are yuh, Bill? </p><p>Howdy, Simms.” </p><p> Tom crowded his horse alongside and</p><p>heartily shook Henderson’s hand. </p><p> “This is shore luck,” declared Tom,</p><p>“runnm’ up on you two gents thisaway. I </p><p>guessed I’d have to ride in alone. Cornin’ </p><p>to hunt you a job, Bill? We’re a man </p><p>short.” </p><p> “No, I ain’t, Tom. Me an’ Mister Simms</p><p>is just ridin’ out on business. Is Lanpher </p><p>still manager?” </p><p> “Shore he is. But most o’ the outfit’s</p><p>new since you was here.” </p><p> “I was right the first time,” cut in Mr.</p><p>Simms, addressing Henderson. “Yuh do </p><p>know this country pretty well.” </p><p> “I oughta,” Henderson averred com-</p><p>placently. “Yuh see, I used to work for </p><p>the 88.” </p><p> “Yuh didn’t tell me that,” fretted Mr.</p><p>Simms. </p><p> “Guess I forgot. My memory gives me</p><p>a heap 0’ trouble sometimes.” </p><p> “I expect.”</p><p> Tom Dowling began to sense that all was</p><p>not smooth between these two. He won- </p><p>dered why. Henderson turned his head </p><p>slightly and winked at him, thus completing </p><p>the puncher’s mystification. </p><p> Henderson was now smoking a much</p><p>needed cigaret. He could afford to quite </p><p>safely. Mr. Simms would not dare make </p><p>conspicuously uncalled-for war in the pres- </p><p>ence of Tom Dowling. Henderson almost </p><p>laughed. </p><p> So, in the late afternoon, they came to the</p><p>squat buildings and broad corrals of the 88 </p><p>ranch. From the open doorway of the </p><p>ranch-house kitchen drifted the clatter of a </p><p>snarling voice laying down the law. </p><p> “An’ I tell yuh, cookie,” nagged the</p><p>voice, “that coffee tasted like dishwater. </p><p>You make a good potful tonight, an’ see </p><p>she’s good. An’ don’t fry the steak to </p><p>leather like yuh done the last time. Think </p><p>my teeth is steel, or somethin’? Well, </p><p>they ain’t, an’ I don’t aim to wear ’em out </p><p>neither.” </p><p> “Lanpher must be home,” observed</p><p>Henderson. </p><p> “Sounds that way,” chuckled Tom Dow-</p><p>ling. “He lays out cookie reg’lar once a </p><p>week. Says it keeps him from gettin’ </p><p>uppity. ’F I was cookie I’d shore crawl his </p><p>hump a few, but cookie don’t giveadam. </p><p>He just laughs.” </p><p> A slim little rat of a man with a narrow,</p><p>frowning face appeared in the kitchen door- </p><p>way and surveyed the three horsemen. </p><p> “Howdy, Bill,” said the little man, walk-</p><p>ing toward them. “Ii’are yuh, Longhorn? </p><p>I s’pose now yuh want a job, Bill, huh?” </p><p>“Not me, Lanpher,” replied Henderson, </p><p>backing and turning his horse till he faced </p><p>both Simms and the 88 manager. “I come </p><p>here to buy hosses an’ mules. Longhorn </p><p>Simms says yuh got both to sell.” </p><p> “Well, I ain’t, not by a jugful,” denied</p><p>Lanpher. “I need all my ponies, an’ I </p><p>wouldn’t sell my four mules at no price </p><p>nohow.” </p><p> “I guess now yuh must ’a’ made a mis-</p><p>take, Simms,” drawled Henderson. </p><p> “Maybe I did,” said the gambler, levelly</p><p>regarding Henderson. </p><p> “Yeah, I guess so. But you didn’t make</p><p>no mistake when yuh cinched yore saddle on </p><p>that white cayusc so yore bushwhackin’ </p><p>friends hidin’ along the trail some’ers would </p><p>know we was coinin’ a long way off an’ have </p><p>time to get ready a-plenty.” </p><p> “Whatcha talkin’ about?” asked Mr.</p><p>Simms, his sinister features depicting in- </p><p>tense amazement. </p><p> “I ain’t through talkin’ yet,” pursued</p><p>Henderson, as the prudent Lanpher skipped </p><p>nimbly in one direction and Tom Dowling </p><p>jumped his horse in another. “I’d just like </p><p>to know why Tom Stute’s friends gotta horn </p><p>in on his quarrel? Why can’t they let Tom </p><p>settle it when he gets ready ’stead o’ smooch- </p><p>in’ ’round tryin’ to wipe me out thisaway?” </p><p>32 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Yo’re crazy!” cried Mr. Simms.</p><p> “Don’tcha s’pose I know it was you cut</p><p>down on me from behind Jackson’s black- </p><p>smith shop that night?” snapped Hender- </p><p>son at a venture. </p><p> Mr. Simms, ceased to dissemble. His</p><p>right hand flicked to his vest-pocket, and it </p><p>flicked with speed. But Henderson’s agile </p><p>fingers were a&gt; split-second speedier. Mr. </p><p>Simms, a neat hole in his right shoulder, </p><p>swayed, clutched at the saddle-horn, missed </p><p>his grip and pitched backward to the </p><p>ground. </p><p> As has been said, Mr. Simms was a hard</p><p>citizen. There was still a deal of fight in </p><p>Mr. Simms. He writhed sidewise, and </p><p>went after his other derringer left-handed. </p><p>Henderson accurately drove a bullet </p><p>through his left elbow. Mr. Simms went </p><p>flat, his nose in the dirt, and mumbled </p><p>curses through set teeth. </p><p> “Y’all seen it,” said Henderson, cold gray</p><p>eyes sweeping Lanpher, Tom Dowling and </p><p>the open-mouthed cook in one compre- </p><p>hensive glance. “He went after his gun </p><p>first.” </p><p> “Shore he did,” Lanpher made haste to</p><p>assure him. </p><p> “It was an even break, y’betcha,” pro-</p><p>nounced Tom Dowling. </p><p> The cook said nothing. He was too</p><p>filled with awe to utter a word. It was the </p><p>first time he had ever seen a man shot. </p><p>CHAPTER X </p><p>THE NEW ARRIVAL </p><p>“‘V7’OU come back alone yest’day. The </p><p> *	boys wanna know where Longhorn</p><p>Simms is at?” It was the marshal of </p><p>Farewell speaking. </p><p> He loomed above Henderson where the</p><p>latter sat in his tip-tilted chair in front of </p><p>the hotel. </p><p> “What boys?” drawled Henderson, look-</p><p>ing at the marshal with sleepy eyes. </p><p> “Longhorn’s friends. An’-”</p><p> “He’s got friends, huh? I didn’t know</p><p>that.” </p><p> Henderson shook the ash from his</p><p>cigaret with a flirt of his wrist and grinned </p><p>at the marshal. </p><p> “Don’t get gay,” warned the marshal.</p><p>“Tell-” </p><p> “I ain’t gettin’ gay,” denied Henderson.</p><p>“I’m solemn as a graveyard. What I can’t </p><p>see is why them friends o’ Longhorn’s don’t </p><p>come to me personal. What they got to </p><p>send you for?”	»</p><p> “They didn’t send me. I come myself.</p><p>An’ Jake Rule an’ Kansas Casey are cornin’ </p><p>in a minute.” </p><p> “Then I’ll wait till they come. No use</p><p>o’ tellin’ the same thing twice, is they, </p><p>Marshal?” </p><p> The officer made no reply. He stepped</p><p>heavily to the chair temporarily vacated </p><p>by Bill Lainey and sat down. Henderson </p><p>turned a lazy head and looked northward </p><p>along Main Street. The sheriff’s com- </p><p>bination house and office was the outermost </p><p>building at the north end of town. A group </p><p>of men were standing in front of the sheriff’s </p><p>house. While Henderson sat at gaze the </p><p>official front door opened, the sheriff and </p><p>Kansas Casey issued and joined the waiting </p><p>group. By twos and threes, Jake Rule </p><p>and his deputy in the lead, the little crowd </p><p>moved briskly southward. </p><p> “Ben Skeel, Shorty Vang, Torney an’</p><p>Lamp Black,” Henderson said to himself, </p><p>his eyes following the progress of the </p><p>sheriff and his train, “Eagle River Pete, </p><p>an’ Bill Chase. All they need is Tom </p><p>Stute to make her complete.” </p><p> He flipped his cigaret-butt into the air</p><p>and hooked his long thumbs in his belt. </p><p> “Looks like visitors,” observed Chuck</p><p>Morgan, suddenly appearing in the hotel </p><p>doorway. </p><p> “Don’t it,” said Henderson.</p><p> Chuck Morgan leaned hipshot against</p><p>the door jamb. His eyes shone with </p><p>pleasurable anticipation. </p><p> Opposite the Happy Heart the sheriff</p><p>and his followers changed direction and </p><p>headed diagonally across the street toward </p><p>the hotel. Mike Flynn, sitting on the </p><p>doorsill of his shop, stood up as the crowd </p><p>passed him and stumped hurriedly in- </p><p>doors. </p><p> The sheriff and his following halted at</p><p>the edge of the sidewalk in front of Hen- </p><p>derson. Jake Rule and his deputy were </p><p>in front. The others remained modestly </p><p>in the rear. There was no crowding. </p><p> “Where’s Longhorn Simms?” the sheriff</p><p>asked without preliminary. </p><p> “At the 88 ranch,” replied Henderson.</p><p> “What’s he stayin’ there for?”</p><p> “ ’Cause he can’t ride.”</p><p> “Why can’t he ride?”</p><p> “ ’Cause I had to plug him.”</p><p>High Pockets </p><p>33 </p><p> “What’d I tell yuh?” cried foxy-faced</p><p>Ben Skeel. </p><p> “Whatja plug him for?” the sheriff kept</p><p>squarely to the main issue. </p><p> “Whadda yuh gen’ally plug a jigger for?”</p><p>drawled Henderson. “ ’Cause yuh like him </p><p>or somethin'?” </p><p> “Whadja plug him for?” Jake Rule</p><p>persisted patiently. </p><p> “We had a argument; an’ Longhorn went</p><p>after his gun first.” </p><p> “That’s a—” began Shorty Vang, and</p><p>cleared his throat raucously instead of </p><p>completing the sentence. </p><p> “Shorty seems to have a cold,” observed</p><p>Henderson. “What was yuh gonna say, </p><p>Shorty? Le’s hear it.” </p><p> Shorty, looking anywhere save at Hen-</p><p>derson, glimpsed Mike Flynn sidewheeling </p><p>across the street. In the hollow of Mike’s </p><p>arm rested a sawed-off Greener. Mike sat </p><p>down on a fortuitous whisky keg in front </p><p>of the next house and nursed the shotgun </p><p>across his knees. There was a slight stir </p><p>among the friends and employees of Mr. </p><p>Simms. The sheriff glanced over his </p><p>shoulder. </p><p>“Whatcha doin’, Mike?” he demanded. </p><p>“Clanin’ me Greener,” replied the Irish- </p><p>man, jerking a blue bandanna from a hip- </p><p>pocket and proceeding to vigorously polish </p><p>his armament. </p><p> Jake Rule’s wide mouth twitched at the</p><p>corners. He said no more to Mike Flynn, </p><p>but turned again to Henderson. </p><p> “Yuh say Simms went after his gun first,”</p><p>remarked the sheriff. </p><p> “Yep.”</p><p> “All right. I ain’t doubtin’ yore word,</p><p>but I’m gonna send my deputy over to the </p><p>88 an’ see what they say. I s’pose now </p><p>they was witnesses?” </p><p> “Shore was. Lanpher, Tom Dowlin’ an’</p><p>the cook. They all seen it.” </p><p> “That’ll be good—for you. While we’re</p><p>waitin’ for my deputy to come back— </p><p>Kansas, you better start right now—while </p><p>we’re waitin’ you’ll have to give up yore </p><p>gun an’ roost in the calaboose.” </p><p> “Not me,” Henderson declared cheer-</p><p>fully. “I don’t hand over no gun, an’ </p><p>I don’t stick in no calaboose, none what- </p><p>ever. I ain’t got nothin’ against you, </p><p>Sheriff, personal, but if you go to throw </p><p>down on me this deal will finish in the </p><p>smoke.” </p><p> “What he says goes double for me,</p><p>Jake,” Chuck Morgan announced quietly. </p><p> The hammers of Mike Flynn’s shotgun</p><p>clicked suggestively to full cock. </p><p> Jake Rule hesitated. He was a brave</p><p>man. He had gone against the iron many </p><p>times. But there are moments when to </p><p>walk softly is the course of wisdom. He </p><p>knew nothing of Henderson, but he did </p><p>know that Mike Flynn and Chuck Morgan </p><p>of the C Y were numbered among the fore- </p><p>most citizens of the county. Behind Chuck </p><p>Morgan was the might and influence of the </p><p>great Bar S ranch. Jack Richie, the Cross- </p><p>in-a-box manager, and his hard-riding </p><p>outfit, were Chuck’s warm and partisan </p><p>friends.- Election day would arrive in </p><p>November, and the sheriff had his heart </p><p>set on a third term. The contest would be </p><p>close. The sheriff was in a quandary. </p><p>Politics is indeed a dreadful thing. </p><p> “Tell yuh what, Jake,” said Chuck</p><p>Morgan suddenly. “Yuh know me. Take </p><p>my word he won’t skip till yo’re good an’ </p><p>satisfied the shootin’ was on the level. </p><p> “Take mine too,” cut in Mike Flynn.</p><p>“If Mister Henderson don’t stay here in </p><p>town I’ll give yuh my store.” </p><p>AT THIS juncture Miss Blythe </p><p>came out of the Blue Pigeon and </p><p>ran across the street to the knot </p><p>of men in front of the hotel. She hopped </p><p>up on the sidewalk and faced the sheriff. </p><p>Henderson stood up and took a step </p><p>toward her.</p><p> “What do you want with him?” she</p><p>demanded hysterically, her small fists </p><p>doubled so tightly that the knuckles </p><p>showed white. “Your wife just told me </p><p>you were going to put him in jail for shoot- </p><p>ing a man. If he did the man deserved it. </p><p>You shan’t put him in jail! I tell you, </p><p>you shan’t!” </p><p> Miss Blythe, pink-cheeked, stamped her</p><p>foot at the sheriff. The latter backed away </p><p>and flapped futile hands at the excited </p><p>young lady. </p><p> “Now, ma’am,” he began helplessly.</p><p>“Now, ma’am-” </p><p> “Go away, ma’am, please,” begged the</p><p>scandalized Henderson, laying a hand on </p><p>her ann. </p><p>“I won’t!” she snapped without looking </p><p>at him, and jerked her arm free. “I won’t </p><p>till I know what that man intends to do!” </p><p>She glared upon “that man.” The </p><p>wretched sheriff gulped. It was his custom </p><p> ■ *r</p><p>34	Adventure</p><p>to tell his wife everything. He cursed the </p><p>custom now. </p><p> “Lookit here, Sheriff,” Henderson said,</p><p>“s’pose I come down to yore office an’ stay </p><p>’round you till Kansas gets back. How’s </p><p>that?” </p><p> “Fine,” the sheriff agreed thankfully.</p><p>“Chuck better come too.” </p><p> “There, see, everythin’s all right,” Hen-</p><p>derson told Miss Blythe. </p><p> Miss Blythe squeezed the palms of her</p><p>hands against her hot cheeks. She dropped </p><p>her arms and turned away. </p><p> “It had better be,” she said wearily, and</p><p>walked with drooping shoulders back to the </p><p>Blue Pigeon. </p><p> “Any time yo’re ready, Henderson,”</p><p>hinted Jake Rule. </p><p> Henderson, Chuck Morgan, the sheriff,</p><p>and a commandeered friend of the latter, </p><p>spurred the flitting hours with the national </p><p>game of draw. It was an expensive session </p><p>for the sheriff and his friend. </p><p> “I hope Kansas hurries back,” the sheriff</p><p>remarked at half-past ten that night. </p><p> “I don’t,” grinned Henderson, en-</p><p>trenched behind five tall columns of chips. </p><p>“One card, Sheriff.” </p><p> “I’ll take two,” said Chuck Morgan.</p><p>“I ain’t partic’lar if Kansas has to walk. </p><p>I’m plenty strong now, but I aim to get </p><p>stronger. Runnin’ a ranch is expensive.” </p><p>“So’s cards,” grieved the sheriff’s friend, </p><p>eying his lonely stack of whites. </p><p> Late in the afternoon of the following</p><p>day Kansas Casey dismounted in front of </p><p>the sheriff’s house. </p><p> “Aw-he groaned, when he pushed</p><p>open the door and perceived the card- </p><p>players hunched in tense absorption over </p><p>their four-square game. “Aw -he</p><p>repeated, “I’ve missed somethin’.” </p><p> “You ain’t,” denied the sheriff. “Yo’re</p><p>lucky to been away. Chuck an’ Hen- </p><p>derson have won about everythin’ but the </p><p>jail. Give ’em- another ten minutes an’ </p><p>they’d had that.” </p><p> “Ain’t we gonna play no more?” Hen-</p><p>derson cried in alarm. </p><p> “We ain’t,” the sheriff declared. “What</p><p>did Lanpher say, Kansas?” </p><p> “Just what he said,” Kansas told him, in-</p><p>dicating Henderson with a jerk of his head. </p><p> “Then yo’re plenty free to drag it,</p><p>Henderson,” said the sheriff. </p><p> “Thanks,” Henderson said dryly. “I</p><p>take it yuh want to cash in, Sheriff.” </p><p> “You bet. About that gray pony an’</p><p>saddle you won, Henderson—they’s the </p><p>saddle an’ bridle in the corner, an’ the </p><p>cay use is out in the corral. I’d like to buy </p><p>that hoss back next month. He’s the only </p><p>plumb gentle pony in my string. Don’t </p><p>pitch, kick, bite, nor nothin’. Pie ain’t </p><p>no go-devil of a man’s hoss, an’ I dunno </p><p>as he’d suit yuh anyway.” </p><p> “He’ll suit this man,” grinned Henderson.</p><p>“I like a quiet life once in a while. I heard </p><p>he was gentle as a kitten. That’s why I </p><p>got yuh to bet him. So yuh see, Sheriff, </p><p>just how it is.” </p><p> Henderson’s tone was politely regretful.</p><p>The sheriff figuratively said good-by to his </p><p>pet pony. </p><p> Ten minutes later Henderson, his pockets</p><p>heavy with part of his winnings, was leading </p><p>the saddled remainder to the hotel corral. </p><p> “Whadda you want this kind o’ hoss</p><p>for?” queried the inquisitive Chuck, bliss- </p><p>fully, patting his own bulging pockets. </p><p> “Wanna see if he’s gentle like I heard,”</p><p>was the unilluminating reply. </p><p> In the furtherance of this desire Hen-</p><p>derson presently strapped a blanket ’round </p><p>his waist, boarded his new acquisition and</p><p>loped his three times ’round the corral, </p><p>turned him on a dime, and trotted him </p><p>the other way. Then he thumbed him, </p><p>an operation which invariably elicits a buck </p><p>if one is available. But the pony merely </p><p>pointed inquiring ears and attended to his </p><p>knitting with admirable calm. Henderson </p><p>pulled up in triumph in front of Chuck, </p><p>slipped to the ground, and unstrapped the </p><p>leg-enshrouding blanket. </p><p> “Mostly a blanket floppin’ ’round their</p><p>hocks bothers even the gentlest,” observed </p><p>Henderson, stripping off saddle and bridle. </p><p>“But not this U’l gray feller. He don’t </p><p>mind nothin’.” </p><p> “I dunno but what I’ll buy him for the</p><p>wife’s sister,” said Chuck. “Molly’s been </p><p>devilin’ me for a hoss all her own for the </p><p>last month. ’Course this three-legged dogie </p><p>ain’t nothin’ to brag about. Still—what’ll </p><p>yuh take for the li’l runt, Bill?” </p><p> “Couldn’t think of it nohow. I ain’t</p><p>never had a pet before. I wanna see what </p><p>it feels like. Whatclia gonna do now, </p><p>Chuck?” </p><p> “Eat. Le’s have a smile at the Starlight</p><p>first.” </p><p> “Aw right. Meet yuh there in half an</p><p>hour. Got a li’l business to fix up first.” </p><p>High Pockets </p><p>35 </p><p> “Oh yeah, shore,” yapped Chuck, his</p><p>tongue in his cheek. “Gotta go to the </p><p>Blue Pigeon an’ get yuh some smokin’, </p><p>huh?” </p><p> “Cartridges, cowboy, cartridges,” was</p><p>the unsmiling reply as Henderson straight- </p><p>way departed. </p><p> “That Blythe lady is shore handsome,”</p><p>the deserted Chuck admitted to the gray </p><p>pony. “But she can’t hold a candle to my </p><p>Jane,” he added loyally. </p><p> “I got a gentle hoss for yuh,” announced</p><p>Henderson from the doorway of the Blue </p><p>Pigeon. “Why—whatsa matter?” </p><p> For Miss Blythe, white-faced, was staring</p><p>through the front window with wide, fear- </p><p>stricken eyes. </p><p> “That man!” she gasped, her hands at her</p><p>breast. “He’s followed me!” </p><p>' Henderson wheeled and looked critically </p><p>at a passing rider. The latter was a tall </p><p>' fellow mounted on a black-and-white pinto. </p><p>He dismounted at the Happy Heart </p><p>hitching-rail, tied his horse, and went in. </p><p> “You mean the gent on the paint pony?”</p><p>Henderson turned to Miss Blythe. </p><p> “Yes,” she whispered miserably.</p><p> “What’s he done?” he asked, coming</p><p>forward to the eounter and leaning on it </p><p>with spread arms. </p><p> The girl gazed blankly up at Henderson.</p><p>She presssed a shaking hand against her </p><p>throat. The courage which had enabled </p><p>her to face the sheriff had forsaken her </p><p>utterly. </p><p> “He said I’d never get away,” she</p><p>stammered through chattering teeth. “He </p><p>said he’d follow me and find me, and he </p><p>has.” </p><p> “It won’t do him a bit o’ good,” guar-</p><p>anteed Henderson, taking possession of </p><p>her hand and patting it awkwardly. </p><p>“I’ll—I’ll be right back.”</p><p> He swung about and started toward the</p><p>door. </p><p> “No! No!” cried Miss Blythe in a panic</p><p>and darted beneath the hinged flap at the </p><p>end of the counter and seized his arm with </p><p>both hands. “You mustn’t!” she almost </p><p>sobbed. “You mustn’t do anything! You </p><p>mustn’t! Do you hear?” </p><p> He looked down at her, his eyes frostily</p><p>sinister. Gently he strove to disengage her </p><p>fingers from their grip. She clung the </p><p>harder and began to cry. </p><p> “Oh, I wish I were dead!” she wept, her</p><p>dark-brown head pressed against his sleeve. </p><p> This was different. Henderson decided</p><p>to postpone for a space his chat with the </p><p>pinto’s owner. </p><p> “Le’s talk it over,” he suggested. “It’s</p><p>almost six. Mike won’t care if yuh lock </p><p>up without waitin’ for him to come back. </p><p>Here, gimme the key, an’ you skip right </p><p>over to the hotel. I’ll see yuh after supper.” </p><p> The distraught Miss Blythe snatched the</p><p>key from its hook between the ammunition </p><p>calendars, slapped it into Henderson’s </p><p>hand, and started streetward. She started </p><p>back with equal suddenness. For the tall </p><p>owner of the black-and-white pinto blocked </p><p>the doorway. </p><p>HE WAS a lithe citizen, this person, </p><p>broad-shouldered, thin-flanked, and </p><p>handsome with that dissolute form </p><p>of comeliness popularly ascribed to Lucifer, </p><p>the fallen angel. </p><p> At sight of the shrinking girl, the man’s</p><p>light eyes widened with enjoyment. His </p><p>full bps parted in a smile. Henderson he </p><p>disregarded wholly. Lucifer’s horizon, men- </p><p>tal and visual, at that moment was the </p><p>frightened Miss Blythe. </p><p> “This is shore luck,” averred the new-</p><p>comer, taking a forward step and pushing </p><p>back his wide hat. “I never knowed when </p><p>I come in here for tobacco I was gonna find </p><p>you.” The bantering tone of his voice </p><p>changed abruptly to one of dark menace </p><p>as he drove the question at her. “Whadja </p><p>run away for?”</p><p> “Maybe she wouldn’t choose to answer,”</p><p>Henderson interposed mildly. </p><p> The stranger whirled like a cat, ready</p><p>hand dropping. </p><p> “Don’t,” advised Henderson. “A pocket</p><p>derringer’s a handy li’l thing,” he added </p><p>meaningly. </p><p> Henderson’s right hand was in his</p><p>trousers pocket. A significant protuber- </p><p>ance bulged within that pocket. The </p><p>would-be exponent of truculence promptly </p><p>hooked his thumbs in the armholes of his </p><p>vest and leaned back against the counter. </p><p> “Yo’re gettin’ careless,” continued Hen-</p><p>derson softly. “Yore holster’s tied down </p><p>so yuh can’t shoot from the hip, an’ she’s </p><p>wore out so bad the foresight has busted </p><p>through an’ snagged in the leather. I could </p><p>’a’ got yuh forty times while you was </p><p>wrestlin’ with yore gun. You’d oughta file </p><p>that foresight or buy a new holster—or </p><p>somethin’.” </p><p>36	Adventure</p><p> “Dj’ever try mindin’ yore own business?’</p><p> queried the stranger coldly.</p><p> “When I feel like it.”</p><p> “They say a gent don’t never get sick or</p><p> nothin’ mindin’ his own business.”</p><p> “I’ve heard that too.”</p><p> “I aim to be in town a while.”</p><p> “Stay as long as yuh like. She’s a free</p><p> country.”</p><p> “Maybe I’ll see yuh again.”</p><p> “Don’t strain yoreself.”</p><p> “I guess this’ll be all for now. Joy, I’ll</p><p> be back later—when you ain’t so busy.”</p><p> “The lady will always be busy—to you,”</p><p> Henderson declared pleasantly.</p><p> “Think so?”</p><p> “Shore as yo’re a foot high. Stranger,</p><p> listen here. The minute you step in this</p><p> store, the minute you open yore yap to this</p><p> lady, you come a-runhin’, ’cause I will.”</p><p> “Yo’re figurin’ on bein’ right busy,”</p><p> sneered the stranger.</p><p> “It ain’t no trouble to curry a li’l short</p><p> hoss, no trouble a-tall.”</p><p> “We’ll see.”</p><p> “My eyesight’s always been plumb good,”</p><p> said Henderson.</p><p> The stranger set his hat straight and</p><p> jingled out into the street. Henderson,</p><p> watching through the window, saw him</p><p> stride quickly up to his horse, seize him by</p><p> the bit and kick the unfortunate animal</p><p> six times in the stomach. After which</p><p> the stranger belted the pinto over the head</p><p> with the butt of his wire-wound quirt,</p><p> kicked him again for good measure, and</p><p> swaggered into the Happy Heart.</p><p> Henderson viewed the preceding exhibi-</p><p> tion of brutality with indifference. Not</p><p> that he was callous to the suffering of dumb</p><p> animals. He was by nature kind to his</p><p> own, and beat them only when necessity</p><p> demanded that they be beaten. But he</p><p> was wholly of the cow-country, and in the</p><p> cow-country a man’s horse is his chattel to</p><p> do with as he will. To interfere between</p><p> them is inconceivable.</p><p> Henderson turned back to Miss Blythe</p><p> who was mopping her eyes with a totally</p><p> inadequate handkerchief and fighting to</p><p> regain control of herself. She looked up</p><p> at him bravely.</p><p> “I’m an awful bub-baby,” she stuttered.</p><p> “Bub-but he sus-scares me so.”</p><p> “He won’t no more. Come along now.</p><p> Yo’re through for this day.”</p><p> She obeyed him meekly.</p><p> “I don’t want any supper,” she said dully,</p><p> on the way to the hotel.</p><p> “Me neither. We can go out back o’ the</p><p> corral, where we was before if yuh like, an’</p><p> yuh can talk all yuh want.”</p><p> He was taking it for granted that she was</p><p> to tell him her troubles. She seemed to</p><p> take it for granted, too.</p><p> “I thought you were going to shoot him</p><p> there in the store,” she told him with a</p><p> shiver.</p><p> “I couldn’t ’a’ shot him,” he said simply,</p><p> “not with what I had in my pocket. I</p><p> didn’t have no derringer. I just stuck my</p><p> thumb against the cloth an’ bluffed him</p><p> out.”</p><p> Miss Blythe made no comment. She</p><p>was realizing more and more fully that this </p><p>person with the washed-out gray eyes was </p><p>not as other men. </p><p>CHAPTER XI </p><p>A TROUBLOUS TALE </p><p>’“T’M FROM the East,” she said, sitting </p><p>on a split cracker-box behind the </p><p>corral, while he squatted on one heel facing </p><p>her, “Whitewillow, Minnesota. Father </p><p>died when I was a baby, and mother died </p><p>last year. There were only two of us then, </p><p>my brother Tim and myself. Tim couldn’t </p><p>see any opportunity in Whitewillow. He</p><p>was always ambitious, and always talking </p><p>about the West. That was the place to </p><p>succeed in. He had the Western fever </p><p>badly. </p><p> “After mother went Tim decided to go</p><p>West. He left me in Whitewillow to wait </p><p>till he could send for me. I worked for </p><p>the village dressmaker. I can sew pretty </p><p>well, and trim hats too. </p><p> “Tim wrote me that he had taken up a</p><p>claim ten miles east of Marysville, the </p><p>county-seat of Fort Creek County, this </p><p>Territory.” </p><p> “Must ’a’ been on Calf Creek,” said</p><p>Henderson. </p><p> “It is—at the Twin Springs,” nodded</p><p>Miss Blythe. “Three months ago Tim </p><p>sent for me. I came. Within the month </p><p>Tim’s horse reared over backward. Tim </p><p>couldn’t roll free in time. The horn caught </p><p>■	him in the stomach. He only lived two</p><p>days.” </p><p> The girl fell abruptly silent and looked</p><p> out across the flats.</p><p>High Pockets </p><p>37 </p><p> Henderson looked at the ground and</p><p>swore silently. Miss Blythe’s clipped re- </p><p>cital was making it increasingly evident </p><p>that the burdens of this imperfect world </p><p>are not shared equally by men and women. </p><p> Miss Blythe planted her elbows on her</p><p>knees, clasped her hands, and continued: </p><p> “I stayed on at the claim. It was pretty</p><p>lonely. But I didn't know what else to do. </p><p>I didn’t care to go back to YVhitewillow. </p><p>I haven’t relatives there, or anywhere, that </p><p>I know of. I tried to sell our cattle and </p><p>two of the horses. I couldn’t find a buyer </p><p>for them, but I knew if I could stick it out </p><p>and prove up on the claim that I might </p><p>be able to sell it later and go somewhere </p><p>else where—where I could find my own kind </p><p>of work. </p><p>} “Then Sam Bellows came. That’s the </p><p>man you drove out of the store—the man </p><p>I’m afraid of. He saw me one day when </p><p>I rode into Marysville for supplies, and he </p><p>followed me out to the claim. He tried to </p><p>make lul-love to me.” </p><p> Henderson remained outwardly calm.</p><p>Inwardly he seethed with a great seething. </p><p> “I managed to throw a kettle of boiling</p><p>water at him,” she went on. “He jumped </p><p>backward and didn’t get scalded much. I </p><p>got Tim’s gun and threatened to shoot him </p><p>if he didn’t go away. He went away, but </p><p>he said he’d come back. He did—that </p><p>night. He tried to break in, and I fired </p><p>through the door, and I heard him laugh </p><p>and ride away. </p><p> “The next day I went to Marysville and</p><p>appealed to the marshal for protection. </p><p>The marshal laughed at me and said I must </p><p>have encouraged Bellows. Encouraged </p><p>him! I! </p><p> “He came into the office while I was</p><p>talking to the marshal, and the marshal </p><p>asked him about it. Bellows said he was </p><p>just trying to help me and that I imagined— </p><p>things. The marshal told me to go home </p><p>and not bother him any more, that I had </p><p>no business nestering on Calf Creek any- </p><p>way. You see, the marshal had a ranch</p><p>on the creek only a few miles from ours, </p><p>and our cows used to run with his, I expect. </p><p>But we only had a few—forty-two head. </p><p>And it really is free range.” </p><p> “It shore is, ma’am. Lookit here, why</p><p>didn’tcha go to Judge Allison?” </p><p> “Judge Allison? I never heard of him.</p><p>Who’s he?” </p><p> “The Federal judge. He lives in Marys-</p><p>ville. He’s one white gent, an’ he’d ’a’ </p><p>seen yuh through.” </p><p> “Oh, I wish I’d known that! But I</p><p>didn’t, and I went home as fast as I could. </p><p>Bellows came after me, but I beat him to </p><p>the house, and I rode the horse right into </p><p>the kitchen and barred the door again. </p><p>I had the gun and I shot through the win- </p><p>dow at him, but I’d ndver fired a gun before, </p><p>and I missed him. He walked right up to </p><p>the window and dared me to fire again. </p><p>I wanted to fire again. I couldn’t. I tried, </p><p>and I couldn’t. He just stood there laugh- </p><p>ing at me while I was pointing the gun at </p><p>him. But—he didn’t come in. He said </p><p>he’d be back the next day, and it wouldn’t </p><p>do me any good to run away, he’d follow </p><p>and find me no matter where I went. </p><p> “That night I packed some clothes in a</p><p>bag, wrapped my blue dress and high shoes </p><p>in a slicker, and nailed up the door. I </p><p>hated'to leave the place. It—it was my </p><p>home, mine and Tim’s. But I’m going </p><p>back, of course, when things quiet down a </p><p>little. I turned the other two horses out </p><p>of the corral so they could get grass and </p><p>water, poor things, and rode away. I </p><p>traveled northwest till I came to a trail that </p><p>I knew must be the trail to Farewell and </p><p>Paradise Bend. I meant to go to Paradise </p><p>Bend. </p><p>‘ “So I changed to my blue dress and other </p><p>shoes where some box-elders grew beside </p><p>a little creek, wrapped my corduroy skirt </p><p>and flannel shirtwaist in the slicker and </p><p>hid the bundle with my saddle and bridle </p><p>in the box-elders. Then I drove my horse </p><p>away and went back to the trail to wait for </p><p>the stage. </p><p> “I had some money in a little bag pinned</p><p>inside my—my dress, and I had some more</p><p>in my sus-stocking, and while I was sitting </p><p>on my bag waiting for the stage I felt for </p><p>the money in my stocking, and there was </p><p>only a big hole. I suppose it chafed its </p><p>way through while I was riding. Anyway, </p><p>it was gone.” </p><p> “But money’s heavy. Didn’t yuh feel it</p><p>slippin’ dr somethin’?” </p><p> Henderson reddened vividly.</p><p> “I didn’t feel it go. You see, it wasn’t</p><p>in gold. It was in bills—what I’d saved </p><p>while I worked in Whitewillow. Well, </p><p>I went back to the box-elders and hunted </p><p>and hunted, but of course I didn’t find it. </p><p>In the morning when the stage came by </p><p>I took it, and I found I only had enough </p><p>38 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> to pay my way to Farewell with a little</p><p> over. So now you know all about me—</p><p> everything.”</p><p> She rested her chin on her hands and</p><p> stared unseeingly over Henderson’s head.</p><p> “I see,” said he slowly, “I see. Yuh—</p><p> say, where didja try to sell them cows?”</p><p> “In Marysville. I didn’t know where</p><p> else to go.”</p><p> “Who’djuh ask?”</p><p> “I asked the marshal first. He owned</p><p> the next ranch, and I thought, naturally,</p><p> he’d be willing. He wasn’t, though.”</p><p> “Ask any one else?”</p><p> “I asked several other men, and one did</p><p> say he would if the price was right. I made</p><p> it right, and he agreed to come out the next</p><p> day and arrange things. But he didn’t</p><p> come, and when I saw him and asked him,</p><p> he said he’d changed his mind and wouldn’t</p><p> buy at any price.”</p><p> “Who might this changeable jigger be?”</p><p> Henderson asked softly.</p><p> “His name is Lafe Scattergood.”</p><p> “Oh, Lafe. Yeah, I know Lafe by sight.</p><p> What is yore iron, ma’am—yore brand?”</p><p> “The Lazy T, left hip, cows and horses.”</p><p> “I see. Well, yuh’d better go in the</p><p> hotel now, an’ don’t think no more o’ what’s</p><p> happened.”</p><p> “What are you going to do?” she asked</p><p> quietly.</p><p> “Why nothin’, nothin’ a-tall. I-”</p><p> “You mustn’t pick a quarrel with</p><p> Bellows. I forbid you to.”</p><p> “I didn’t say I was gonna-”</p><p> “You don’t have to say it. I know</p><p> exactly what’s in your mind. You mustn’t</p><p> shoot him.”</p><p> “But, ma’am, they’s nothin’ else to do</p><p> with a party like that.”</p><p> “Never mind. You’ve warned him, that’s</p><p> enough.”</p><p> “S’pose now he don’t believe in warnin’s,”</p><p> suggested hopeful Henderson.</p><p> “You’ll have to wait till—till he does</p><p> something. I couldn’t bear it if you killed</p><p> him on my account, unless-”</p><p> She hesitated.</p><p> “Yeah? Unless?”</p><p> “Unless it were absolutely necessary,</p><p> and it isn’t necessary now. You yourself</p><p> can see that. You must promise me not</p><p> to do anything to him till he gives you a</p><p> reason.”</p><p> “He has already.”</p><p> “Do you promise?”</p><p> “All right.” Sulkily.</p><p> “This means you mustn’t go out of your</p><p>way to seek a quarrel.” </p><p> “All right, I won’t. But if he comes</p><p>huntin’ one with me, that’s a heap dif- </p><p>ferent.” </p><p> “Of course. You’re the judge in that</p><p>case. You’re awfully good, Mr. Hen- </p><p>derson. I like you. You’re—you’re nice.” </p><p> She stood up quickly, seized his big hand</p><p>where it hung over his knee, pressed it </p><p>tightly between her warm palms, and was </p><p>gone. </p><p> Henderson got to his feet in a daze.</p><p>He lifted the hand she had pressed and </p><p>inspected it closely, front and back. </p><p> “My Gawd!” he wliispered in an awed</p><p>tone. “My Gawd!” </p><p>CHUCK MORGAN was finishing </p><p>his fifth cup of coffee when Hen- </p><p>derson joined him in the Canton. </p><p> “I didn’t do no waitin’ in the Starlight,”</p><p>remarked Chuck with a wink. “I kind o’ </p><p>thought you’d forget about it.” </p><p> “Shore did. When yuh get through</p><p>gugglin’ that coffee, pass me the bread. </p><p>Me, I could eat a raw dog. Howdy, Sing </p><p>Luey. How about a small steak with lots </p><p>o’ gravy, ’taters fried thick an’ canned </p><p>com?” </p><p> The inscrutable Sing Luey inclined a</p><p>grave head and padded kitchenward, hurl- </p><p>ing ahead of him a long string of clicking </p><p>Chinese. </p><p> “Sounds like bustin’ boxes,” criticized</p><p>Chuck. </p><p> “Don’t,” whispered Henderson, dealing</p><p>Chuck’s ankle a hearty kick beneath the </p><p>table. “He’s all right, an’ he’s a friend o’ </p><p>mine.” </p><p> “Even if he is, yuh don’t have to break</p><p>my leg, yuh - mule,” snarled Chuck, </p><p>upsetting a glass of water into Henderson’s </p><p>lap. “Now we’re even, an’ you keep yore </p><p>hoofs at home. Here, don’t glom all the </p><p>butter! I was figurin’ on another piece </p><p>o’ bread.” </p><p> “G’wan, yo’re stuffed like a guess-hawg</p><p>now,” replied Henderson, serenely troweling </p><p>on the butter. “Pass the sugar so’s I can </p><p>sand down this dobie. Try it. She’s </p><p>good thisaway.” </p><p> “I might if they was any butter,” Chuck</p><p>flung back, and consoled himself with a </p><p>cigaret. </p><p> After supper Henderson and Chuck went</p><p>High Pockets </p><p>39 </p><p>out into the night, and by devious ways </p><p>approached the dance-hall. They did not </p><p>enter. They lay full-length upon the </p><p>gentle slope of the lean-to attached to </p><p>Dolan’s warehouse, and looked in through </p><p>an open window. It was a window of fair </p><p>size. They could see the full length of the </p><p>bar, the greater part of the dancing-floor, </p><p>and the people respectively thereat and </p><p>thereon. </p><p> Henderson followed with hard, gloomy</p><p>eyes the gyrations of the five demi-mon- </p><p>daines. </p><p> “I’d shore admire to know which o’</p><p>them Jezebels now-” </p><p> He did not complete the muttered</p><p>sentence. </p><p> “Take yore choice,” whispered Chuck.</p><p>■	“Guess I’ll have to. Yuh can’t tell a</p><p>- thing by lookin’ at ’em. An’ yuh </p><p>''can’t talk to ’em now without they’d </p><p>start guessin’ what yuh was drivin’ at.” </p><p>“Yuh done told me most o’ that before,” </p><p>fleered Chuck. </p><p> “Yore memory’s improvin’. First thing</p><p>you know, yuh’ll be growin’ a crop o’ </p><p>brains, then maybe yuh’ll be some help </p><p>to a feller an’—djever see that specimen be- </p><p>fore—jigger just come in—leather chaps?” </p><p>“Shore. Name’s Sam Bellows. Rides </p><p>for the 88.” </p><p> “Now?”</p><p> “Did last I heard. This is the first I</p><p> seen of him for six months. He’s a ring-</p><p> tail hellion, if you ask me.”</p><p> “He looks it.”</p><p> “Don’t he?”</p><p> The poor creature, Snakebite, was</p><p>shambling across the barroom. He bumped </p><p>by chance the shoulder of Bellows. </p><p>Instantly that evil-tempered character</p><p>knocked Snakebite flat. Swearing hor- </p><p>ribly Bellows proceeded to kick the scrab- </p><p>bling Snakebite across the floor and through </p><p>the doorway into the street. Which having </p><p>been accomplished to his satisfaction Bel- </p><p>lows advanced to the bar, loudly inviting </p><p>all and sundry to join him in liquor. </p><p> “Told yuh he was mama’s own darling,”</p><p>whispered Chuck. “Five minutes with </p><p>gentle Sam makes a hoss headshy for life. </p><p>When it comes to plumb hound-meanness </p><p>thataway he’s got a Piute lookin’ like a </p><p>silver saint.” </p><p> “Will he stand the acid?”</p><p> “Every time. He’s got guts, I’ll say</p><p>that for Sam.” </p><p> “A reg’lar, shore-’nough bad-man, huh?”</p><p> “Y’betcha.”</p><p> “Ain’t nobody ever crawled his hump?”</p><p> “Two to my knowledge.”</p><p> “At the same time?”</p><p> “Different times. Him an’ ‘Skeeter’</p><p>Riley had a argument in the 88 bunk-house </p><p>last Winter. They buried Riley next day.. </p><p>After the Spring round-up when the outfits </p><p>was all in town Sam got into a game o’ </p><p>stud with ‘Slim’ Berdan—he was marshal </p><p>then, Slim was—an’ some other fellers. </p><p>Which that game shore wound up in the </p><p>smoke. The marshal’s cashed, an’ Sam’s </p><p>done it.” </p><p> “A marshal! She’s a wonder this active</p><p>party wasn’t lynched instanter. Whatsa </p><p>matter with this town?” </p><p> “Well, yuh see, the marshal wasn’t in</p><p>the game official-like. He’s just playin’ </p><p>to pass the time an’ be friendly, an’ every- </p><p>body heard him call Sam a liar, so she’s </p><p>just another even break. After that last </p><p>fraycas nobody gets familiar none with </p><p>Sam.” </p><p> “Yeah,” muttered Henderson, “yeah.</p><p>Le’s wander. Lookin’ at them painted </p><p>floozies makes me sick. It ain’t a-bit </p><p>o’ help. I’d have to wring their necks to </p><p>find out anythin’. Le’s go down to the</p><p>Starlight an’ run a blazer on the barkeep. </p><p>He’s funny.” </p><p>CHAPTER XII </p><p>HENDERSON MOVES </p><p>TT WAS long past midnight when Chuck, </p><p>sleeping lightly, was awakened by the </p><p>pressure of Henderson’s fingers on his </p><p>wrist. </p><p> “ ’Tsall right, Chuck, lay quiet,” whis-</p><p>pered Henderson, his mouth close to </p><p>Chuck’s ear lest their fellow-guests in the </p><p>room be awakened. “I gotta slide out </p><p>for a li’l while. Begone a week maybe.” </p><p>“Whatcha gonna do?” asked Chuck, </p><p>fearful that he might miss some excitement. </p><p> “Nemmine what I’m gonna do. I ain’t</p><p>none sure myself yet. Tell yuh when I get </p><p>back. You don’t have to stay here. All I </p><p>want yuh to do is pay Lainey my board— </p><p>here’s the money—an’ have him ’tend to </p><p>my gray hoss. I dunno just what to do </p><p>about Miss Blythe.” He broke off and </p><p>scratched his guileful head. “This Sam </p><p>Bellows has sort o’ been annoyin’ her, I </p><p>40 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>guess. I warned him off, an’ he took it.” </p><p>“He did!” The astonished Chuck raised </p><p>himself on his elbow. “You never told </p><p>me.” </p><p> “My memory’s bad. Lay still, for</p><p>Gawd’s sake! No need o’ wakin’ the </p><p>neighbors. I was thinkin’ with me gone </p><p>Bellows might get to actin’ up. Maybe </p><p>yuh’d better pass the word to Jake an’ </p><p>Kansas to sort o’ look-out her game while </p><p>Sam’s ’round.” </p><p> “ ’Taint necessary,” Chuck said stiffly.</p><p>“I’m here. I ain’t no child. I got a li’l </p><p>gun myself. You needn’t think yo’re the </p><p>only he-man in the Territory.” </p><p> “Now that’s right friendly, Chuck,”</p><p>commended Henderson, precisely as if he </p><p>had not known that his friend would rise </p><p>to the occasion. “Yuh’ll shore help me a </p><p>lot thataway. Where’s Willie’s Old- </p><p>Brother-in-Law livin’ now?” </p><p> “On the Lazy, at the mouth o’ Soogan.</p><p>He moved camp there from some’ers up </p><p>Packsaddle about two weeks ago.” </p><p> “Then he’s there yet. So long.”</p><p>Henderson, carrying his boots under one </p><p>arm, his war-bags under the other, tiptoed </p><p>from the room. He opened a dining-room </p><p>window, leaned out and deposited boots </p><p>and war-bags on the ground. His saddle, </p><p>blanket and bridle, followed the war-bags. </p><p>Henderson followed the saddle, closed the </p><p>window noiselessly, and, resembling nothing </p><p>so much as a laden Christmas tree, made </p><p>his silent way to the corral. </p><p> The moonlight enabled him to catch up</p><p>his yellow horse without much trouble. </p><p>But he was forced to ear the animal in order </p><p>to bridle him. Once the bit was between </p><p>the yellow’s jaws the rest was easy. It was </p><p>not the pony’s custom to fight the saddle. </p><p> Henderson led the yellow out, put up</p><p>the bars of the gate, mounted, and walked </p><p>his horse to the street. Here he turned </p><p>southward and struck into the Marysville </p><p>trail. The yellow horse began to single- </p><p>foot, the easy gait which eats up the long </p><p>miles as fire eats the grass.</p><p> The rising sun met horse and rider</p><p>paralleling the marching skirmish lines of </p><p>cottonwoods fringing the course of Soogan </p><p>Creek, not ten miles from where that </p><p>shallow stream empties into the Lazy </p><p>River. An hour and a half later Hen- </p><p>derson topped a long ridge and saw, a short </p><p>quarter-mile beyond his horse’s ears, the </p><p>long, broad reaches of the Lazy River. </p><p>In the lush grass on the triangular flat </p><p>between the northern bank of the Lazy and </p><p>the eastern bank of Soogan Creek a horse- </p><p>band was grazing. At the apex of the </p><p>triangle were the lodges of the Rainbow’s </p><p>people. </p><p> There were four lodges, three large and</p><p>one small. For Willie’s Old-Brother-in- </p><p>Law was a man of family and substance. </p><p>The family comprised one wife, her two </p><p>grandmothers, his two grandmothers, five </p><p>assorted aunts, divers children belonging </p><p>to the aunts, and his niece, the Rainbow. </p><p>The substance consisted of ninety or a </p><p>hundred ponies, many skins, dressed and </p><p>undressed, and two dozen dogs. The </p><p>latter could not be termed an asset. </p><p> The camp, of human life, lay deserted to</p><p>the eye when Henderson rode in. But the </p><p>dogs made him vociferously not welcome. </p><p> “Might know she wouldn’t be here!'-'</p><p>exclaimed Henderson, controlling with diffi- </p><p>culty his agitated horse. </p><p> “That depends,” said the Rainbow,</p><p>suddenly appearing between the flaps of </p><p>the smallest lodge. “What she in par- </p><p>ticular are you looking for, Mister Hen- </p><p>derson?” </p><p> “Yoreself,” he told her, grinning.</p><p>“That’s nice. The family’s gone fishing, </p><p>and I’m left sucking my thumbs and dying </p><p>for a man to talk to. You’ll do quite well. </p><p>Git, you devils!” </p><p> The order was directed at the dogs.</p><p>It was accompanied by an accurate stick </p><p>of firewood that solidly thumped the nearest </p><p>cur in the short ribs. The pack fled </p><p>howling. </p><p> “They’ll be good now for a while,” she</p><p>observed, smiling widely. “Light and rest</p><p>your hat, old-timer. I think I’ll call you </p><p>Bill. Mister Henderson is so formal.” </p><p>“Help yourself.” </p><p> “I always do. Had any breakfast?”</p><p> “Now howja know?”</p><p> “Men are always hungry. How do</p><p>jerky and beans, Old Mexico style, strike </p><p>you? I'll heat ’em up.” </p><p> “Nemmine about heatin’ ’em. I like</p><p>’em cold.” </p><p> “You are hungry. Cold it is. But I</p><p>will make coffee. I could drink another </p><p>cup myself. Turn your horse out and be </p><p>happy.” </p><p> Henderson fashioned a rope halter with</p><p>expert fingers, and picketed the yellow </p><p>horse with a thirty-foot sweep. This lest </p><p>High Pockets </p><p>41 </p><p>the overheated animal drink himself into </p><p>a state of foundered uselessness. Then </p><p>Henderson unsaddled and returned to the </p><p>Rainbow and food. </p><p> “Still like Joy as much as ever?” asked</p><p>the Rainbow, when she had filled his plate </p><p>with beans a second time. </p><p> “She’s one nice girl,” he parried.</p><p> “Isn’t she? You didn’t answer my</p><p>question, though. But you needn’t. I </p><p>can tell by your ears. They’re all red under </p><p>the tan.” </p><p> “Are you busy now, Miss Rainbow?”</p><p> “I will be in about ten seconds if you</p><p>don’t drop the ‘Miss.’ Lord, you con- </p><p>founded men give me a pain! The fresh </p><p>ones are too fresh, and the nice ones are </p><p>too-nice. It’s a dog’s life, being a girl. </p><p>What do you want anyway?” </p><p> “Help. I’m needin’ it bad.”</p><p> “So you come galloping straight to the</p><p>Rainbow for it. All right, tell sister.” </p><p> He told—at great length. The Rainbow</p><p>listened with shining eyes and flattering </p><p>attention. </p><p> “Can yuh get yore uncle to chime in, do</p><p>yuh think?” Henderson asked anxiously, </p><p>in conclusion. </p><p> “I know I can,” declared the Rainbow.</p><p>“He’ll do anything for me, uncle will. </p><p>Don’t worry about that for a minute. </p><p>It’s all fixed. You’d better give me a </p><p>letter.” </p><p> “I was goin’ to. I got paper an’ a</p><p>pencil in my war-bags. I’ll get ’em.” </p><p>CHAPTER Xin </p><p>EXCESSIVELY DIRTY WORK </p><p>TWENTY-FOUR hours later Henderson </p><p>was nearing the Blythe homestead on</p><p>Calf Creek, known locally as the Twin </p><p>Springs. Henderson’s movements, for the </p><p>last several miles, had been furtive. He </p><p>rode the draws and regarded the landscape </p><p>warily. </p><p> A scant half-mile from the Springs he</p><p>dismounted between two short, steep-sided </p><p>hillocks spattered with a careless growth of </p><p>jack-pine. He anchored his horse to a </p><p>pine, took from his off saddlebag a pair of </p><p>well-kept field-glasses and climbed the </p><p>higher of the two hillocks. </p><p> The last few yards of the ascent he made</p><p>on his hands and knees. Arriving at the </p><p>top he removed his hat, lay down full- </p><p>length beneath a jack-pine, and focused </p><p>his glasses on the Blythe house and the </p><p>environs thereof. </p><p> A haze of yellow dust was over the</p><p>Blythe corral. A thin gray smoke as- </p><p>cended from the middle of the corral. </p><p>Across the windless air came faintly to his </p><p>ears the bawling of an indignant cow. </p><p>Henderson’s mouth, beneath the stubby </p><p>mustache, straightened to a white line. </p><p> “Somebody ain’t losin’ a bit o’ time,”</p><p>he observed with wrath. “An’ I guess </p><p>I better not lose any either.” </p><p> He returned hurriedly to his horse,</p><p>loosed the reins, and mounted without </p><p>touching the stirrup. The yellow horse </p><p>knew what signified that flying mount. </p><p>He laid back his ears, tucked in his tail, </p><p>and snapped at the bit. </p><p> “Slide, feller, slide,” rapped out Hender-</p><p>son, srnking his spurs. “Split the breeze.” </p><p> He whirled his quirt cross-handed and</p><p>cut the yellow horse again and again </p><p>behind the rear cinch. The yellow flat- </p><p>tened out and flew. He had rolled many </p><p>miles behind him since leaving Farewell, </p><p>and he was tired, but he was not yet done. </p><p>He responded to spurs and quirt with </p><p>every ounce of strength in his tough </p><p>muscles. </p><p> Taking advantage of natural cover in</p><p>the shape of two dry washes and the </p><p>inevitable cottonwoods on the creek bank, </p><p>Henderson ran his horse to within four</p><p>hundred yards of the house. Profanely </p><p>praising the blessed fact that the house </p><p>lay between him and the corral, he checked </p><p>his mount, dismounted and knotted the </p><p>reins ’round a tree’s slim bole. </p><p> He dragged a Winchester from the</p><p>scabbard under the right fender and went </p><p>forward on foot. No Indian could have </p><p>moved more quietly than did Henderson </p><p>as he slipped through the cottonwoods </p><p>toward that place where smoke mingled </p><p>with dusty haze and cattle bawled their </p><p>protests. </p><p> Tim Blythe had cleared away the trees</p><p>on the creek bank in front of the house </p><p>and for a space of twenty yards on either </p><p>hand. Where the cover ended Henderson </p><p>paused and crouched behind a red willow. </p><p> Between the willow branches Henderson</p><p>could see a goodly part of the corral stock- </p><p>ade where it projected beyond the house. </p><p>And the smoke of the fire was plainly </p><p>visible above the stockade. </p><p>42 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Henderson waited until a sharp, sudden</p><p>bawl proclaimed the laying on of a hot iron. </p><p>Then, while the attention of the men in the </p><p>corral was concentrated on the work in </p><p>hand, he slipped like a shadow across the </p><p>open ground and gained the shelter of the </p><p>house. </p><p> He dropped on his knees, crawled rapidly</p><p>’round the house on all fours, and hugged </p><p>the wall at one corner. With all care he </p><p>poked forth his hatless head and recon- </p><p>noitered. One of Henderson’s winning </p><p>traits was the faculty of swift and all- </p><p>embracing observation. Under the cir- </p><p>cumstances a bare glance was sufficient. </p><p>He withdrew his head and squatted back </p><p>on his heels. </p><p> He had seen that the gate of the corral</p><p>was distant not thirty ’yards, that there </p><p>were at least a score of cows within the </p><p>enclosure, and that upon one hog-tied </p><p>member of the band two men were operating </p><p>with a heavy iron and a wet blanket. The </p><p>two men were the Marysville marshal and </p><p>Mr. Eliphalet Scattergood, the latter well </p><p>and unfavorably known among his kind as </p><p>Lafe. </p><p> “I wonder if they’s any more,” pondered</p><p>Henderson. “I couldn’t see only two </p><p>ponies.” </p><p> The question was important. Henderson</p><p>worked his crabwise way to the rear of the </p><p>house and looked in through a window. </p><p>There was no one in that room, the kitchen. </p><p>It was a three-room house. Within sixty </p><p>seconds Henderson was satisfied that the </p><p>domicile was untenanted. He returned to </p><p>the corner from which he had spied upon </p><p>the dusty gentlemen in the corral, and </p><p>leaned his rifle against the log wall. </p><p> “Just a li’l dirty work now,” he thought</p><p>brightly, “an’ everythin’ll be hunkydory.” </p><p> He took off the black and red polka-</p><p>dotted handkerchief that encircled his neck </p><p>and flattened it against a log. Then, </p><p>employing for the purpose his pocket- </p><p>knife, he jagged out three holes. Two </p><p>of these holes were on a line, the third </p><p>some inches below and between them.</p><p> The holes completed, Henderson put the</p><p>handkerchief over his face and head in such </p><p>a manner that he was enabled to see through </p><p>the upper holes and breathe through the </p><p>lower. Holding the handkerchief in place </p><p>Henderson settled his hat hard down on his </p><p>head. Experimentally he shook his head. </p><p>The handkerchief flapped at the bottom, </p><p>but the hat held the upper part firmly. </p><p>Henderson next removed his vest, turned </p><p>it inside out and put it on. After which </p><p>he pulled off his boots and set them upright </p><p>beside his rifle. </p><p> “I hope they ain’t too many stones,” he</p><p>whispered anxiously as he drew his two six- </p><p>shooters. </p><p> “Only three more,” observed the marshal</p><p>to his friend Mr. Scattergood, and tossed </p><p>a steaming blanket into a pail of water. </p><p> “An’ that’s one - good thing!”</p><p>declared Mr. Scattergood, his fingers busily </p><p>employed in releasing the feet of a cow. </p><p>“This ain’t no job for two men. Which </p><p>I never worked so hard in my life.” </p><p> “Keep on an’ you’ll shore work harder,</p><p>feller,” remarked a genial voice from the </p><p>corral gate. “I got a picture o’ you </p><p>breakin’ stone—that is, if y’ain’t lynched </p><p>previous.” </p><p> The backs of both men were toward the</p><p>gate. Neither man budged out of position, </p><p>nor did he move so much as a finger. The </p><p>marshal, in the act of scratching a match </p><p>on his trousers when the voice broke upon </p><p>his ears, balanced himself on one leg like a </p><p>crane. The kneeling, back-bent Mr. Scat- </p><p>tergood stared dumbly at the cow’s hoof </p><p>between his paralyzed hands. </p><p> “That’s right,” commended the voice</p><p>cheerily, “hold it an’ watch for the pretty </p><p>bird. A couple o’ clicks an’ yore picture’s </p><p>took.” </p><p> The unseen laughed with relish. The</p><p>marshal swayed slightly. It was the first </p><p>time he had ever been caught. </p><p> “You feller with the match, put yore leg</p><p>down an’ yore hands up,” went on the</p><p>voice. “The other jigger will stand up </p><p>slow, pushin’ his hands out in front of him </p><p>an’ turn my way.” </p><p>Bspt" THE marshal and Mr. Scattergood </p><p>IPjfc followed their instructions to the </p><p>letter. The latter, facing the gate, </p><p>saw a tall citizen, his face masked by a red </p><p>and black polka-dotted handkerchief, lean- </p><p>ing lazily over the bars. The masked </p><p>individual wore a peculiar-looking vest </p><p>without buttons, and his two six-shooters </p><p>bore directly upon Mr. Scattergood and </p><p>his friend, the marshal. </p><p> “The gent lookin’ at me will now un-</p><p>buckle his belt an’ let ’er drop,” said the </p><p>unknown. “He won’t be hurried about </p><p>it neither.” </p><p>High Pockets </p><p>43 </p><p> Mr. Scattergood’s hands set about their</p><p>task with stiff lack of haste. When his belt </p><p>and six-shooter were on the ground Mr. </p><p>Scattergood was ordered to wheel about </p><p>and put his hands up. With Mr. Scatter- </p><p>good faced to the rear in the posture of a </p><p>signaler sending the letter U, the tall </p><p>citizen began on the marshal. </p><p> “Turn loose yore belt an’ drop her, you</p><p>other feller,” were his words. “Then you </p><p>can turn ’round, too, first puttin’ up yore </p><p>hands.” </p><p> The marshal obeyed quite as meticu-</p><p>lously as had Mr. Scattergood. </p><p> “You ain’t wearin’ no star on that vest,”</p><p>complained the tall citizen. “Ain’t you </p><p>got no star?” </p><p> “No!” yapped the badgered marshal.</p><p>“That’s shore tough. I was hopin’ you </p><p>had one. I’m makin’ a collection o’ stars. </p><p>Don’tcha think now, if yuh tried real hard, </p><p>yuh could maybe dig up a li’l star out o’ </p><p>yore pockets—usin’ one hand, o’ course?” </p><p>“No!” barked the marshal. </p><p> “Don’t yell. Yuh hurt my feelin’s when</p><p>yuh do. An’ my feelin’s ’11 shore be dam- </p><p>aged if you don’t gimme a star. Yuh won’t </p><p>do no such thing, huh? I’m sorry.” </p><p> Bang! Smack! The tall citizen’s off-gun</p><p>spat flame and smoke. A bullet cut the </p><p>ground between the marshal’s feet. </p><p> “Turn yore right foot slanchways, feller,”</p><p>requested the tall citizen. “I’m gonna </p><p>shoot off yore boot-heel. Is yore ankle </p><p>insured? With my feelin’s all tore up an’ </p><p>jangled thisaway I might shoot high or </p><p>somethin’.” </p><p> “Don’t shoot!” begged the marshal.</p><p>“I’ll get it.” </p><p> He slowly lowered his right arm, pro-</p><p>duced from an upper vest-pocket an object </p><p>that glittered and held it out at arm’s </p><p>length. </p><p> “Drop her on yore belt. That’s the boy.</p><p>Now, both o’ yuh come over here quick!”</p><p>Mr. Scattergood and the marshal fran- </p><p>tically rushed the gate. </p><p> “ ’Taint necessary to climb over,”</p><p>drawled the unknown, backing away. </p><p>“They was a couple o’ cows gonna drift </p><p>in between us an’ I didn’t wanna lose sight </p><p>o’ yuh. You might ’a’ felt like gamblin’ </p><p>with me. Ain’t it amazin’,” he added in </p><p>his pleasant voice,” how easy yuh can </p><p>change the Lazy T into the Barred </p><p>Box?” </p><p> The two worthies behind the gate</p><p>glowered. The marshal spat upon the </p><p>dusty earth. </p><p> “I s’pose yuh was figurin’ on drivin’ over</p><p>to the Dry Mountains,” went on the tall </p><p>citizen, “an’ sellin’ ’em for beef to the </p><p>miner folks. Was that the idea? Don’t </p><p>say nothin’ if yuh don’t wanna. I’m a </p><p>good guesser. Twenty-two cows in here. </p><p>That leaves twenty out on the range. Have </p><p>yuh blotted their brands yet? Well, it </p><p>don’t matter. It’s none o’ my business. </p><p>I’m only a poor lonesome road-agent, but </p><p>I never robbed no women yet. Yo’re a </p><p>couple o’ skunks, ain’tcha? They ain’t </p><p>nothin’ worse’n a skunk, is they—’cept you </p><p>two gents? Yo’re so low down a rattle- </p><p>snake sticks up over yuh like afreight- </p><p>wagon over a couple o’ toads.” </p><p> “You go to-!” snarled Mr. Scatter-</p><p>good. </p><p> “Before I do,” said their unruffled</p><p>captor, “s’pose you go over an’ get yore </p><p>two ponies. Get the one that’s stilt- </p><p>holdin’ the cow first. An’ don’t go foolin’ </p><p>for no Winchester while yo’re lettin’ loose </p><p>that rope, an’ don’t dodge behind no cow.” </p><p>Mr. Scattergood did as he was told. </p><p>When he returned, leading the two ponies, </p><p>the marshal was ordered to open the gate. </p><p> “C’mon out now,” directed the unknown.</p><p>“Yuh might swing the gate shut again, you. </p><p>The coyote holdin’ the hosses will tie ’em </p><p>to the top rail. The other polecat will </p><p>walk out into the clear about forty steps </p><p>an’ stop without turnin’ ’round. Drift, </p><p>an’ drift quick! Through with them </p><p>ponies? All right. You trot out after </p><p>yore friend an’ kick him in the pants.” </p><p>Which fantastic order caused the marshal</p><p>to half-turn and Mr. Scattergood to stare </p><p>in slack-jawed amazement. </p><p> “Yuh heard what I said,” the tall citizen</p><p>drawled. “Fly at it. I ain’t searched you </p><p>fellers for hide-outs, so I’m takin’ a chance. </p><p>But I’ll keep my peepers open, don’tcha </p><p>fret. Get a-goin’, you hop-toad, get a-goin’. </p><p>An’ kick him good so’s I can hear it.” </p><p> One of the unknown’s two guns cracked</p><p>as he spoke. Mr. Scatlergood’s hat </p><p>twitched and two round holes appeared in </p><p>the high crown. </p><p> “Start, I’m tellin’ yuh,” continued the</p><p>tall citizen, “or will I have to part yore </p><p>hair?” </p><p> Thus adjured and encouraged Mr. Scat-</p><p>tergood did not linger. He walked right </p><p>out, swung his leg and dealt the marshal a </p><p>44 </p><p>.Adventure </p><p>sincere and hearty kick. The marshal </p><p>grunted and shuffled his feet. </p><p> “Now, Marshal,” whooped the' tall citi-</p><p> zen, “whatcha gonna do? Gonna take it</p><p> lyin’ down? G’wan! Hit him! Whang</p><p> him good! I’m tellin’ yuh to! Show me a</p><p> fight, you two gents!”</p><p> The stung marshal whirled on his toes</p><p>and pasted Mr. Scattergood squarely on </p><p>the nose. Not to be outdone, Mr. Scatter- </p><p>good jolted the marshal in the stomach. </p><p>The marshal bored in with flailing arms. </p><p>Mr. Scattergood met him less than half- </p><p>way and closed the official left eye. The </p><p>marshal, running true to form, descended </p><p>to the low tactics of the hoodlum and </p><p>kicked Mr. Scattergood in the shins. </p><p>Snarling with rage Mr. Scattergood swung </p><p>his right to the marshal’s mouth and </p><p>repeated with his left. </p><p> Spitting blood and teeth the marshal</p><p>closed with his companion in misery and </p><p>‘•endeavored to choke him. Mr. Scatter- </p><p>good contrived to grip a double handful of </p><p>the marshal’s hair. Mr. Scattergood ripped </p><p>and tore. The marshal, suffering the most </p><p>exquisite pain, strove to gouge Mr. Scatter- </p><p>good, but only succeeded in removing a </p><p>three-inch strip of skin from above Mr. </p><p>Scattergood’s left eyebrow. </p><p> Mr. Scattergood hooked his heel behind</p><p> the marshal’s leg. Both men fell to the</p><p> ground, the marshal underneath. In the</p><p> fall the marshal’s hair was wrenched free.</p><p> Incidentally some of it was wrenched out.</p><p> Promptly the marshal wound both arms</p><p> ’round the neck of Mr. Scattergood and</p><p> twisted his own body to one side. The</p><p> tangled pair flopped over with a jerk. Mr.</p><p> Scattergood was now underneath.</p><p> The marshal drove his knee into the solar</p><p> plexus of Mr. Scattergood. The latter</p><p> went limp with a wheeze. Kneeling upon</p><p> the senseless form of Mr. Scattergood, the</p><p> victorious marshal, out of his one service-</p><p> able eye, looked about him for a rock with</p><p> which to further dent the features of his</p><p> comrade. An ancient friendship had in-</p><p> deed been shattered.</p><p> At this (juncture long ■fingers inserted</p><p> themselves between the collar of the</p><p> marshal and his neck. He was yanked</p><p> backward and flung down in a huddle.</p><p> He sat up, acutely conscious that he ached</p><p> in all parts of him, and waggled an abraded</p><p> chin. The masked citizen, sitting back on</p><p> his heels a few yards away, surveyed the</p><p>puffed and battered countenance of the </p><p>marshal. </p><p> “I ain’t got no kick cornin’ a-tall,” said</p><p>the unknown. “I dunno when I’ve seen </p><p>a better fight. You fellers done well,- </p><p>well. I didn’t think yuh had it in yuh, </p><p>honest I didn’t. Yuh needn’t go to get up </p><p>after yore hat now. Just sit still till yore </p><p>friend pulls ’round. He’ll be all right in a </p><p>shake. He’s breathin’ better already.” </p><p>CHAPTER XIV </p><p>THE BARGAIN </p><p>THE tall citizen shepherded the two </p><p>staggering men to their horses. </p><p> “I’ve took the rifles off o’ yore saddles</p><p>so’s yuh won’t be tempted,” he said. </p><p>“Now,” he went on, when they had made </p><p>their very clumsy mounts, “start off slow— </p><p>no, this way. I wanna be able to watch </p><p>yuh while I’m pullin’ on my boots. After </p><p>yuh get across Calf Creek, head east for </p><p>them hills. She’s five miles across that flat. </p><p>An’ I’d go straight across if I was you. </p><p>I’ve got a cayuse cached ’round here, an’ </p><p>I might come after yuh an’ show yuh the </p><p>way if yuh forget an’ drift north or south. </p><p>After yuh get to the hills I don’t give a- </p><p>whatcha do. I’m goin’ some’ers else myself </p><p>pretty prompt. I hear this country ain’t </p><p>healthy for road-agents—or brand-blot- </p><p>ters.” </p><p> The two thoroughly chastened men made</p><p>no remark. They rode down to the creek, </p><p>splashed across, and headed toward the </p><p>distant hills. The tall citizen, pulling on </p><p>his boots, watched them go. Not till they </p><p>were three hundred yards away did he </p><p>remove his handkerchief mask. He knotted </p><p>it ’round his neck, turned his vest, and</p><p>built himself a cigaret. </p><p> “I’m bettin’ them two jiggers will be in</p><p>Marysville tomorrow,” Henderson said </p><p>aloud. “Yessir, I’m shore gamblin’ on </p><p>that. An’ they won’t be expectin’ to meet </p><p>no road-agent neither.” </p><p> He went into the corral, took from the</p><p>pail the soaked blanket and wrung it out. </p><p>He retrieved the marshal’s star and put it </p><p>in an inside vest-pocket. He up-ended the </p><p>pail over the fire and gathered up the belts </p><p>with their dangling six-shooters and the </p><p>heavy running-iron used by the men in </p><p>their brand-blotting, and dumped the </p><p>articles into the blanket. He folded the </p><p>High Pockets </p><p>45 </p><p>blanket over and over till he had a compact </p><p>bundle. </p><p> He dropped the bundle beside his</p><p>Winchester and picked up the rifles he </p><p>had taken from the two men. He scouted </p><p>’round the house till he found a small </p><p>opening between a foundation log and the </p><p>ground. Through this opening he shoved </p><p>the rifles one after the other at the full </p><p>stretch of his arm. He threw several hand- </p><p>fuls of earth into the opening, and tamped </p><p>with a vigorous boot-toe. </p><p> “Them rifles may not be needed,” he</p><p>reflected, “but a extra ace in a deal like this </p><p>ain’t to be sneezed at.” </p><p> He returned to the front of the house</p><p>and gazed across the flats. The retreating </p><p>figures, of the marshal and Mr. Scattergood </p><p>were dots in the distance. They were </p><p>keeping a remarkably straight course. </p><p> “Guess I’ll get the li’l hoss,” said Hen-</p><p>derson, “so’s I can turn loose these cows. </p><p>No use waitin’ no longer.” </p><p> He picked up the blanket bundle and his</p><p>rifle and walked swiftly back to his horse. </p><p>He awakened the dozing animal, tied the </p><p>bundle into his slicker, swung up and </p><p>trotted to the corral. He opened the gate </p><p>without dismounting and rode in. He </p><p>drove out every cow. Whirling a doubled </p><p>rope and yelling at the top of his lungs he </p><p>drove those cows west and north. He </p><p>spent an active hour, and when he ceased </p><p>to shout and spur the cattle were scattered </p><p>in the draws and hollows of a region several </p><p>miles square. </p><p> “Nothin’ like scatterin’ the evidence</p><p>where they won’t find it in a hurry, is they?” </p><p>he inquired of the horse. “C’mon, feller, </p><p>we’ll go back to the creek an’ give yuh one </p><p>fine li’l drink, an’ then me’n you’ll sift along </p><p>to Marysville.” </p><p> The stars were out when Henderson rode</p><p>his tired horse into Marysville. He dis- </p><p>mounted in front of Judge Allison’s house. </p><p>The judge was standing on the porch. </p><p>Henderson could see the white gleam of his </p><p>shirt-sleeves.</p><p> “It’s me, Judge,” he said, stepping upon</p><p>the porch, “Bill Henderson.” </p><p> “With the accent on the Henderson,”</p><p>whispered the judge, gripping his hand </p><p>warmly. “I’ll have Black Sam attend to </p><p>your horse. You’ll stay with me, of </p><p>course.” </p><p> “It might look better if I stayed at the</p><p>hotel, Judge,” said Henderson softly. </p><p> “So that’s it. I might have known.</p><p>You’ll eat with me, though. I shan’t take </p><p>‘No’ on that.” </p><p> “Well, I’ve always liked yore grub,</p><p>Judge. I’ll be right back soon’s I go to </p><p>the hotel an’ get me a bed an’ see the li’l </p><p>hoss fed. I got a small pack here I’d like </p><p>to leave with yuh, an’ I wouldn’t want for </p><p>nobody to see it.” </p><p> “I’ll put it in the sideboard where I keep</p><p>my whisky. The doors are always locked. </p><p>This it?” </p><p> Henderson handed the blanket bundle</p><p>to the judge. </p><p> “Kind o’ damp an’ heavy,” he cautioned,</p><p>and returned to his waiting horse. </p><p> He left his mount at the hotel corral,</p><p>bespoke horse-feed, and made good his </p><p>claim to a bed by the simple method of </p><p>piling his war-bags on an unoccupied </p><p>cot. </p><p> As he passed through the barroom on his</p><p>way to the street a man entered. It was </p><p>Dunlavy, the Wells Fargo agent. </p><p> “When’s Sam Bellows cornin’ back?”</p><p>Dunlavy asked the bartender. </p><p> “I dunno,” replied the bartender.</p><p>Henderson sat down on a chair, and </p><p>slowly rolled a cigaret. </p><p> “Didn’t he say?” persisted Dunlavy.</p><p> “If he had I’d tell yuh. Sam drifted, an’</p><p>I dumio even where.” </p><p> “Well, they’s a saddle, bridle, spurs, an’</p><p>a pair o’ Angora chaps—leastwise that’s</p><p>what the bill says—in the office for him. </p><p>Come in on the stage today from Pueblo, </p><p>Colorado.” </p><p> “Blazier’s, huh?”</p><p> “Yes, an’ the bill says ‘collect,’ an’ I’d</p><p>like to.” </p><p> “Yuh needn’t look at me thataway,”</p><p>grinned the bartender, swabbing off the </p><p>bar. “Yuh won’t do no collectin’ here.” </p><p>Dunlavy departed swearing. Henderson </p><p>smoked his cigaret to the butt, bought </p><p>some cigars for his friend, the judge, and </p><p>went out into the street and walked un- </p><p>hurriedly to the latter’s house. </p><p> “Judge,” said Henderson, when Black</p><p>Sam had served the supper, and the kitchen </p><p>door was shut, “I might want to ask a favor </p><p>of yuh tomorrow.” </p><p> “Say when,” smiled the judge.</p><p> “I might ask a couple o’ fellers in here</p><p>so’s I can talk to ’em private-like.” </p><p> “The house is yours.” Judge Allison</p><p>waved a plump and hospitable hand. </p><p>46 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “I’m obliged. I might be needin’ the</p><p>key to that sideboard, too.” </p><p> “Here’s a duplicate,” said the judge,</p><p>detaching a key from a clinking bunch and </p><p>tossing it across the table. </p><p> “An’ this ain’t all,” went on Henderson,</p><p>pocketing the key. “I’d sort o’ like yuh </p><p>to be in yore office across the hall while I’m </p><p>talkin’ to them fellers. I might wanna ask </p><p>yore advice.” </p><p> The judge cocked a heavy eyebrow and</p><p>tapped the dull butt of one of two six- </p><p>shooters in shoulder-holsters that cuddled </p><p>his ribs beneath his armpits. </p><p> “No.” Henderson shook his head and</p><p>dropped an eyelid. “Legal advice.” </p><p>“Sometimes I wish I was not a judge,” </p><p>grieved the jurist, “or that Justice was not </p><p>supposed to be blind. Are you planning </p><p>anything illegal? Never mind,” he added </p><p>hastily. “Don’t tell me. I’d rather not </p><p>know. But if you have in view a smoky </p><p>session, wouldn’t the corral do as well? I </p><p>dislike to seem discourteous or lacking in </p><p>hospitality, but—I rather value the mirror </p><p>in my sideboard.” </p><p> “I’m gamblin’ they won’t be no smoke,”</p><p>Henderson assured him. “Leastwise not if </p><p>I can help it.” </p><p> “I know you’ll do your best, Bill. Have</p><p>some more coffee? No? Well then, have </p><p>a drink. That whisky came to me from </p><p>Louisville a month ago. It’s thirty years </p><p>old, smooth as honey and mellow as a </p><p>ripe Sheepnose.” </p><p> “Thank you, I will have a little nip.”</p><p>Later in the evening Henderson and the </p><p>judge strolled into the Bound-to-Come </p><p>Saloon, whose enterprising proprietor, keen </p><p>to provide the honest dollar with other </p><p>than a liquid outlet, ran games in the back </p><p>room. </p><p> The judge inserted his ample bulk in a</p><p>game of stud. </p><p> Henderson did not play. He moved</p><p>aimlessly about, when he wasn’t talking to</p><p>the bartender, and drifted into the street </p><p>before eleven o’clock. </p><p> From the Bound-to-Come he went to the</p><p>Thanksgiving, where likewise men could </p><p>drink or play cards as the spirit moved </p><p>them. Here again Henderson did not pick </p><p>up a hand, and here again he held casual </p><p>converse with the bartender. </p><p> Before midnight was thirty minutes old</p><p>Henderson was asleep on his cot at the </p><p>hotel. </p><p>IN THE morning he repaired to the </p><p>office of the judge and borrowed </p><p>paper, pen and ink. He consumed </p><p>the better part of an hour in filling several </p><p>sheets of legal cap with spacious hand- </p><p>writing. </p><p> He read through his completed work with</p><p>care, decided that he had been sufficiently </p><p>specific, and made two meticulous copies. </p><p>Which being done he signed the lot, placed </p><p>original and copies in three separate en- </p><p>velopes and handed them to the judge. </p><p> “If I ain’t back by ten o’clock,” said</p><p>Henderson, “or if anythin’ happens to me </p><p>before, yuh might open one o’ them en- </p><p>velopes an’ read what’s inside.” </p><p> “Right,” smiled Judge Allison, and</p><p>pigeon-holed the envelopes. </p><p> From the judge’s house Henderson went</p><p>to the general store of Mr. Eliphalet Scat- </p><p>tergood. The owner was assisting his clerk </p><p>in the unpacking of sundry cases of “air- </p><p>tights.” Mr. Scattergood looked much the </p><p>worse for wear. He had changed his </p><p>clothes, but the appearance of his face and </p><p>the cramped manner in which he moved </p><p>his arms and legs would have led any one </p><p>without knowledge of the facts into the </p><p>belief that a mule, or other equally muscular </p><p>animal, had assaulted Mr. Scattergood with </p><p>intent to kill. </p><p> Henderson bought tobacco and was</p><p>waited upon by the clerk. Henderson </p><p>went away in search of the marshal. That </p><p>gentleman was found in his office. He too </p><p>had changed his clothes. He too had </p><p>certainly been engaged in desperate con- </p><p>flict. To manifest the slightest curiosity </p><p>concerning the troubles of other men is</p><p>tabu in cowland circles. Henderson gazed </p><p>without interest upon the marshal’s beaten </p><p>countenance. </p><p>“Mornin’, Marshal,” was Henderson’s </p><p>greeting, uttered in a harsh, hoarse tone. </p><p>“Wanna sell some cows—three-year olds?” </p><p>“Sell ’em if I get my price,” the marshal </p><p>grunted sourly. </p><p> “Maybe now we can get together on the</p><p>price—if she ain’t too steep.” </p><p> “How many djuh want?”</p><p> “Depends on the price. Listen here,</p><p>I ain’t even got time to ride out to yore </p><p>ranch an’ inspect any cattle. You’ll have </p><p>to drive—in here, an’ the judge’ll look ’em </p><p>over for me. He knows cows an’ he’s a </p><p>friend o’ mine. Le’s go down to his place </p><p>an’ fix it up.” </p><p>High Pockets </p><p>47 </p><p> The marshal nodded, stood up stiffly</p><p>and tenderly, and stiffly and tenderly </p><p>buckled on his six-shooter. The gun had </p><p>seen service, but the holster and the car- </p><p>tridge-belt were brand new. </p><p> When the two came in sight of Judge</p><p>Allison’s house the jurist was sitting on the </p><p>front porch. A weighty calf-bound volume </p><p>lay open across the judicial knees. He gave </p><p>them an abstracted “Good morning” as </p><p>they drew near and went on with his </p><p>reading. </p><p> “About the cattle deal yo’re gonna help</p><p>me with, Judge,” said Henderson, not for- </p><p>getting to speak hoarsely and harshly. </p><p>“Can we use yore dinin’-room till we get the </p><p>price settled?” </p><p> “By all means, Bill. Make yourselves</p><p>at home.” The judge wondered where </p><p>Henderson had picked up that sudden cold. </p><p> “We might want yuh to help us out later,</p><p>Judge—if yo’re ’round.” </p><p> “I’ll be in my office when you want me.</p><p>I’ve three hours’ work ahead on a most </p><p>interesting case, so take your time.” </p><p> The judge ushered them into the dining-</p><p>room, and crossed the hall to his office and </p><p>closed the door. Henderson closed the </p><p>dining-room door. In through the open </p><p>side-windows, from the direction of the </p><p>corral, floated the trilling lilt of Black Sam’s </p><p>whistle making melody of “Beulah Land.” </p><p>There was no danger of that which Hen- </p><p>derson intended saying to the marshal being </p><p>overheard. </p><p> The marshal let himself carefully down</p><p>upon a chair. Henderson took a key from </p><p>his pocket. The marshal glanced at the </p><p>key, then rapidly and unbelievingly winked </p><p>his one available eye. For Henderson’s </p><p>other hand held a gun, and the round </p><p>muzzle of the gun gaped across the table </p><p>at the marshal’s chest. </p><p> “Put yore hands on the table, Marshal,”</p><p>Henderson requested in his natural tone of </p><p>voice. </p><p> The marshal slowly spread his hands flat</p><p>on the table. He licked his tongue catwise </p><p>over his dry and puffy Ups. </p><p>“By Gawd!” he whispered. “By Gawd!” </p><p>“Yo’re rememberin’ the lonesome road- </p><p>agent, huh?” Henderson queried cheerfully. </p><p> The marshal’s face was expressionless.</p><p>Henderson, without losing for an instant </p><p>the magic of the drop, backed to the side- </p><p>board, slid the hand holding the key behind </p><p>him and opened the sideboard door. He </p><p>crouched, searched within a moment, and </p><p>straightened. In his hand he held a heavy </p><p>blanket bundle. </p><p> He laid the bundle on the table. The</p><p>ironmongery within chinked suggestively. </p><p> “Yore guns an’ the runnin’-iron are in</p><p>here,” Henderson said softly. “Yore star’s </p><p>in my pocket.” </p><p> The marshal remained dumb.</p><p> “Yore rifles—yores an Lafe’s—are cached</p><p>some’ers near the Blythe ranch,” went on </p><p>Henderson. “I dunno as I wanna buy no </p><p>cows—now. But I guess maybe you do.” </p><p>“Whadda you mean?” grated the mar- </p><p>shal. </p><p> “I mean yo’re gonna have a chance—</p><p>a chance no rustler ever got before. But </p><p>I’m figuring yo’re worth more alive than </p><p>yuh would be lynched. I gotcha fannin’ </p><p>yore ears on a pin, Marshal. Here’s all </p><p>the evidence, except the rifles, an’ I seen </p><p>what I seen, an’ I guess a jury’d believe </p><p>it—knowin’ me.” </p><p> “I thought yore face was familiar!” came</p><p>the husky whisper. “Yo’re Bill-” </p><p> “Nemmine about no names,” Henderson</p><p>interrupted swiftly. “Yuh know me now, </p><p>an’ so you be happy. Yuh’ve learned </p><p>somethin’, an’ here’s the rest o’ the lesson. </p><p>When a certain lady tried to sell her cattle </p><p>here yuh didn’t wanna buy, an’ yuh stopped </p><p>Lafe Scattergood from buyin’. Yore blister </p><p>of a mind had a better idea. When this </p><p>lady needed protection from Sam Bellows </p><p>yuh didn’t have no help handy. Like the </p><p>sneakin’ hound yuh are yuh let Sam hell</p><p>’round all he liked. I tell yuh plain, </p><p>Marshal, if I wasn’t thinkin’ o’ the interests </p><p>of the lady, I’d wring yore-neck. </p><p> “What yo’re gonna do, you an’ Lafe</p><p>Scattergood, is buy her cows, her hosses an’ </p><p>her ranch. The ranch ain’t been proved </p><p>up on, so I’ll ask the lady to sign a quit- </p><p>claim along with the bill o’ sale. Also, </p><p>feller, if Miss Blythe changes her mind an’ </p><p>wants the ranch back you’ll let her have </p><p>it, you an’ Lafe will, without makin’ no </p><p>yowl about it. But I’m bettin’ she won’t </p><p>want it back, ’cept maybe the iixin’s inside. </p><p>You’ll take good care o’ them fixin’s till </p><p>she sends for ’em. I’m forgettin’ to say </p><p>that when yuh do these li’l things my </p><p>mouth is shut. Nobody’ll know what </p><p>happened yest’day at the Lazy T ’cept me </p><p>an’ you an’ Lafe. You can go on bein’ </p><p>marshal, an’ Lafe can go on keepin’ store. </p><p>“But you an’ him gotta travel a heap </p><p>48 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>straight. That’s part o’ the proposition, </p><p>too. If you go makin’ bad medicine, </p><p>you fellers, the deal’s off. Yore good eye </p><p>is brightenin’ up. Yo’re thinkin’ o’ some- </p><p>thin’, huh? Yo’re thinkin’ maybe if' I’m </p><p>rubbed out yuh’d be safe. Yeah, is that </p><p>it?' Well, I’ll just snub up that notion </p><p>sudden an’ short. I’ve wrote out everythin’ </p><p>that happened yest’day an’ made two </p><p>copies. Them two copies will be planted </p><p>in two national banks where I know the </p><p>cashiers, an’ this bundle an’ yore star goes </p><p>with one of ’em. The original will go </p><p>some’ers else. All three will carry in- </p><p>structions on their envelopes sayin’ how </p><p>they’re to be opened an’ read if I’m wiped </p><p>out, and destroyed unread only in case I die </p><p>of old age or a real shore-’nough sickness. </p><p>See? The longer I live unshot the longer </p><p>you’ll be happy.” </p><p> “S’pose—s’pose yo’re killed an’ we don’t</p><p>have nothin’ to do with it?” </p><p> “Then you an’ Lafe better straddle yore</p><p>fastest cayuses an’ punch the breeze.” </p><p>“But-” </p><p> “They ain’t no ‘buts,’ not one li’l, li’l</p><p>‘but.’ Yo’re out on a limb, Marshal. Yuh </p><p>gotta drop.” </p><p> “Yo’re blackmailin’, by Gawd!”</p><p> The marshal’s guttural snarl was as</p><p>defiant as the man could make it, but a </p><p>clammy sweat was on his forehead, and the </p><p>chilly talons of a sickening fear clutched at </p><p>his evil soul. He had money, had the </p><p>marshal. He had a standing. He had </p><p>been caught. Shame new-born pounced </p><p>down and made holiday with Fear. In the </p><p>conception of which shame conscience had </p><p>no part. It was shame at being found out, </p><p>at being helpless before a better man—the </p><p>bitter shame the sinful know when Nemesis </p><p>lays them by the heels. </p><p> The marshal’s lips writhed apart. He</p><p>showed his teeth. He panted at the calm </p><p>citizen behind the gun. </p><p> “Yo’re blackmailin’,” he repeated.</p><p>“Yo’re blackmailin’.” </p><p> “Aw right,” said Henderson. “I’ll just</p><p>call in Judge Allison, tell him what I know, </p><p>an’ show him what’s in the blanket, like- </p><p>wise yore star. Then a posse will ride over </p><p>to the Blythe ranch an’ search out them </p><p>two Winchesters. Between them rifles an’ </p><p>the brand-blotched cattle I throwed out </p><p>on the range, an’ all the rest of it, you an’ </p><p>Lafe had oughta get ten years apiece—if </p><p>yuh ain’t lynched first.” </p><p> “Maybe Lafe won’t agree,” the marshal</p><p>suggested faintly. </p><p> “You got fifteen minutes to persuade</p><p>him,” said Henderson briskly. “If you’n </p><p>him ain’t here inside one li’l quarter-hour </p><p>I’m gonna blat.” </p><p> “How’d I know you’ll keep yore word?”</p><p>chattered the marshal. </p><p> “I’m hard o’ hearin’ today. But I</p><p>thought you said, ‘How’d I know you’ll </p><p>keep yore word?’ Didja?” </p><p> “I did not. I’m—I’m goin’ now.”</p><p> “Wait a shake. I wanna show you</p><p>somethin’ first. Le’s go in the judge’s </p><p>office, you an’ me.” </p><p> Henderson hooked an affectionate arm</p><p>in the crook of the marshal’s elbow. But </p><p>the officer was not deceived. He could feel </p><p>the hard muzzle of the six-shooter nudging </p><p>his ribs. Arm in arm the two entered the </p><p>judge’s office. Judge Allison, overflowing </p><p>a tip-tilted chair, his feet on the window- </p><p>sill, was enjoying a cigar and reading the </p><p>calf-bound volume. </p><p> “Can I use yore desk a minute, Judge?”</p><p>said Henderson, skilfully concealing the six- </p><p>shooter under the flap of his vest. </p><p> “Certainly,” replied Judge Allison, with-</p><p>out turning his head. </p><p>HENDERSON seated the marshal </p><p>before the desk. From a pigeon- </p><p>hole he took the three envelopes, </p><p>opened them, and flattened the contents </p><p>on the desk beneath the marshal’s eyes. </p><p> “Read and sign,” Henderson whispered</p><p>tactfully in the marshal’s ear. “They’s the </p><p>pen yonder.”</p><p> The marshal read with emotion—emotion</p><p>that was nauseating. His body shook a </p><p>little. The six-shooter tentatively poked </p><p>him in the ribs. </p><p> “They’s the pen,” reminded Henderson.</p><p>At that moment, in the marshal’s opin- </p><p>ion, Henderson was the very devil indeed. </p><p>And Judge Allison within ten feet! The </p><p>trap had been fairly sprung. The marshal </p><p>coughed to conceal a groan and stretched </p><p>forth a hand to grasp the pen. </p><p> When the three papers had each been</p><p>signed Henderson replaced them in their </p><p>envelopes, returned the envelopes to the </p><p>pigeon-hole, and took the marshal back </p><p>into the dining-room and closed the </p><p>door. </p><p> “I thought maybe yuh’d feel more like</p><p>persuadin’ Lafe if you signed first,” </p><p> 18</p><p>High Pockets </p><p>49 </p><p>Henderson explained brightly, grinning at </p><p>the marshal. </p><p> Words failed the marshal. His knees felt</p><p>strangely weak. Nevertheless he managed </p><p>to effect a conventional, if somewhat </p><p>hurried, withdrawal. </p><p> The judge stared wonderingly out of the</p><p>window. He thought of the marshal’s </p><p>bruised face, the scratching of a hurrying </p><p>pen and the speedy fashion of the man’s </p><p>packing off. </p><p> “This is interesting,” mused Judge Alli-</p><p>son. “Very interesting. I wonder what </p><p>it’s all about.” </p><p> Within twelve minutes from the time of</p><p>his exit the marshal returned. With him </p><p>came Mr. Scattergood. There was fear </p><p>in the expression of Mr. Scattergood. Hen- </p><p>derson, in the dining-room, perceived that </p><p>fear. The judge, looking through his win- </p><p>dow, saw eye to eye with Henderson. </p><p> “Damnation,” murmured the judge, who</p><p>was but human. “Bill’s using me for his </p><p>own fell purposes and won’t tell me a word. </p><p>Damnation.” </p><p> “C’mon in,” invited Henderson, as the</p><p>marshal and Mr. Scattergood hesitated on </p><p>the porch. </p><p> They entered, Mr. Scattergood with</p><p>diffidence, and the marshal kicked the door </p><p>shut with a bang. Mr. Scattergood started </p><p>nervously. Henderson smiled. He had </p><p>not drawn his gun, but his washed-out gray </p><p>eyes were alert as a hungry tiger’s. </p><p> “Might as well sit down,” he suggested</p><p>civilly. </p><p> They sat with much scraping of chair</p><p>legs. The marshal gazed sulkily at Hen- </p><p>derson. Mr. Scattergood stared in sullen </p><p>fascination at the blanket bundle on the </p><p>table. Henderson leaned back agaiUst the </p><p>sideboard. One thumb was caught in his </p><p>belt. The other, the left, was thrust into </p><p>the waistband of his trousers. </p><p> “About them cattle,” he began bruskly,</p><p>“the price o’ them cows’ll be five thousand </p><p>dollars.” </p><p> “Five thousand dollars for forty cows!”</p><p>exclaimed the marshal, gaping in amaze. </p><p> Mr. Scattergood rubbed a worried hand</p><p>across his gulping throat. </p><p> “Forty-two cows,” corrected Henderson.</p><p>“All good an’ fat, Lazy T an’ Barred Box </p><p>brands.” </p><p> “I ain’t got that much money,” denied</p><p>Mr. Scattergood. </p><p> “Only twenty-five hundred from you,”</p><p> explained Henderson. “The marshal takes</p><p>the other half.” </p><p> “I ain’t got no twenty-five hundred,”</p><p>lamented the marshal. </p><p> “Me neither,” chimed in Mr. Scatter-</p><p>good. </p><p> “That is tough,” commiserated Hen-</p><p>derson. “I suppose I’ll have to tell the </p><p>judge after all.” </p><p> “Maybe—maybe I can borrow it,” sur-</p><p>rendered the marshal. </p><p> “I dunno where I can get it,” Mr. Scatter-</p><p>good affirmed faintly. </p><p> “I’d scratch my head an’ think,” advised</p><p>Henderson. “You two chunkers make me </p><p>sick! Yuh got money, both of you! </p><p>Don’t try to tell me different! Marshal, </p><p>with yore ranch an’ all yo’re worth twenty </p><p>thousand easy. An’ Lafe, if you can’t dig </p><p>up thirty thousand I’ll eat my hoss. I want </p><p>a thousand apiece in cash, an’ I’ll take yore </p><p>checks on the First National in Piegan City, </p><p>where I know yuh got accounts, for the </p><p>rest.” </p><p> “Yuh ain’t got no power of attorney,”</p><p>protested Mr. Scattergood. </p><p> “Yo’re a helluva gent to yap about power</p><p>of attorney! I didn’t notice no power of </p><p>attorney when you an’ yore friend was </p><p>blottin’ them cows. Not only will yuh </p><p>gimme that two thousand an’ write them </p><p>checks, makin’ ’em payable to Miss Joy</p><p>Blythe, but yo’re gonna write a letter, each </p><p>o’ yuh, to the First National’s cashier </p><p>tellin’ him to place the three thousand to </p><p>Miss Blythe’s account an’ write her a regis- </p><p>tered letter at Farewell sayin’ it’s been </p><p>done. Allowin’ for delays, if the lady </p><p>don’t hear from the First National inside </p><p>o’ seven days 111 take it yo’re not keepin’ </p><p>yore side o’ the bargain an’ act accordin’. </p><p>See how easy I’ve fixed it for yuh. All </p><p>yuh gotta do is take yore pen in hand.” </p><p> He looked expectantly at the two</p><p>rogues. </p><p> The two rogues looked each upon the</p><p>other, and there was no affection in their </p><p>eyes. They turned their faces toward </p><p>Henderson and slowly nodded their </p><p>wretched heads. </p><p> “That’s the ticket,” Henderson said</p><p>warmly. “The judge has a First National </p><p>check-book. We’ll go right in his office </p><p>where they’s plenty to write with. An’ </p><p>while we’re in there Lafe will spread his </p><p>name on them three li’l reports o’ mine.” </p><p> And Lafe did.</p><p>50 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>CHAPTER XV </p><p>HOT IRON </p><p>FROM Marysville Henderson, two thou- </p><p>sand dollars in gold tied up in the </p><p>slicker behind his cantle, rode north. He </p><p>did not push his horse, and he traveled by </p><p>way of the Bar S line camp on Packsaddle </p><p>Creek and the 88 ranch-house. </p><p> He remained a day and a night at the</p><p>latter place, and spent a great deal of time </p><p>in conversation with his friend Tom </p><p>Dowling and Lanpher, the grumpy man- </p><p>ager. </p><p> He learned, among other bits of more</p><p>important information, that Mr. Simms </p><p>was resting easily in the manager’s own </p><p>bed and bade fair to make a good recovery. </p><p>He did not visit Mr. Simms. He felt that, </p><p>under the circumstances, such procedure </p><p>would be indelicate. </p><p> The miles between the 88 and Farewell</p><p>were covered without incident. The hotel </p><p>guests were at dinner when Henderson </p><p>dismounted at the corral. He could hear </p><p>the clinking of knives and forks and scraps </p><p>of conversation. He heard Chuck’s voice </p><p>and Miss Blythe’s low laugh, and he smiled. </p><p> “Guess Sam’s been a good boy,” was his</p><p>thought as he went to the kitchen door </p><p>after stripping off saddle and bridle and </p><p>turning his horse into the corral. </p><p> “Howdy, Mis’ Lainey,” he said taking</p><p>off his hat to the angular woman busy at </p><p>the range. “Guess I’ll eat out here if </p><p>yuh’ll sling some beans an’ beef on a plate </p><p>an’ gimme a cup o’ coffee.” </p><p> “Why, shore,” smiled Mrs. Lainey, ever</p><p>appreciative of courtesy she received but </p><p>seldom. “I was wonderin’ when you’d </p><p>be back. They’s the basin an’ soap on </p><p>the bench. Water’s in the pail under- </p><p>neath. I’ll get you a clean towel.” </p><p> “After supper,” he said, when she handed</p><p>him the food, “I wish yuh’d ask Miss </p><p>Blythe to come out here to the corral.” </p><p> He sat down facing his saddle on the log</p><p>near the corral gate and ate his supper. </p><p>The meal finished and cup and dish re- </p><p>turned to Mrs. Lainey, he returned to the </p><p>log and rolled a satisfied cigaret. His eyes </p><p>strayed to the bulgy slicker on the saddle. </p><p> “That ought to help a li’l bit,” he told</p><p>himself. “With that an’ the money in the </p><p>Piegan City bank she can go ’way an’ do </p><p>what she wants.” </p><p>The half-smile faded. The stubby mus- </p><p>tache straightened. His face became </p><p>serious. He rested his elbows on his </p><p>knees and surveyed the smoke spiral ing </p><p>upward from the glowing tip of his cigaret. </p><p>He knew that he did not wish Miss Blythe </p><p>to go away. And by his own carefully- </p><p>planned actions he had made it possible </p><p>for her to do that very thing. He had </p><p>not previously considered the matter in </p><p>this light. </p><p> She would certainly go away—Denver,</p><p>Chicago, or some other equally impossible </p><p>place. That every week she remained in </p><p>Farewell was costing him an amount pro- </p><p>portionate to half the monthly wages of </p><p>a good puncher troubled him not at all. </p><p>He would cheerfully have gone on paying </p><p>down till the end of time. </p><p> He dropped the cigaret and ground it</p><p>into the earth with the sole of his boot </p><p>and swore gently. Then he sprang up </p><p>and removed his hat, for Miss Blythe was </p><p>coming out of the kitchen door. </p><p> “Yo’re lookin’ better,” he informed her,</p><p>when he had shaken hands and was sitting </p><p>beside her on the log. </p><p> “Am I?”</p><p> She lifted grave, dark eyes in a swift</p><p>glance and dropped them again. </p><p> “Shore. Yuh—yuh don’t look scared o’</p><p>nothin’ now.” </p><p> “Perhaps I’m not any more,” she said in</p><p>a low voice. </p><p> “Bellows still here?”</p><p> “Yes,” she nodded.</p><p> “Has he done what I told him?”</p><p> “He surely has. I don’t think he’ll ever</p><p>bother me again.” . </p><p> “We’ll hope so—on his account. I</p><p>stopped at yore ranch, ma’am, while I was </p><p>away,- an’ I sold yore cattle.” </p><p> “You sold my cattle!” she repeated, eyes</p><p>wide with amazement. </p><p> “I know it was kind o’ nervy, but I seen</p><p>a good chance, so I done it. I sold the </p><p>ranch too.” </p><p> Miss Blythe gasped.</p><p> “Would you mind repeating that?” she</p><p>asked when she could speak. </p><p> “I sold yore ranch an’ yore cattle, ma’am.</p><p>I know it was nervy like I say, but yuh </p><p>told me you wanted to sell ’em, so I done it. </p><p>I’m sorry if yo’re mad. But I can fix it up </p><p>so’s yuh can have everythin’ back, an-” </p><p> “I’m not mad. I’m glad—glad. But</p><p>how did you manage it, when the claim </p><p>hasn’t been proved up?” </p><p>High Pockets </p><p>51 </p><p> “Oh, the fellers are gonna put a jigger</p><p>on it to hold her down an’ prove up for ’em, </p><p>I guess. But that don’t matter. Inside </p><p>the slicker on my saddle is two thousand </p><p>dollars an’ a bill o’ sale an’ a quit-claim </p><p>deed for you to sign.” </p><p> “Two thousand dollars!”</p><p> “Two thousand in the slicker, an’ three</p><p>thousand more to yore account in the First </p><p>National Bank at Piegan City. Yuh’ll be </p><p>notified in two — three days now. If yuh </p><p>ain’t, lemme know.” </p><p> “But—but—why, that’s five thousand</p><p>dollars!” </p><p> “Yore ’rithmetic’s fine, ma’am.”</p><p> “The claim and the cows can’t be worth</p><p>all that.” </p><p> “Oh, yes, they are. I dunno but what</p><p>them fellers would ’a’ paid more. They was </p><p>a heap anxious to buy—a heap anxious.” </p><p>“Who are they?” </p><p> “The Marysville marshal an’ Lafe Scat-</p><p>tergood,” he told her. “Yeah, yeah, I </p><p>know,” he added hastily, “they might not </p><p>’a’ wanted to buy one time, but they </p><p>changed their minds when they seen how </p><p>good the claim an’ the cows was. I talked </p><p>it up to ’em best I knowed, an’ they just </p><p>couldn’t help but buy.” </p><p> She looked at him, a slight frown between</p><p>her curving eyebrows. </p><p> “You mean to say those two men paid</p><p>five thousand dollars for forty-two cows </p><p>and a quarter-section.” </p><p> She crossed her knees, clasped her hands in</p><p>her lap, and cocked a skeptical head at him. </p><p> “They was two hosses—three hosses—</p><p>besides. The one you rode will likely drift </p><p>back some time.” </p><p> “Oh, nonsense, Mister Henderson. Do</p><p>be serious.” </p><p> “I am. Don’tcha go frettin’ over this</p><p>deal, ma’am. The marshal an’ Lafe figured </p><p>they was gettin’ it cheap. I dunno but what </p><p>they thought they was gold in them hills.” </p><p>“No one’s ever found any west of the </p><p>Dry Mountains. My brother told me.” </p><p>“You never can tell, not in this country. </p><p>So if yo’re satisfied with what I done I’ll </p><p>give you the money in the slicker an’ get it </p><p>off my hands.” </p><p>l _ J HE LEANED sidewise and began </p><p>to unfasten the knots in the saddle- </p><p>strings. She promptly seized his </p><p>elbow with both hands and pulled him up- </p><p>right. </p><p> “You take care of it,” she implored. “I</p><p>wouldn’t know what to do with it.” </p><p> “Yuh could go ’way like yuh told me yuh</p><p>wanted.” </p><p> He stared down at her anxiously.</p><p> “I guess I don’t want to go away as much</p><p>as I did. I’m getting to know people here, </p><p>and—and everybody’s so friendly and nice </p><p>to me. I like keeping store. Maybe </p><p>Mister Flynn would let me buy a half- </p><p>interest. Do you think he would?” </p><p> “I guess maybe. But I can’t keep this</p><p>money. She’d ought to be in a bank </p><p>some’ers. Tell. yuh what. I’ll give her </p><p>to ‘Buck’ Saylor to put in the Wells Fargo </p><p>safe. Buck he sleeps right in the office </p><p>with two dogs. They ain’t nobody gonna </p><p>get gay with the express company’s money </p><p>while Buck’s in there.” </p><p> “Yes, do that. That’ll be fine. But—</p><p>but must you do it right away? You’re </p><p>awfully provoking, Mister Henderson. You </p><p>keep doing the most wonderful things for </p><p>me and then you rush off without saying </p><p>two words to me. Can’t you stay and talk </p><p>to me a little while? I’m lonely.” </p><p> She looked at him wistfully.</p><p> When a pretty girl looks at you wistfully</p><p>and tells you she’s lonely there is but one </p><p>thing to do. Quite so. </p><p> At nine o’clock Mr. Lainey wandered</p><p>out into the dark kitchen and bumped into </p><p>his wife who was sitting on a chair gazing </p><p>fixedly out of the window.</p><p> “Look where yo’re goin’, yuh overgrown</p><p>punkin!” she ordered him fiercely. “Keep </p><p>quiet!” </p><p> “Whatsa matter?” he asked bewilderedly.</p><p>“Bill Henderson an’ Joy Blythe are </p><p>a-settin’ out on that log by the corral gate. </p><p>They been settin’ there since after supper, </p><p>an’ he ain’t kissed her yet. I’m waitin’ </p><p>till he does.” </p><p> “Maybe he don’t wanna kiss her,”</p><p>suggested Mrs. Lainey’s husband. </p><p> “Yo’re a fool, Bill Lainey. Who wouldn’t</p><p>wanna kiss her sweet face?” </p><p> “I don’t.”</p><p> “Lemme catch yuh. Just lemme once.</p><p>I wish they wasn’t so far off. I’d like to </p><p>hear what they’re sayin’.” </p><p> “Well, they are, an’ yuh can’t, an’ I</p><p>wanna cup o’ coffee. Where’s the lamp?” </p><p>The romance-hungry Mrs. Lainey arose </p><p>arid felt in the corner for the broom. But </p><p>her husband fled before she found it. She </p><p>returned to her observation post in time </p><p>52 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>to see Henderson and Miss Blythe walking </p><p>streetward. </p><p> Ten minutes later Henderson left Miss</p><p>Blythe at the door of the hotel. Miss </p><p>Blythe, Buck Saylor’s, receipt snug and </p><p>warm in the bosom of iher gown, went to </p><p>her room. Henderson started system- </p><p>atically to find Chuck Morgan. </p><p> He found him, after a search of half an</p><p>hour, sitting on the counter of the Blue </p><p>Pigeon listening raptly while Mike Flynn </p><p>held forth on life as it is lived by the natives </p><p>of the South Sea Islands. </p><p> “Is that all they wear?” Chuck was</p><p>asking at the moment of Henderson’s </p><p>entrance. </p><p> “Shore, not another stitch,” Mike re-</p><p>plied. “Add a war-club for the min, or </p><p>maybe a trade-knife, an’ yuh have their </p><p>complate costume. There ain’t—here’s </p><p>Bill! H’are yuh, stranger?” </p><p> “Howdy, Mike. Howdy, Chuck. How</p><p>long yuh been broke, Chuck?” </p><p> He sat down beside the puncher and,</p><p>under cover of Chuck’s wing chaps, heavily </p><p>rammed his friend with a strong and </p><p>stiffened thumb. </p><p> “Broke!” repeated Chuck. “Meanin*</p><p>how?” </p><p> “Well, I looked in all the saloons for yuh,</p><p>an’ nobody’d seen yuh since noon, so, </p><p>knowin’ you, I knowed yuh must be broke!” </p><p>“Is that so? Is that so? I ain’t sayin’ </p><p>a word about present company, but when </p><p>the barkeep sees me cornin’ he don’t trot </p><p>out no pail. Nawsir, I ain’t no human </p><p>sponge. I’m a moral man, I am, but if </p><p>yo’re gonna slide an’ go splash I’ll trail </p><p>along an’ pull yuh out.” </p><p> Chuck slid off the counter with a jingling</p><p>thud of spurred heels. </p><p> Once in the street Henderson turned in</p><p>the direction of the Canton. Chuck took </p><p>the outside edge of the sidewalk. </p><p> “Yo’re punchin’ me with yore thumb</p><p>thataway wasn’t no accident,” said Chuck </p><p>in a low voice. “What’s up?” </p><p> “Lots—I hope. Just now I gotta talk</p><p>with Sing Luey. He’s in the Canton alone. </p><p>I seen him when I come by. If he’s still </p><p>alone you’n me’ll go in an’ borrow matches </p><p>so she’ll look natural from the street. I </p><p>gotta talk to Sing Luey private—just </p><p>you’n me. See?” </p><p> The Canton was empty of guests. Sing</p><p>Luey, a lamp on the table at his elbow, sat </p><p>hump-shouldered on a stool and sucked his </p><p>long, silver-mounted pipe. He rose as they </p><p>entered and bowed gravely. </p><p> “Wanna borrow a match, Sing Luey,”</p><p>Henderson announced in a loud tone. </p><p>Then, in a whisper, his lips barely moving, </p><p>he added: “I gotta talk to yuh. Send yore </p><p>cook in here, an’ let us in at the back door.” </p><p>Sing Luey’s inscrutable face did not move </p><p>a muscle. </p><p> “Here are matches,” he said. “For the</p><p>rest, you shall have what you desire in five </p><p>minutes.” </p><p> The two departed. In exactly five</p><p>minutes, no more, no less, Sing Luey opened </p><p>the kitchen door to Henderson and Chuck </p><p>Morgan. </p><p>AN HOUR later the door opened </p><p>and the two white men, stumbling a </p><p>little in the darkness, issued and </p><p>tiptoed their cautious way to the rear of </p><p>Kennedy’s stable. There they sat them </p><p>down and made cigarets. </p><p> “I’m bettin’ it’ll work,” observed Chuck,</p><p>with his thumbnail scratching a match </p><p>alight inside his hat. </p><p> “If it don’t, they’s other ways,” said</p><p>Henderson. “Pinch her out. I’ll light up </p><p>from yore pill.” </p><p> “The Rainbow oughta sift in tomorrow,”</p><p>remarked Chuck, proffering his cigaret. </p><p> “She ought,” Henderson said, leaning</p><p>forward to get a light. “How’s Sam been </p><p>actin’ since I left yuh?” he asked between </p><p>draws.</p><p> “Spendin’ most o’ his time in the dance-</p><p>hall an’ his money in the Happy Heart </p><p>buckin’ Longhorn’s games.” </p><p> “Irrigate much?”</p><p> “Enough to bloat a cow. But it never</p><p>affects him none so’s yuh can notice it.” </p><p> “I wish he would get drunk. He’d pry</p><p>things loose then, an’ a feller’d know what </p><p>to do. But these here quiet devils are </p><p>hellions to put yore finger on.” </p><p> “It’ll come to a show-down some day.”</p><p>“Yo’re whistlin’, but I’ve got business, </p><p>Chuck,” complained the fretful Henderson. </p><p>“I can’t lay ’round here till I grow roots </p><p>like a cottonwood waitin’ for him to make </p><p>his play. An’ I ain’t gonna, y’betcha. </p><p>Le’s go over to the dance-hall. Maybe </p><p>Sam’s there.” </p><p> “Yo’re on the prod tonight.”</p><p> “Never think it,” Henderson denied,</p><p>mindful of his promise to Miss Blythe. </p><p>“I ain’t lookin’ for no fight whatever. It </p><p>High Pockets </p><p>53 </p><p>ain’t exactly out of my way to go over to </p><p>the dance-hall neither. I’m just gonna </p><p>browse ’round an’ be sociable. If Sam is </p><p>huntin’ trouble an’ searches me out I gotta </p><p>defend myself, don’t I? What could be </p><p>fairer than that, huh?” </p><p> Henderson’s manner and tone were so</p><p>earnest that Chuck was mystified. </p><p> “Why, shore, shore,” said he. “Why</p><p>not? Whatcha askin’ me for?” </p><p> Henderson stood up and scratched his</p><p>head. </p><p> “I dunno,” he said truthfully. “C’mon.”</p><p> They entered the Dewdrop and gravi-</p><p>tated to the bar, taking their places at the </p><p>end near the street door as behooved </p><p>gentlemen unpopular with the management. </p><p>The bartender served them in silence. </p><p>Cupping their left hands ’round their </p><p>glasses they slouched sidewise against the </p><p>wood and surveyed the scene of what men </p><p>in their blindness miscall gaiety. </p><p> The Dewdrop was as busy as a church</p><p>fair. The barkeeper was not idle a moment, </p><p>nor were the customers. Two of the latter </p><p>had, early in the evening as it was, gone </p><p>down into the pit whence they had been </p><p>digged, and were sleeping the sleep of the </p><p>drunken on the floor against the wall, where </p><p>they would be reasonably safe from careless </p><p>feet. </p><p> The five women were earning their wages</p><p>quite literally by the sweat of their brows. </p><p>Dancing on a hot night ceases to be a form </p><p>of recreation—if it ever was for them— </p><p>and becomes an exercise. The perspiration </p><p>trickled down their faces and made little </p><p>channels in the powder and the paint. </p><p>But their hard eyes gleamed brightly as </p><p>ever in the lamplight and their carmined </p><p>lips tossed Rabelaisian quips at favored </p><p>friends with unabated vigor. </p><p> Upon a window sill Sam Bellows sat</p><p>alone. Beyond a quick glance of recog- </p><p>nition as Henderson entered he paid the </p><p>latter no attention. There were other men </p><p>leaning against walls and sitting on tip-</p><p>tilted chairs. In places they were shoulder </p><p>to shoulder, but there was a space of several </p><p>feet on Sam Bellows’ either hand. Which </p><p>was natural. Men that hold life lightly </p><p>and take it in the same manner are not </p><p>beings with whom one can feel wholly at </p><p>ease. </p><p> The fiddler on his-table cut short “La</p><p>Paloma” without the customary flourish </p><p>and wiped his dripping chin. </p><p> “Hot, ain’t it?” he said to Kansas Casey,</p><p>who was sitting on the table edge swinging </p><p>his legs. </p><p> “Y’betcha,” replied the deputy.</p><p> The couples crowded to the bar. The</p><p>partner of the red-haired girl had his drink </p><p>and departed. The red-haired girl strolled </p><p>across the room, beseeching all and sundry </p><p>to dance. She was out of luck till she </p><p>passed Sam Bellows who promptly stretched </p><p>out a long arm and seized her by the wrist. </p><p> “Lemme alone!” she squalled, and jerked</p><p>free with a twist and a wrench. </p><p> Bellows, smiling wickedly, slid from the</p><p>window sill and grabbed her again. She </p><p>clawed at his eyes with her free hand and </p><p>spat like a cat. </p><p> “Lemme alone, - yore soul!” she</p><p>yelled. </p><p> Bellows, still smiling, threw up his right</p><p>hand to guard his eyes. With an in- </p><p>credibly swift movement the girl’s head </p><p>shot forward and her white teeth closed </p><p>on his fingers. She began to chew </p><p>savagely. </p><p> Bellows instantly released her arm and</p><p>ground his hard knuckles into her cheek. </p><p> “Leggo!” he panted. “Leggo!”</p><p> Her reply to that was to scratch his face</p><p>from temple to chin. His fingers closed </p><p>on her throat. He had ceased to smile. </p><p>His teeth were bare to the gum. His </p><p>expression was murderous. </p><p> Then, Kansas Casey in the lead, seven</p><p>men flung themselves upon Bellows, and</p><p>two others grappled with the woman. </p><p> “Stop it!” bawled Windy Taylor, as with</p><p>thumb and second finger he strove to force </p><p>apart her jaws after the fashion of one </p><p>persuading a stubborn horse to take the bit. </p><p> The lady clung to Bellows and closed</p><p>down like a bulldog. A trickle of blood </p><p>dribbled from the corners of her mouth. </p><p>She was not pretty to look upon. </p><p> The little group of struggling people</p><p>swayed and stamped and reeled to and fro </p><p>and banged against the wall. Windy did </p><p>not cease to pry and beseech the lady to </p><p>“Leggo!” But he could not break her grip. </p><p>Bellows, with various men attached to his </p><p>arms and legs, was helpless. But he could </p><p>curse. And he did—horribly. </p><p> The fiddler, who had disappeared, now</p><p>returned bearing a pepper-pot. This article </p><p>of kitchen-ware he upended and violently </p><p>shook in front of the red-haired girl’s nose. </p><p>She sneezed. Her jaws opened, and the </p><p>54 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>men holding her bore her backward with a </p><p>rush. The men fastened upon Bellows </p><p>bore him as rapidly in the other direction. </p><p> “Pepper always fixes ’em,” observed the</p><p>fiddler, and returned to his table and </p><p>climbed upon it to his chair. </p><p> The red-haired girl, reaction setting in,</p><p>sat down on the floor and sobbed stormily. </p><p>She also sneezed at not infrequent intervals, </p><p>for the fiddler’s pepper had been finely </p><p>ground. </p><p> Sam Bellows, released somewhat hastily</p><p>by Casey’s assistants, stood in the doorway. </p><p>Blood oozed sluggishly down his well- </p><p>scratched face and dripped from his torn </p><p>fingers. He had regained control of him- </p><p>self, but his light eyes, the pupils narrowed </p><p>to pin-points, were deadly. Kansas Casey </p><p>faced him hardily. The deputy had not </p><p>drawn his gun, but his right hand swung </p><p>close to the butt. He placed no trust in </p><p>Sam Bellows, despite the latter’s partial </p><p>disablement. </p><p> “This will be about all,” said Kansas</p><p>Casey quietly. “Drag it out o’ here.” </p><p>“S’pose I don’t feel like goin’,” Bellows </p><p>suggested with icy cahn. </p><p> “I ain’t makin’ no threats—but you’ll go</p><p>just the same.” </p><p> “You’ve got the call,” Bellows said with</p><p>a feline grin. “I’ll go—now. But I’ll be </p><p>back. I seem to have made a lot o’ friends </p><p>here tonight.” </p><p> His light eyes picked out the faces of the</p><p>men who had been holding him. </p><p> “The bridle’s off to you tomorrow, but</p><p>you won’t come in here again tonight,” </p><p>declared the deputy. “An’ I’d go a li’l slow, </p><p>if I was you—later.” </p><p> “You ain’t me,” said Bellows shortly, and</p><p>he wheeled and walked out into the night. </p><p>CHAPTER XVI </p><p>THE BRANDING </p><p>NEXT day’s stage brought a letter for </p><p>Miss Blythe. She showed it happily </p><p>to Henderson in front of the Blue Pigeon. </p><p>It was from the cashier of the First National </p><p>in Piegan City, and duly set forth that </p><p>three thousand dollars had been deposited </p><p>to Miss Blythe’s account. </p><p> “That’s fine,” said Henderson. “It come</p><p>sooner’n I expected. Didja ask Mike about </p><p>goin’ partners?” </p><p> “I did. He said, 'Shore.’ We’re going</p><p>to get a whole lot of new stock and make </p><p>the store bigger.” </p><p> “That’s the stuff. Put a crimp in Dolan</p><p>an’ Calloway.” </p><p> On the instant the girl’s expression</p><p>altered subtly. A shiver of repugnance </p><p>made her eyelids flicker. But it was not </p><p>Henderson’s words that affected her. Sam </p><p>Bellows was coming down the street. Hen- </p><p>derson saw him, too, and began to speak of </p><p>a certain gray pony that he was positive </p><p>Miss Blythe would enjoy riding. Out of </p><p>his eye-corners he continued to watch </p><p>Bellows. He noted that the puncher’s </p><p>right hand was bandaged and that he wore </p><p>his six-shooter in a new left-handed holster </p><p>tied down on his left leg. </p><p> Bellows smiled openly at Miss Blythe</p><p>as he passed. Because the scratches on </p><p>his face were deep and long it was an oddly </p><p>crooked smile. Over his shoulder he gave </p><p>Henderson the feline grin he had bestowed </p><p>on Kansas Casey the evening before. </p><p>Miss Blythe shivered again. </p><p> “I—I guess I’ll go in,” she said a trifle</p><p>wanly. </p><p> Henderson followed her into the Blue</p><p>Pigeon. </p><p> “Look here,” he ground out roughly.</p><p>“He’s searin’ you again. You just lemme </p><p>off that promise, will yuh?” </p><p> She shook her head.</p><p> “No, I won’t. He just makes me feel</p><p>shaky when he looks at me that way. I’m </p><p>not scared, truly I’m not—when you’re </p><p>around.”</p><p> She looked up at him with her great dark</p><p>eyes—eyes that were deep pools of mystery. </p><p>Her lips were parted ever so little. Hen- </p><p>derson caught his breath. He had never </p><p>seen her look like this. Nor had he ever </p><p>felt like this. At other times, when in her </p><p>company, he had experienced a certain </p><p>pleasant mental agitation. But that sen- </p><p>sation was but a ripple to the wave of feeling </p><p>that engulfed him now. He stared. Her </p><p>eyes held his unwaveringly. He trembled </p><p>like an over-ridden horse. There was in </p><p>his ears a buzzing astif countless bees. He </p><p>tried to speak and couldn’t. He gulped </p><p>like a schoolboy and passed a shaking hand </p><p>across his forehead. </p><p> “Tha-tha’s fine,” he finally managed to</p><p>stammer out, and incontinently lied to his </p><p>haven of refuge, the log at the hotel corral. </p><p> “Whatsa matter with me?” he asked him-</p><p>self furiously. “I got lots o’ things to say </p><p>High Pockets </p><p>55 </p><p>to her, an’ I can’t say ’em. Last night I </p><p>could talk to her like a house afire. This is </p><p>a helluva note!” </p><p> Mrs. Lainey, busy in the hotel kitchen,</p><p>wondered why he was making cigarets and </p><p>throwing them away unsmoked. She de- </p><p>cided, wise woman though she was, that </p><p>Henderson was drunk. </p><p> In the afternoon came the Rainbow on</p><p>Windigo and said that all things were ready. </p><p>Henderson listened to her words and smiled. </p><p>The smile was not mirthful. It was sar- </p><p>donic. The Rainbow narrowed her black </p><p>eyes and smiled back. Nor was her smile </p><p>pleasant. One perceived the lurking </p><p>Indian. </p><p> “Everythin’s fixed this end,” observed</p><p>Henderson. “Sing Luey’s kitchen door </p><p>at nine o’clock will be about right.” </p><p> “It should,” said the Rainbow.</p><p> “Instead of a glass, I guess we’ll make it</p><p>a bottle.” </p><p> “That will be better. So long, old-timer,</p><p>see you later.” </p><p> The Rainbow whirled Windigo and was</p><p>gone. </p><p>AT HALF-PAST nine o’clock in </p><p>the evening Henderson and Chuck </p><p>Morgan walked into the dance-hall. </p><p>Chuck Morgan took position at the bar </p><p>near the door. But Henderson did not. </p><p>He sat down across the room on a chair </p><p>facing the bar. Henderson had a bottle </p><p>with him. At times he appeared to take </p><p>long and healthy pulls at that bottle. It </p><p>was not manifest to the naked eye that </p><p>Henderson’s tongue corked the bottle every </p><p>time he tilted it. </p><p> The crowd in the Dewdrop was not so</p><p>large as on the previous evening. Kansas </p><p>Casey and a fair sprinkling of prominent </p><p>citizens were present together with several </p><p>riotous Bar S punchers engaged in the </p><p>pleasing business of spending two months’ </p><p>pay. But of those six gentlemen that had </p><p>assisted Casey in the. subduing of Sam</p><p>Bellows only one, a quiet-eyed person </p><p>named Kane, was in attendance. </p><p> It may have been that the presence of</p><p>Sam Bellows himself had something to do </p><p>with their absence. For Sam was slouching </p><p>on a chair in a far corner. From under- </p><p>neath his shading hat brim he was watching </p><p>the dancers. His attitude and expression </p><p>betokened a lazy tranquility of matter and </p><p>mind. Now and then he smiled slightly, </p><p>crookedly. Certainly one could not divine </p><p>his thoughts. </p><p> A dance ended and the couples paraded to</p><p>the bar. It was the first occasion since the </p><p>arrival of Henderson and Chuck Morgan </p><p>that all five of the dance-hall girls had </p><p>been at the "bar at the same time. Hen- </p><p>derson glanced at Chuck. The latter </p><p>sauntered across the room and leaned </p><p>against the wall near Henderson. </p><p> “Aw-!” exclaimed Henderson drunk-</p><p>enly, and dashed his bottle on the floor. </p><p> At the crash the folk drinking at the bar</p><p>turned their heads. It was consistent then, </p><p>Henderson having seated himself with that </p><p>end in mind, that the doorway should be </p><p>included in the scope of their vision. </p><p> The cork of the shattered bottle had not</p><p>ceased to roll when a man stepped in from </p><p>the outer dark and halted in the doorway. </p><p>To all intents and purposes the man was </p><p>Rufe Thompson in the flesh. From boots </p><p>to hat his clothing was Rufe Thompson’s. </p><p>He stood there, thumbs hooked in his </p><p>belt, silently regarding a stricken room- </p><p>ful. </p><p> The unfortunate Snakebite was the first</p><p>to recover the use of his faculties—recovered </p><p>them only to lose them instantly. After </p><p>uttering a terrifiic squawk of fright he </p><p>foamed at the mouth and fell down in a fit. </p><p>The bartender dived under the bar. The </p><p>fiddler jumped through a window, taking </p><p>with him in his flight the sash thereof. The </p><p>efficient Chuck Morgan hopped through </p><p>another window to head off the fiddler. </p><p> But no one paid any attention to these</p><p>four and their actions. For one of the </p><p>brunettes, her face gray-blue spotted with</p><p>red, was out in the middle of the room </p><p>screaming like a lost soul. </p><p> “Go ’way!” she shrieked at the man in</p><p>the doorway. “Whatcha hauntin’ me for? </p><p>I didn’t know he was gonna kill yuh! I </p><p>swear I didn’t! I didn’t know what was </p><p>gonna happen, or I’d never helped! Gawd! </p><p>Gawd! Don’t look at me that way! I </p><p>can’t stand it! They made me do itl </p><p>They did! They did! Lemme alone! I tell </p><p>yuh I didn’t know Sam Bellows was gonna </p><p>kill yuh!” </p><p> The brunette gasped, choked, then flung</p><p>up her arms and crumpled to the floor in a </p><p>dead faint. Henderson, who had been </p><p>moving unobtrusively in the direction of </p><p>Bellows during the brunette’s outburst, </p><p>went after his gun and leaped forward. </p><p>56 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Sam Bellows likewise leaped—toward the </p><p>nearest window. </p><p> The dance-hall was of course in an</p><p>uproar. The slow-witted folk collided with </p><p>and impeded their quick-thinking brothers. </p><p>Calloway, tripping over a chair, fell against </p><p>Henderson’s gun-hand and knocked the </p><p>upswinging six-shooter to the floor. As </p><p>though this were not enough the blundering </p><p>Calloway, scrambling to regain his balance, </p><p>drove the point of his shoulder into the pit </p><p>of Henderson’s stomach. Which stomach </p><p>was well-muscled, but it gave under the </p><p>blow and the gun in Henderson’s waistband </p><p>promptly slid down inside his trousers and </p><p>jammed its barrel in his boot. </p><p> As yet not a shot had been fired, and Sam</p><p>Bellows was astride a window sill. He was </p><p>in a fair way to escape when the red-haired </p><p>girl, swift to discern a heaven-sent oppor- </p><p>tunity for revenge, hurled herself across the </p><p>intervening space and wound her arms </p><p>about his leg. Bellows, snarling, sought to </p><p>draw his six-shooter. </p><p> Both Henderson’s guns were out of reach,</p><p>but lie had one card left to play. His right </p><p>hand flashed to the back of his neck. There </p><p>was a twinkle of steel in the lamplight, a </p><p>vicious whir in the smoky air, and Sam </p><p>Bellows, a nine-inch bowie pinning his left </p><p>hand to his thigh, fell back into the room. </p><p> By the time Henderson, Kansas Casey</p><p>and the quiet-eyed citizen, Kane, had </p><p>bandaged Sam Bellows, Chuck Morgan </p><p>returned marching ahead of him the fiddler </p><p>and Mr. Tom Stute. The latter, his </p><p>broken arm still in a sling, was attired </p><p>solely in a nightshirt. </p><p> “Caught Stute slidin’ out to his corral</p><p>when I was goin’ after the fiddler,” ex- </p><p>plained Chuck Morgan. </p><p> “I was feeling feverish,” averred Mr.</p><p>Stute, forcing a smile. “I guess I was a </p><p>little delirious perhaps. What’s all the </p><p>row about?” </p><p> “We’re gomia find out,” Henderson told</p><p>him. “ J ust as soon as the lady on the floor </p><p>comes to we’re gonna shore find out.”</p><p> Mr. Stute found no comfort in the words.</p><p>He was seen to lick his lips and nervously </p><p>rub one bare ankle against the other. He </p><p>looked glumly at Sam Bellows. </p><p> The fiddler said nothing. He was agi-</p><p>tatedly gnawing his nails and staring about </p><p>him with scared eyes. In this he was at </p><p>one with many another in the Dewdrop </p><p>Dance-Hall. </p><p> “Whu-where’s that ghost?” the fiddler</p><p>asked suddenly. </p><p> “Where is he?” demanded Kansas Casey,</p><p>scrambling to his feet. In the hurry of </p><p>the bustling moment he had forgotten the </p><p>apparition of Rufe Thompson. So, appar- </p><p>ently, had Henderson. </p><p> “I dunno,” said Henderson blankly.</p><p>“Ain’t he here?” </p><p> “I—I seen him disappear right where he</p><p>was standin’ in the doorway,” quavered </p><p>Dolan. “He went out like yuh’d blow out </p><p>a candle.” </p><p> “He did, huh?” snickered Henderson.</p><p>“Yuh got eyes like a eagle, Dolan.” </p><p> “I seen him,” insisted Dolan. “I was</p><p>lookin’ right at him.” </p><p> “Yore imagination is a bird,” grinned</p><p>Henderson. “I’m tellin’ yuh— by Gawd! </p><p>Where’s that barkeep?” </p><p> Henderson ran behind the bar. The</p><p>bartender had vanished. Henderson ran </p><p>out into the street. From afar off sounded </p><p>the faint tuck-a-lnck, tuck-a-tuck of gallop- </p><p>ing horses. The slurring drum dwindled, </p><p>died out. Henderson reentered the dance- </p><p>hall. </p><p> “Guess the barkeep’s sloped,” he said to</p><p>the multitude. “Anybody gone for Jake </p><p>Rule?” he asked of Kansas Casey. </p><p> “I sent Dockery for him,” said Kansas.</p><p>“Say, Henderson, who was that—that </p><p>ghost?” </p><p> “Yeah, who was he?” others wished to</p><p>know, gazing fearfully the while at the </p><p>doorway.</p><p> “Plenty o’ time for explanation later,”</p><p>replied Henderson. “They’s no hurry </p><p>a-tall. The lady’s cornin’ to,” he added, </p><p>glancing down at the prostrate brunette. </p><p> The brunette recovered consciousness</p><p>gaspingly. </p><p> “Oh!” she whispered when she could</p><p>speak. “The ghost! The ghost!” </p><p> “Shore, the ghost,” said Henderson help-</p><p>fully. “Happened in quite handy, didn’t </p><p>he? Can yuh sit up?” </p><p> Without waiting for a reply he slipped</p><p>his hands beneath her armpits, lifted her </p><p>gently and slid her on a chair. </p><p> ENTERED then Jake Rule and</p><p> *r the marshal and pushed their way</p><p> through the crowd.</p><p> “What’s up?” asked Jake.</p><p> “The lady’s gonna tell us,” Henderson</p><p>said softly. </p><p>High Pockets </p><p>57 </p><p> But the lady was not going to do anything</p><p>of the kind. She said so profanely. </p><p> “Mightaswell,” warned Henderson. “You</p><p>told quite a lot when—the ghost came in.” </p><p>The brunette shuddered, but remained </p><p>silent. </p><p> “All right,” Henderson said. “I’ll just</p><p>tell yuh, Jake, what I’ve found out. About </p><p>two months ago Rufe Thompson was mur- </p><p>dered an’ robbed here in Farewell.” </p><p> “I didn’t know he was robbed,” cut in</p><p>Jake Rule. </p><p> “He was, all right. He was carryin’</p><p>three thousand dollars in a belt.” </p><p> “Then that’s why his shirt was pulled up</p><p>out o’ his pants!” exclaimed Kansas Casey. </p><p> “I expect,” said Henderson. “I come up</p><p>here to get the rights o’ the matter. Yuh </p><p>see, my name’s ain’t Henderson. It’s Derr, </p><p>Bill Derr.” </p><p> “Oh.” The sheriff’s eyes rounded saucer-</p><p>wise. “I’ve heard o’ you. Yo’re the feller </p><p>trailed down ‘Cutnose’ Canter an’ Rime </p><p>Tolliver an’ them other two jiggers that </p><p>time them four hundred an’ twelve hosses </p><p>was run off from the 88. Wasn’t they a </p><p>murder mixed up in that too?” </p><p> “They was,” nodded Bill Derr. “An’</p><p>it was the murder I was interested in, </p><p>not the hosses. But that ain’t got nothin’ </p><p>to do with this. Like I’m telling yuh, I </p><p>come up to this town. One night, when </p><p>the girls was all in here, I went through </p><p>them cribs out back an’ I found Rufe’s </p><p>money-belt under the mattress o’ that </p><p>black-haired woman’s bed.” </p><p> “That’s a lie!” shrilled that black-haired</p><p>woman. “Tom burned it!” </p><p> “Thanks,” Bill Derr said dryly. rtI kind</p><p>o’ hoped yuh wouldn’t swallow my li’l lie. </p><p>Tom, I guess this sort o’ cinches the hull on </p><p>you too.” </p><p> Mr. Stute, a pale body of a man, shrank</p><p>into himself. Derr turned to the brunette.</p><p> “Listen here. We’ve got Bellows an’</p><p>Tom Stute already, an’ the barkeep an’ the </p><p>fiddler are both under suspicion. Who else </p><p>was in this? Speak up. Don’t be afraid. </p><p>Turn State’s evidence an’ save yore neck.” </p><p>The brunette, held down in her chair by </p><p>two men, began to rave. </p><p> “Does that State’s evidence go for me?”</p><p>the fiddler asked swiftly. </p><p> Derr nodded coldly. The fiddler took a</p><p>long breath. </p><p> “Tom Stute, Longhorn an’ Lamp Black</p><p>planned it. They-” </p><p> “Kansas,” interrupted Jake Rule, “s’pose</p><p>you sift over to the Happy Heart an’ glom </p><p>on to Lamp Black. Go on,” he added to </p><p>the fiddler. </p><p> “The barkeep an’ me heard ’em ribbin’</p><p>up the dead an’—an’—that’s how we come </p><p>to know about it.” </p><p> “How much djuh get for keepin’ yore</p><p>mouths shut?” flashed Derr. </p><p> “Only a hundred apiece.”</p><p> “Yo’re shore cheap. G’on.”</p><p> “They didn’t wanna do the job them-</p><p>selves, so they picked Sam Bellows. He’d </p><p>come in after dark, put his hoss in Stute’s </p><p>corral an’ gone to sleep in Daisy’s room.” </p><p>The fiddler jerked his thumb at the hys- </p><p>terical brunette. “So, yuh see, nobody </p><p>’ceptin’ us six knowed anythin’ about </p><p>Bellows, an’ it looked easy. Daisy she </p><p>tolled Thompson out back o’ the stage </p><p>corrals an’ Bellows knifed him an’ pulled </p><p>his freight instanter with his share o’ the </p><p>money. An’—an’ that’s all.” </p><p> “It’s enough,” was Derr’s gently spoken</p><p>opinion. </p><p> “I appoint every man here a deputy</p><p>’ceptin’ the prisoners!” shouted the sheriff. </p><p>“Kane, you an’ Morgan guard ’em. The </p><p>rest o’ yuh get yore hosses. We’re a-goin’ </p><p>after that barkeep.” </p><p> “I don’t hardly think it’s necessary,”</p><p>interposed Henderson. “I didn’t tell yuh</p><p>that I heard three-four hosses punchin’ the </p><p>breeze when I went outside after the </p><p>barkeep. I guess the jigger is bein’ at- </p><p>tended to. Here comes Kansas.” </p><p> The deputy was the leader of a large dele-</p><p>gation from the Happy Heart, of which dele- </p><p>gation the desired Lamp Black was not one. </p><p>“Where’s Lamp?” queried the sheriff. </p><p>“He’s back there,” replied Kansas Casey. </p><p>“He went after his gun when I throwed </p><p>down on him. I guess he must ’a’ sus- </p><p>picioned somethin’.” </p><p> “He’s saved us trouble,” said the sheriff.</p><p>“Kansas, take one o’ the boys an’ go out to </p><p>the 88 an’ watch Simms till he’s able to </p><p>ride. Who’s this? Why—by Gawd!” </p><p> The question and expletive were called</p><p>forth by the precipitate entry of the Dew- </p><p>drop barkeeper and Rufe Thompson’s ghost. </p><p>The ghost was prodding forward the bar- </p><p>keeper with the muzzle of a six-shooter. </p><p>Following the two men were the Rainbow </p><p>and Willie’s Old-Brother-in-Law. </p><p> “G’on, - yuh!” snarled the ghost.</p><p>“Whatcha waitin’ for?” </p><p>58 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> He gripped the bartender by the collar</p><p>and flung him sprawling at the sheriff’s feet. </p><p> “Dunno whether he’s wanted or not,”</p><p>went on the ghost, “but I seen him slide </p><p>out through a side window while I was </p><p>standin’ in the doorway. So me an’ Willie’s </p><p>Old-Brother-in-Law an’ his niece here took </p><p>out after him on suspicion. Whatcha find </p><p>out, Bill? Is he wanted?” </p><p> “Plenty, an’ he is,” replied Derr. “Kan-</p><p>sas Casey downed one a while ago, they’s </p><p>another sick abed-.out at the 88, an’ we got </p><p>the rest.” </p><p> He indicated bandaged Bellows and the</p><p>others with a sweep of his hand. The </p><p>ghost stared at them with smoldering eyes. </p><p>The spectators stared at the ghost. The </p><p>latter was obviously a flesh and blood </p><p>person, but he was an exact replica in </p><p>features, body, carriage and voice of the </p><p>dead Rufe Thompson. </p><p> “I shore wish the sheriff wasn’t here,”</p><p>said the newcomer simply. </p><p> “Say, stranger, who are you?” demanded</p><p>the sheriff. </p><p> “I’m Rufe Thompson’s brother Sile,”</p><p>was the answer. “I guess yuh didn’t know </p><p>we was twins, didja?” </p><p>BILL DERR, Chuck Morgan and </p><p>Thompson were the sole occupants </p><p>of the many-bedded room in the </p><p>hotel that night. </p><p> “Yuh done well, Bill,” observed Sile</p><p>Thompson, pulling off a boot. “Yuh </p><p>got’em quicker’n I thought yuh would. </p><p>When djuh begin to suspect ’em?” </p><p> “I had a hunch from the start that Tom</p><p>Stute an’ Simms was in it, but I didn’t know </p><p>for shore an’-” </p><p> “So that’s why y’only nicked ’em that-</p><p>away!” cried Chuck, bouncing upright on </p><p>his cot. </p><p> “Shore that’s why,” Henderson said</p><p>calmly. </p><p> “You’re got yore nerve!”</p><p> “I was scared to death alia time. Bet</p><p>I lost me a year’s growth. It was mostly </p><p>luck, anyway. I never expected no such </p><p>haul as we got tonight for my li’l surprise. </p><p>I only aimed to scare one o’ the women into </p><p>talkin’ some.” </p><p> “Didn’cha suspect Bellows at first?”</p><p>asked Thompson. </p><p> “Not when I sent the Rainbow an’ her</p><p>uncle after yuh I didn’t. I didn’t see him </p><p>till right before then anyhow. But when </p><p>I got to Marysville—an’ that was more </p><p>luck, ’cause I only went there on business </p><p>for a friend—I heard Dunlavy, the express </p><p>agent, tell the barkeep at the Sunrise that </p><p>they was a saddle, bridle, spurs an’ chaps, </p><p>from Blazier’s at Pueblo come for Sam </p><p>Bellows. </p><p> “Yuh know yuh can buy saddles up to</p><p>sixty-eighty dollars in Marysville, so I </p><p>knowed this saddle must be somethin’ </p><p>fancy—bridle, spurs an’ chaps likewise. </p><p>I was wonderin’ where Sam got all his </p><p>money. I asked ’round an’ I heard he’d </p><p>dropped more’n four hundred playin’ the </p><p>wheel in Marysville. Ten months’ wages </p><p>right there, an’ from all I could learn </p><p>Bellows ain’t the savin’ kind. Then it </p><p>come to me that Bellows was sort o’ brutal </p><p>with women, hosses an’ men.” </p><p> “An’ the man that killed Rufe was a</p><p>shore-’nough brute,” put in Sile Thompson </p><p>in a low voice. “Was that it?” </p><p> “It gave me the start of an idea. I asked</p><p>some more an’ I found out Bellows drifted </p><p>into Marysville two days after the murder. </p><p>I went to the 88 an’ they told me the date </p><p>when Bellows left there. Which date was </p><p>the mornin’ o’ the day Rufe was killed. So </p><p>I began to have more hopes than ever o’ </p><p>what would happen when you’d step into </p><p>the doorway o’ the Dewdrop.” </p><p> “I shore knowed it would work out when</p><p>I got yore letter. I dunno why I never </p><p>thought o’ the thing. It was so - </p><p>simple. Say, that Injun an’ his niece are </p><p>shore good people, an’ sly—Bill, we didn’t </p><p>see nobody but ourselves from the time </p><p>we left the Slash F till Sing Luey opened </p><p>the back door o’ the Canton.” </p><p> “I was figurin’ that’s how it would be,”</p><p>Bill Derr said sleepily. </p><p> In the morning Derr, watching his oppor-</p><p>tunity, walked into the Canton a few </p><p>minutes after the departure of the last </p><p>breakfaster. </p><p> “Yuh’ve heard how it turned out,” he</p><p>said to Sing Luey. </p><p> “It — turned out remarkably well,”</p><p>nodded Sing Luey, his Oriental features </p><p>inscrutable as ever. </p><p> “Yuh shore helped me out—” Derr began</p><p>awkwardly. </p><p> Sing Luey held up a deprecating hand.</p><p> “I am paid,” he said. “You have rid me</p><p>of two enemies. Stute and Simms once did </p><p>me an injury. They thought it did not </p><p>matter; that I did not matter. I waited. </p><p>High Pockets </p><p>59 </p><p>I could afford to wait. I knew my time </p><p>would come. It did. You saw.” </p><p> “You suspected them two from the</p><p>beginnin’, huh?” </p><p> “I did not suspect. I knew. But I had</p><p>no proof. You came. You, with my poor </p><p>help, obtained those proofs. Ah, I am </p><p>grateful. I will show you.” </p><p> He whipped from beneath his em-</p><p>broidered silk over-shirt a small figurine </p><p>of carved jade. Squat, hideously ugly, the </p><p>image sat upon Sing Luey’s yellow palm and </p><p>leered greenly at Bill Derr. </p><p> “This,” continued the Celestial, “is—</p><p>is—I can not tell you what it is in your </p><p>language. But it is very old. It is a </p><p>thousand years older than Kong-Fou- </p><p>Tse, and he died nearly five hundred years </p><p>before your God was born. It brings good </p><p>luck to whomsoever receives it as a gift. </p><p>To whomsoever steals it from the person </p><p>to whom it has been given it brings evil </p><p>and much sorrow. It was given to me, a </p><p>gift. I give it to you, a gift. Take it.” </p><p>He held it out. Bill Derr, making </p><p>nothing at all of Sing Luey’s words, thanked </p><p>the Chinaman, and thrust the figurine into </p><p>the breast pocket of his shirt, where it </p><p>cuddled his tobacco bag on one side and a </p><p>pencil stub on the other. </p><p> “Shake,” said Derr, extending his hand.</p><p>“Yo’re all right, Sing Luey. Any time yuh </p><p>want a favor done an’ I can do it, I’ll take </p><p>it kindly if yuh’ll call on me. Yuh know </p><p>where I live. Just lemme know, that’s all.” </p><p>“I’ll remember,” smiled Sing Luey, and </p><p>shook hands with Occidental firmness of </p><p>grip. </p><p> “So long,” said Bill Derr, and departed.</p><p>In the street he met Sile Thompson. </p><p>“Where you been?” asked Sile. “I been </p><p>chasin’ yuh all over. Got a proposition, </p><p>Bill. I w'as gonna tell yuh last night, but </p><p>you was too sleepy. I got a chance to buy </p><p>the Slash F. Wanna come in with me?” </p><p> “I ain’t got the money.”</p><p> “You got some. Don’t try to tell me</p><p>different. Put in whatcha got an’ pay the </p><p>rest o’ yore share out of the profits. In five </p><p>years we’ll be all square, even-Steven. Say </p><p>yes, cowboy, say yes.” </p><p> “Gimme a chance! Shut up an’ I will!</p><p>I’ll beller it plumb in yore ear! The </p><p>Slash F! That’s shore luck.” </p><p> Luck! He remembered the words of</p><p>Sing Luey. His hand flew to his breast </p><p>pocket. Through the thickness of flannel </p><p>his fingers pinched the jade figurine. Leav- </p><p>ing Sile Thompson all standing he hurried </p><p>off in the direction of the Blue Pigeon. </p><p> “Hey, where yuh goin’?” cried Sile</p><p>Thompson. </p><p> The retreating Henderson hunched a</p><p>shoulder by way of reply and continued on </p><p>his way. His lips moved silently. </p><p> “I’m gonna crowd that luck,” he was</p><p>saying to himself. “I’m shore gonna </p><p>crowd that luck for all it’s worth.” </p><p> Sile Thompson watched his friend enter</p><p>the Blue Pigeon Store. </p><p> “I’d shore admire to know what’s eatin’</p><p>Bill,” he muttered, and scratched a puzzled </p><p>head. “Guess maybe I’ll go see.” </p><p> At the door of the Blue Pigeon he met</p><p>Mike Flynn and Chuck Morgan coming </p><p>out. Mike closed the door softly, sat </p><p>down firmly on the sill and planted a wide </p><p>back against the door. Chuck Morgan </p><p>teetered on his heels and grinned idiotically. </p><p> “Say, I was goin’ in there,” Sile Thomp-</p><p>son said wrathfully. </p><p> “You was, but you ain’t,” chuckled Mike.</p><p> “What the"-”</p><p> “Come away where it’s cool, Thompson,”</p><p>urged the grinning Morgan. “Le’s go have </p><p>a drink, a lot o’ drinks.” </p><p> “I don’t want no drink. I wanna see</p><p>Bill. Whatsa matter with you fellers? </p><p>Y’all crazy, or what?” </p><p> “Shore we are. An’ Bill’s crazy too, all</p><p>same fox. C’mon.”</p><p> Sile Thompson went. He had to.</p><p> Later, when he came to see matters and</p><p>individuals in their proper light and place, </p><p>he quite agreed with Chuck Morgan that </p><p>Bill Derr was as mad as that notably intelli- </p><p>gent animal, the gray fox of the waste </p><p>places. </p><p>THE FRAYED STRAND </p><p> By</p><p>Roy P. Churchill </p><p>Author of "Ojf the Course,'' “Arabetc. </p><p>ONE thing which the men of the </p><p>U. S. S. Rainbow respected in </p><p>Boatswain’s Mate Dick Reason- </p><p>er was that he always stood to </p><p>an issue face to face. He might lay un- </p><p>cannily clever plans to make things come </p><p>out right, and dodge plain trouble when </p><p>there was just as good a way free from it, </p><p>but when a thing was squarely up to him, </p><p>he did not squirm and side-step to save his </p><p>face, but had it out, win or lose, right </p><p>there. </p><p> It was Wednesday afternoon, “Rope</p><p>Yarn Sunday,” and the Rainbow’s crew had </p><p>their kits and ditty-boxes strewn about the </p><p>forecastle while they sewed, wrote letters, </p><p>and gossiped. A homey, peaceful scene, </p><p>and into, it Dick Reasoner fitted perfectly. </p><p>He sat on a sea-chest with his back to a </p><p>wire deck-locker full of scrubbers, squilgees, </p><p>swabs and paint rags, and read a book, </p><p>smiling sometimes as if it was a funny story, </p><p>and again scowling intently as if it might be </p><p>a drill manual. </p><p> But the book was neither. It was a</p><p>dictionary, and its well-thumbed pages had </p><p>earned for Dick Reasoner the nickname, </p><p>“Dictionary Dick,” and the right from his </p><p>shipmates to expect that he would help </p><p>them out of their troubles. </p><p> Today Reasoner smiled little. He</p><p>searched the book for help in a difficult </p><p>problem, and presently Clay McCune came </p><p>and sat beside him, bringing the matter to a </p><p>point. Reasoner slipped the little book </p><p>60 </p><p>into his blouse. Compared to McCune, he </p><p>was solid, steady-eyed and bulwarklike, and </p><p>his smile was an invitation to the other man </p><p>to unload. </p><p> Clay McCune was almost as tall as</p><p>Reasoner, but slighter in build, with slim, </p><p>sinewy hands and brilliantly fascinating </p><p>dark eyes which had in them also a keen </p><p>restlessness, as if his soul walked back and</p><p>forth behind them as a caged beast behind </p><p>bars. </p><p> McCune took a hurried look about him,</p><p>and lowered his voice. </p><p> “I’m going to jump,” he said, with a bare</p><p>shade of defiance which was not necessary </p><p>with Reasoner. </p><p> “I’ve seen it coming since we dropped</p><p>anchor,” said Reasoner. </p><p> Then he swept his arm out toward the</p><p>rim of the crescent bay where Port An- </p><p>tonio lay tucked in at the foot of the moun- </p><p>tains. </p><p> “It is this?” he asked.</p><p> McCune nodded, and without speaking</p><p>the two looked shoreward across the bay. </p><p>Between the shimmering blue water, with </p><p>its strip of white beach, and the towering </p><p>bulk of Santa Inez Mountain with its lights </p><p>and shadows of tropic green, the town was </p><p>a bright splash of color, with its red roofs </p><p>and its gay flags, brilliant in the sunlight. </p><p>Truly it was a port of romance, and to this </p><p>place chance had brought Clay McCune </p><p>and his trouble-begetting rashness, when </p><p>the boy needed cool, sober remolding} </p><p>The Frayed Strand </p><p>61 </p><p>something to curb the wanderlust, too high- </p><p>pitched in this soul. </p><p> “I thought I’d tell you,” McCune broke</p><p>the silence apologetically. “It’s due you. </p><p>You’ve tried hard, but this place was made </p><p>for me. The call is so strong it breaks </p><p>down everything else. A canoe from shore </p><p>is coming out to get me.” </p><p> Dick Reasoner did not argue. McCune</p><p>had made his choice against his sworn word, </p><p>against allegiance to his country, against the </p><p>confidence of his friends who had plead that </p><p>he be given one more chance. So Reasoner </p><p>said nothing. True, he could have him put </p><p>in the brig, and held him by force, but this </p><p>was not Reasoner’s way. If he had failed </p><p>with McCune, having the man in the brig </p><p>would not turn the defeat into victory. </p><p> “I don’t want you to feel bad,” McCune</p><p>continued. “You’ve done all you could. </p><p>Old HippoleFerez is going to hide me until the </p><p>ship sails, and then make me captain of his </p><p>machine-gun company. I’m telling you all </p><p>about it, because I know you won’t snitch.” </p><p>McCune’s eyes sparkled, and he looked </p><p>steadily at Reasoner. For the moment his </p><p>restlessness had given way to purpose. </p><p>Reasoner smiled enigmatically. </p><p> “I hope it turns out all right, Clay, but</p><p>old Ferez will do to watch.” </p><p> “What do you mean? He can’t afford</p><p>to double-cross me.” </p><p> “You can’t tell. Just look out, boy.</p><p>There’s a word in the book that mighty few </p><p>spiggoties know anything about. Far as </p><p>that goes, a lot of us miss its real meaning. </p><p>It’s ‘loyalty.’ Notice how it sounds, warm </p><p>and comforting and smooth, but it has </p><p>force in it, too. Just as if it was a strap- </p><p>ping six-footer leading along little sister by </p><p>the hand.” </p><p> “I’m sick of lectures, Dick. I know what</p><p>you’re driving at, and who you’re aiming at. </p><p>What if the outfit did take me back and </p><p>give me another chance after I’d had a </p><p>dozen? What if the judge did say that </p><p>the Navy was no place for bad characters </p><p>and put it up to the commandant whether to</p><p>send me back or to send me up for two </p><p>years? </p><p> “I know all about how the commandant</p><p>put it up to the captain, and the captain </p><p>put it up to you, and what a bunch of young </p><p>fellows you’ve shoved over on the right side </p><p>when they started to lean. But it won’t do </p><p>with me. I’m sorry, Dick. I like you, and </p><p>I like the outfit, and I honestly thought I </p><p>might make it if I had another trial. But </p><p>what’s the use? I’m not built for steady </p><p>going.” </p><p> “I didn’t mean to lecture,” said Reasoner,</p><p>“and I want no praise. All I’ve done is to </p><p>put the things before you. Maybe you’ll </p><p>hit the right course some day. This may </p><p>be the one. I hope so, Clay, but I don’t </p><p>trust Port Antonio. She’s a witch and a </p><p>siren. She had a rainbow over her like a </p><p>crown this morning, and I can feel myself </p><p>swing out toward her to the end of the an- </p><p>chor chain. That’s what you need, Clay, </p><p>an anchor, something to swing to. That’s </p><p>what you lack. Get you one, Clay.” </p><p> The young man stretched out his arms</p><p>toward the city. </p><p> “It’s over there, Dick. I feel it!”</p><p> Reasoner shook his head in warning.</p><p> “Not old Ferez and his machine-gun</p><p>captaincy. Not that slim, wild, half-white </p><p>dancer at the Independencia, nor the indo- </p><p>lent luxury of the long soft days. They’ll </p><p>pass just as the other bright things that you </p><p>have tried to tie to have passed. It’s </p><p>something inside. I’ve tried hard to find </p><p>it for you, and have failed. But before you </p><p>go, I’m offering you the word from the </p><p>little book—the one I told you about, </p><p>‘loyalty.’ If you could shackle to that </p><p>somehow you’d be safe anywhere.” </p><p> Dick Reasoner was nearer to winning</p><p>Clay McCune at that moment than at any </p><p>other time. Impulsively McCune turned. </p><p> “I’ll stay, then, Dick!” he cried.</p><p> Reasoner was not elated.</p><p> “Think it over,” he advised.</p><p> He J*new too well McCune’s habit of</p><p>good resolves quickly broken. Then the </p><p>two sat silently again, looking out to sea, </p><p>and around the trim white deck with its </p><p>contented groups at their homely tasks </p><p>among the black gun-muzzles, and after a </p><p>time McCune’s eyes turned again toward </p><p>the city, and he decided as Reasoner knew </p><p>he would. </p><p> “I’m going, Dick. All this stuff has lost</p><p>out with me. I’d be booze-fighting, liberty- </p><p>breaking, trouble-making, again in no time. </p><p>I’m not really deserting. I’m trying to keep </p><p>out of trouble. Maybe that anchor you </p><p>have been talking about is over there.” </p><p> “Look for it, Clay,” said Reasoner, and</p><p>the two parted. </p><p> The next morning Clay McCune did not</p><p>answer to muster, and ten days later he was </p><p>posted as a deserter. </p><p>62 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>wide </p><p>I BETWEEN being a guest at Port </p><p>Antonio and being a resident, Clay </p><p>McCune soon found there was a </p><p>ifference. The Rainbow had gone, </p><p>and no longer did he hide himself at Senor </p><p>Ferez’s inland plantation, while the marines </p><p>came ashore -and went through the usual </p><p>haunts of sailors to find him. He was </p><p>dressed now in the uniform of a captain, </p><p>and on fete days was bedecked in much gold </p><p>lace, and a sword, which tripped him. </p><p> But no longer was he a guest. Port</p><p>Arftonio threw back the veil, so that he </p><p>could see beneath the rice powder and the </p><p>gaiety and the feasting, and he found her </p><p>more than a witch and a siren. She was </p><p>also a cat with sharp claws in her velvet </p><p>pads. He found himself only the present </p><p>favorite of Vesta, the dancing girl at the </p><p>Independencia, the last of a dozen captains </p><p>of the machine-gun company, one of the </p><p>city’s small group of aliens, a paid mer- </p><p>cenary. </p><p> Yet in Clay McCune there was a quality</p><p>which those before him had not had. True </p><p>his skin was white, but his heart was restless, </p><p>impulsive, unstable, which gave him a soul </p><p>kinship with those among whom he lived. </p><p> For all that, McCune felt himself apart,</p><p>in fact, drew himself apart, after the manner </p><p>of all men whose skin is white, and in the </p><p>councils where Hippole Ferez dictated and </p><p>intrigued and schemed to hold his place, </p><p>McCune had no part, but did his work as </p><p>he was told. </p><p> “Almost, Senor El Capitan; you are one</p><p>of us,” Ferez had praised him, when the </p><p>company had come back from the prompt </p><p>quelling of an incipient revolution, and now </p><p>something bigger was on. </p><p> McCune felt it, but could not place it.</p><p>Deference itself was the dictator, and Suave </p><p>and Polite his satellites, but it was through </p><p>the girl at the Independencia that he found </p><p>out, and that almost by accident. </p><p> They were sitting in the little restaurant</p><p>next to the theater, whose patio overlooked</p><p>the bay. </p><p> “Here’s to he whom the Bull trusts,” she</p><p>said, holding up the yellow wine to the moon </p><p>before she brought it to her lips. </p><p> “Bull?” questioned McCune, the words</p><p>rousing him from the dreamy seductiveness </p><p>of Port Antonio at night, which had not yet </p><p>lost its charm. </p><p> “Senor Ferez. He is the Bull. With the</p><p>people, it is his name.” </p><p> “So you think he trusts me?”</p><p> “Si, senor, why not? Do you not go soon</p><p>on a mission of importance? Those who </p><p>kill for Senor Ferez he trusts.” </p><p> McCune feigned indifference.</p><p> “Where do you get this idle gossip?” he</p><p>bantered. “You know nothing.” </p><p> Piqued, the dancing girl drained her glass,</p><p>and turned on him half-angrily. She </p><p>would show this Americano just how deep </p><p>she was in her country’s schemes. </p><p> “Listen,” she said, lowering her voice.</p><p>“Does not Estreda yet live unconquered at </p><p>La Combra? Is he not rich? Has not the </p><p>ship of war Americano gone to a safe </p><p>distance?” </p><p> McCune was startled, and misunder-</p><p>standing his emotion, the girl continued- </p><p> “Did the Americano think that Senor</p><p>Ferez, the Bull, brought him to dress and </p><p>to play?” </p><p> The words stung McCune, but he kept his</p><p>temper, and answered evenly. </p><p> “All right, Vesta, my girl, I’m sick of in-</p><p>action, anyhow.” </p><p> There was a note of exultation in his</p><p>voice which surprised the dancer. It was </p><p>this quality of unexpectedness in him which </p><p>kept her wondering. Almost he was one of </p><p>them, as Ferez had said. </p><p> “I hope, then,” she changed instantly,</p><p>“that Ferez makes you a general and that </p><p>you come back to me safely. You are to</p><p>head the expedition, my Americano.” </p><p>McCune did not doubt the girl’s story, </p><p>for he knew a little of the complete dominion </p><p>over the island which Ferez coveted, and of </p><p>the defiance of a smaller neighbor, who had </p><p>already beaten off an ill-timed invasion. </p><p>Now McCune knew why ammunition for </p><p>target practise had been plentiful, drills </p><p>multiplied, and the picked men placed in </p><p>the machine-gun company with two modern </p><p>guns. </p><p> In the few days that followed Ferez’s veri-</p><p>fication of the dancing girl’s story, McCune </p><p>became better acquainted with his chief. </p><p>They were together a great deal, Ferez </p><p>directing, driving, scheming, and McCune </p><p>began to know why his people called him </p><p>affectionately and half-fearfully, the Bull. </p><p>A week later they brought their little army </p><p>safely over the mountain trails, each man </p><p>well-fed, well-armed and confident, to a </p><p>smaller crescent bay, and the town of </p><p>La Combra. </p><p> The attack was less of a surprise than</p><p>The Frayed Strand </p><p>63 </p><p>Ferez had hoped. At the edge of the town </p><p>they met scouting parties and sentries, </p><p>defeated them with small loss, and then </p><p>fighting from house to house drove Estreda </p><p>and a remnant of his followers to the Gov- </p><p>ernment house in the plaza. Here the </p><p>defenders made their prepared stand, and </p><p>three desperate charges had failed to dis- </p><p>lodge them. Nightfall found the scattered </p><p>inhabitants gaining confidence, coming back </p><p>to their houses, and some bolder spirits </p><p>creeping in to join Estreda with another </p><p>gun, or another small store of food and </p><p>ammunition. </p><p> “The last time, for three days we did not</p><p>come so far,” Ferez told his leaders con- </p><p>fidently. “Tomorrow we will take the place </p><p>by storm.” </p><p> Clay McCune was happy. The day had</p><p>been full of thrills with its quick changes of </p><p>fortune, and Ferez had praised the work of </p><p>the deadly machine-guns more than once. </p><p>The two made a tour of the camp, inspect- </p><p>ing the sentries strung around the hostile </p><p>buildings in the center of the plaza. </p><p> “Today is proof we made no mistake in</p><p>our captain the Americano,” said Ferez. </p><p>“When we get back, the captain will find he </p><p>had made no mistake in us. He shall have </p><p>more than the prize he has already taken.” </p><p> At daylight the wily Estreda sent a mes-</p><p>senger with a flag of truce. Warfare still </p><p>held to its historic code in Antonio. Es- </p><p>treda warned that he would resist to the </p><p>last, that his store of food and ammunition </p><p>was ample, and that reinforcements were on </p><p>the way. </p><p> “Only the beaten talk thus,”' replied</p><p>Ferez, and sent his men to the attack with </p><p>new vigor. From house to house and wall </p><p>to wall they closed in on Estreda’s strong- </p><p>hold, making short rushes from cover to </p><p>cover. </p><p> Estreda’s thick brick building was in the</p><p>center of a walled-in court, pierced with </p><p>loopholes. It was against this outer wall </p><p>that Ferez had thrown his men in the pre- </p><p>ceding attacks, and against which he had </p><p>failed in the first invasion. Now Clay</p><p>McCune swept the loopholes on the wall </p><p>clear with the machine-guns, so that Ferez’s </p><p>men climbed up and chased the defenders in </p><p>a rout to the house itself. </p><p> Through the wall a wide gate led down an</p><p>avenue of palms to the house. Half-way </p><p>in was a fountain, around which the walk </p><p>and, the palm border curved gracefully. This </p><p>walk and fountain were the work of Estreda’s </p><p>predecessor, and also the means of his down- </p><p>fall, for Estreda had pointed out the luxury </p><p>to the “great common people,” slipped into </p><p>power on account of it, and became in turn </p><p>the possessor of its splendor. </p><p> But an election impended, and patriotic-</p><p>ally he had dried up the fountain, and let </p><p>grass grow between the bricks of the pave- </p><p>ment, so that what once had been his </p><p>secret pride was now his advertisement of </p><p>economy, and by the queer fortunes of war </p><p>might become his undoing. </p><p> Still protected by the machine-guns,</p><p>Ferez’s soldiers broke open the huge iron </p><p>gate and crept to the fountain. Inside it on </p><p>the dried mud with its wisps of dead ferns </p><p>and water lilies, they were safe from rifie- </p><p>fire from the house, and a group of picked </p><p>men gathered for another dash forward, </p><p>while they answered the shots from the </p><p>windows of the house. </p><p> Ferez and McCune stood safely in an</p><p>angle of the wall by the gate. </p><p> “We could wheel them inside,” said</p><p>McCune of the guns. “A little to one side </p><p>so that the palms would not interfere, then </p><p>keep the windows clear while the rush was </p><p>made. With a beam to break in the door, </p><p>the place will be ours in ten minutes. That </p><p>fountain gives us a ready-made bullet-proof </p><p>dug-out.” </p><p> Ferez beamed. His captain was truly a</p><p>rich find. Step by step he had cleared the </p><p>way with the guns, and they had not </p><p>jammed once. There seemed an uncanny </p><p>brotherhood between their death-dealing </p><p>black muzzles with their complicated, sen- </p><p>sitive interiors, and this Americano. In </p><p>consequence of it, his loss had been only </p><p>enough to make his men bold, eager, and to </p><p>add to their spirits. </p><p> “It is well, senor,” said Ferez. “I will</p><p>give the order to get the beam ready, and </p><p>fill Estreda’s fountain to the brim with my </p><p>best fighting men, and you, my Captain, be </p><p>careful, for after all, there must be a leader, </p><p>and one such is worth a fountain full of the </p><p>bravest.” </p><p>A MESSENGER stopped the prep- </p><p>aration, for so urgent was his news </p><p>that Ferez and McCune ran across </p><p>the bullet-swept plaza to the roof of a house </p><p>on its border, where protected by a facade </p><p>from the shots behind them, they could see </p><p>the harbor. </p><p>64 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “It’s the Rainbow!” exclaimed McCune,</p><p>hardly believing that it could be true, yet </p><p>while they looked the American warship </p><p>came to a stop, the anchor chain went out </p><p>with a rumble, as boat booms were rigged </p><p>out, and gangways dropped in place, in true </p><p>man-o’-war style. The Rainbow’s captain </p><p>had been on this station too long not to </p><p>know the value of the unexpected. He </p><p>had implied that the Rainbow was going to </p><p>her base, and then run back to see how his </p><p>charges were behaving. </p><p> “What is the custom?” demanded Ferez,</p><p>furious at the interruption, with victory in </p><p>sight. “What will be done?” </p><p> An hour later he could have had the</p><p>captain ashore for dinner, and all would </p><p>have been well. But what now? </p><p> “Quick, Senor McCune!” he urged.</p><p> McCune shook his head.</p><p> “I’m afraid it’s all off. I have seen them</p><p>do this too often. They’ll come ashore. </p><p>Estreda will tell them all about it, and we </p><p>will either have to go home in peace, or be </p><p>chased away by the Rainbow's guns.” </p><p> “But we have the victory,” argued</p><p>Ferez. “You say so yourself. Estreda is </p><p>beaten. Why is it they should take sides </p><p>with him against me, instead of me against </p><p>him? I’m the stronger, is it not so?” </p><p>“Hard luck,” said McCune, “but the </p><p>trouble is that we recognize the ‘Ins’ </p><p>against the ‘Outs’ every time.” </p><p> “We?” questioned Ferez.</p><p> A little sadly McCune pointed to the</p><p>gray ship. </p><p> “I beg pardon, senor, ‘they.’ There will</p><p>be an officer with a police guard at first, and </p><p>following that a landing party and heavy </p><p>guns, if both sides are not good. I’d call </p><p>the men and get safely out of the way, with </p><p>the machine-guns, of course. We have lost </p><p>mighty few as it is, and when the Rainbow </p><p>does get away—she won’t stay long if all </p><p>is quiet—we’ll slip down here again and do </p><p>the trick.” </p><p> For McCune the joy had gone out of the</p><p>adventure. He only wanted to get away </p><p>now safe from recognition. Ferez turned to </p><p>him with a well-feigned air of resignation. </p><p> “It is Fate, senor,” he shrugged. “I will</p><p>attend to everything. You had best get </p><p>away first. Take two men as a guard. On </p><p>the road outside the city I will join you. </p><p>As you say, perhaps another time we will be </p><p>more successful.” </p><p> As McCune slipped from the roof the boat</p><p>from the Rainbow came alongside the boat- </p><p>landing and discharged an officer and ten </p><p>sailors. McCune’s one idea as he dodged </p><p>along from building to building out of sight </p><p>of Estreda’s marksmen, was not to be seen </p><p>by his comrades.* He had not even both- </p><p>ered to take the guards that Ferez had </p><p>suggested. Then he slowed down, stopped, </p><p>and before he had gone half a dozen blocks, </p><p>he was creeping back stealthily, without </p><p>knowing the exact reason, unless as always </p><p>he was acting on impulse, and there had </p><p>been a glint in the back of Senor Ferez’s eye </p><p>as he so easily gave up a victory almost won. </p><p> Or it might have been that he came back</p><p>to see his comrades again, all in white, with </p><p>their jaunty hand-sewed hats, loose blouses </p><p>and flaring trousers. White, too, of skin, </p><p>and clean all through. How long had it </p><p>been since he had seen ten men, all white, </p><p>together? Whatever his motive, it found </p><p>him at last on a roof, overlooking the plaza, </p><p>and this is what he saw. </p><p> First, Senor Ferez had not withdrawn his</p><p>men, and the plaza was strangely, ominous- </p><p>ly silent. Only an occasional shot from a </p><p>roof, from a doorway, from the fountain in </p><p>the courtyard, kept Estreda’s men in their </p><p>places, and they had almost ceased to </p><p>answer since help was at hand, for Estreda </p><p>knew the rule that the “Ins” should be </p><p>protected, and wondered a little at Ferez’s </p><p>stupidity in not getting his men away while </p><p>he could. </p><p> McCune was puzzled at first, but from his</p><p>vantage-point he could see every detail. </p><p>Ferez had withdrawn his men from the </p><p>shoreward side of the plaza and wall. The </p><p>two macliine-guns were hidden in a flaring </p><p>angle beside the gate. This left the street </p><p>up which the sailors marched clear. It had</p><p>the appearance of being deserted and harm- </p><p>less. </p><p> Close against the courtyard wall came the</p><p>landing-party from the Rainbow. Ensign </p><p>Jennings was two paces ahead of the little </p><p>column of twos headed by Dick Reasoner. </p><p>Even at that distance McCune recognized </p><p>Reasoner’s breadth of shoulder, and his half- </p><p>slou'ching, yet springy step, and his whole </p><p>appearance of latent power and strength </p><p>held in reserve. His heart moved out </p><p>toward this man. He was glad to see him </p><p>again. Dictionary Dick at least had been </p><p>patient and kind and long-suffering. </p><p> So taken was McCune with this that the</p><p>column was a third of the way down the </p><p>The Frayed Strand </p><p>65 </p><p>wall toward the gate, before the full mean- </p><p>ing of Ferez’s trickery came to him, for </p><p>inside the courtyard in the abandoned foun- </p><p>tain'Ferez had made a new disposition of his </p><p>forces. Of the twenty men who were </p><p>sheltered there, only two had their rifles </p><p>pointed at Estreda’s house. The others </p><p>faced the wide gate, rifles laid along the edge </p><p>of the cracked cement. Also across the </p><p>courtyard outside the wall, ladders had been </p><p>placed, and more rifles pointed from the </p><p>wrong side of the loopholes toward the </p><p>gate entrance. </p><p> Ferez had not meant to give up, after all.</p><p>Since the American ship had come unex- </p><p>pectedly, it should help instead of hindering </p><p>his plans. At least in this way there was a </p><p>bare chance, better than ignominiously ac- </p><p>cepting defeat. The plan was very simple. </p><p>When the sailors came from behind the </p><p>shelter of the wall and into the gateway, he </p><p>would open fire on them from the fountain, </p><p>and from the wall almost behind Estreda’s </p><p>house. There were eleven, and some, one or </p><p>two, perhaps, would escape to the ship with </p><p>the story that the house in the plaza had </p><p>fired on them. </p><p> In the meantime, Ferez would withdraw</p><p>his men, to the flanking houses outside the </p><p>wall, still keeping Estreda’s men at bay </p><p>inside the courtyard. Then on them would </p><p>fall the wrath of the ship’s guns, and Es- </p><p>treda’s power would be wiped out forever. </p><p>Yes, it was a good plan. Ferez chuckled </p><p>over it, and on the opposite wall with his </p><p>sharpshooters waited to give the signal to </p><p>the picked men in the fountain. </p><p> Clay McCune had no struggle with him-</p><p>self as to what he should do, no false idea </p><p>of loyalty to his master, Bull Ferez. He </p><p>saw only that his shipmates, white men </p><p>like himself, his friend Dick Reasoner, were </p><p>about to go up against a deadly piece of </p><p>native trickery. He ran to the rear of the </p><p>low house, and slid feet first to the ground, </p><p>dodged around the buildings into the street, </p><p>and plunged madly forward across the plaza </p><p>toward the advancing sailors. He ran with </p><p>both hands up, shouting, “Stop!” and </p><p>spoiled utterly Ferez’s chance of surprise. </p><p> “Kill him,” ordered the dictator, and</p><p>gave the signal to fire. </p><p> Bullets thudded into the dust, glanced</p><p>from the scattered paving blocks, and </p><p>slipped by overhead almost silently with </p><p>their cold breath of death, but at this un- </p><p>expected appearance of the gringo gone </p><p>amuck, Ferez’s men fired uncertainly, and </p><p>McCune made the shelter of the wall un- </p><p>hurt, and jumped across the deadly gate en- </p><p>trance, in time to be recognized, and his </p><p>warning understood. </p><p> But Bull Ferez was not one to give up</p><p>easily. His hand had been forced, but he </p><p>meant to play it out. There was still left a </p><p>good opportunity to make an attack on the </p><p>sailors, and have it credited to Estreda, if </p><p>only McCune were killed, and on this </p><p>chance he signaled his picked men in the </p><p>bowl of the fountain to charge. Ignoring </p><p>the fact that Estreda might open fire at </p><p>their backs, they obeyed their chief prompt- </p><p>ly, ran down the palm-bordered walk, and </p><p>burst from the gate, firing as they came. </p><p> Instead of a surprised, uncertain group</p><p>in close order, which Ferez had counted on </p><p>routing in a swift attack, the native soldiers </p><p>met prepared resistance, for McCune had </p><p>seen them coming as he crossed the gate, </p><p>and flat on their faces, deployed to the best </p><p>advantage, the sailors poured in a searching </p><p>volley at close range, which sent the soldiers </p><p>hurrying back to the gate’s ornamental </p><p>approaches, and what shelter they could </p><p>find for sniping. </p><p> Ferez stormed impotently, first at the</p><p>failure of his plan, and then at his own men </p><p>as group after group lying quiescent in the </p><p>surrounding buildings according to orders, </p><p>joined the fight against the sailors. To </p><p>fight gringoes, especially when they were </p><p>outnumbered, was a chance in a lifetime, </p><p>and they were rapidly getting out of hand. </p><p> “There are too many for us,” said En-</p><p>sign Jennings. “We’li get out of this. </p><p>Fall back, and take advantage of all cover </p><p>until we can find a better place to hold </p><p>them.” </p><p> Dodging swiftly across the plaza, stop-</p><p>ping to fire from tree trunks, and door- </p><p>ways, the sailors made their way to the </p><p>mouth of the street which led to the beach,</p><p>carrying their wounded with them. </p><p> “We’ll signal for help from here,” decided</p><p>Ensign Jennings. “Johnson is bad hit, and </p><p>it hurts him to be carried without a </p><p>stretcher.” </p><p> But already the landing-party in force</p><p>was under way. The Rainbow’s captain </p><p>had heard the outburst of firing, and knew </p><p>the country too well to take a chance. The </p><p>sight of the crowded boats speeding to the </p><p>rescue, and the toll which the sailors’ rifles </p><p>had taken, brought Ferez’s men to their </p><p>66 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>senses. Hastily he collected them, cursing </p><p>his officers, threatening to shoot any man </p><p>who disobeyed, and by the time the landing- </p><p>party had climbed the hilly street to the </p><p>small detail entrenched and ready, even the </p><p>sniping had ceased, and Ferez’s whole ex- </p><p>pedition, with even his wounded and dead, </p><p>was on its way back over the mountain to its </p><p>own city. </p><p> Estreda sent down his white flag, was</p><p>voluble in his explanations, and begged for </p><p>protection from “the bandit of the north.” </p><p>So evident was the truth of his story, </p><p>coupled with McCune’s evidence, that the </p><p>captain granted his plea for recognition as a </p><p>permanent “In,” which had been denied </p><p>before, and after a week’s inspection and </p><p>the cleaning up of several reform measures, </p><p>the Rainbow sailed away, leaving the es- </p><p>timable Seiior Estreda happy and estab- </p><p>lished, safe from marauding neighbors, and </p><p>assured of reelection, if the machinery which </p><p>so far had never failed, continued to work. </p><p> THE manner of McCune’s coming</p><p>Pgpl back aboard the Rainbow elevated </p><p>him far above an ordinary deserter, </p><p>and a scuttle-butt rumor got about that his </p><p>punishment was to be light. So far he had </p><p>taken his place in his old division, and swung </p><p>his hammock in his old billet. In due </p><p>course of time, preferably when officers </p><p>from another ship could take part, there </p><p>would be a court-martial. There was </p><p>method in this, for the captain wanted to see </p><p>how McCune would knuckle down to work </p><p>after his experience ashore. </p><p> “McCune’s making good,” announced</p><p>“Slim” Higgins. “He’s settling down like </p><p>a fellow whose chief sport was collecting </p><p>hash marks.” </p><p> Dick Reasoner agreed heartily, too</p><p>heartily, and Slim caught the false note. </p><p> “You’re not sure!”</p><p> “Nothing’s sure.” said Reasoner, “but</p><p>why poke into things with the sharp end </p><p>of a stick? He’s doing all right now, let’s </p><p>help him.” </p><p> Reasoner wouldn’t admit, even to his</p><p>friend Slim Higgins, that there was the </p><p>shadow of a doubt in his mind, lest in some </p><p>way it might throw a straw in the path of </p><p>Clay McCune, but Reasoner couldn’t help </p><p>remembering that McCune had come back </p><p>from each of his exploits with the same </p><p>chastened spirit, the same earnest taking </p><p>up of the ship’s routine, the same pledges to </p><p>stick, in his words and in his work; and each </p><p>time there had crept in finally the old un- </p><p>rest, the old rebellion, which led him in the </p><p>end thrill-questing to disaster. </p><p> To Reasoner, Clay McCune had not</p><p>made a deciding choice when he slid from </p><p>the roof and ran across the plaza under fire </p><p>to save the landing-party from slaughter. </p><p>His choice had been one that few men could </p><p>refuse, since Ferez had tricked him, and </p><p>men of his own blood were in danger of </p><p>death. Reasoner took it as a good and </p><p>hopeful omen in the man’s character, but </p><p>not as conclusive evidence. </p><p> The week in the harbor at La Combra</p><p>was followed by a week at sea. The Rain- </p><p>bow's captain had a habit of running away </p><p>now and then to deep, open water to clear </p><p>his brain, and that of his crew, of the island’s </p><p>witchery of indolent carelessness, its cease- </p><p>less fermenting of selfish interests. These </p><p>days at sea were filled to the brim with drills, </p><p>with target-practise, with exacting routine, </p><p>but men and officers came back to theii </p><p>duties with new snap and decision to apply </p><p>to their work, with a wider perspective, be- </p><p>sides keeping the natives guessing which </p><p>port would receive the next call. </p><p> In that week Clay McCune’s presence</p><p>aboard the Rainbow became a matter of </p><p>course. He was fitted again to the ma- </p><p>chine, lost the savor of romance with which </p><p>his shipmates had clothed his desertion, and </p><p>in consequence suffered a return of his old </p><p>restlessness. </p><p> Then, as before, the Rainbow dropped</p><p>anchor in Port Antonio. For two days the </p><p>captain had impressed on Ferez the fact </p><p>that Estrada’s territory was tabu. It was </p><p>night of the second day—soft, warm, en- </p><p>chanting—and Reasoner and McCune sat </p><p>on the sea-chest with the old problem still </p><p>unsolved. </p><p> “They won’t let me go ashore,” com-</p><p>plained McCune. </p><p> “First-class men for daylight liberty</p><p>only,” said Reasoner. “Not even second- </p><p>class. What’d you expect with a court </p><p>martial hanging over you?” </p><p> McCune took the rebuke silently, but</p><p>after a moment spoke again. </p><p> “This grind is getting me, Dick. A week</p><p>of it seems like a year, and I thought that </p><p>maybe if they’d let me go ashore-” </p><p> “They won’t,” interrupted Reasoner.</p><p> “I know it, Dick. But what’s to keep me</p><p>from slipping ashore some night, this night, </p><p>The Frayed Strand </p><p>67 </p><p>if I like, and seeing the old haunts again? </p><p>The girl sent for me, you know. It would </p><p>help me to win out. I can get a boat easily; </p><p>give myself several hours ashore, and be </p><p>back a little after midnight.” </p><p> “Don’t do it!” cautioned Reasoner,</p><p>knowing as he spoke that McCune would </p><p>go that very night. </p><p> “I’ll have to taper off,” argued McCune.</p><p>“I can’t stop quick like this. This day-by- </p><p>day sameness is torture. I can take up the </p><p>fight better if I break away.” </p><p> “No,” said Reasoner firmly. “You don’t</p><p>pour oil on fire to put it out, nor starve any- </p><p>thing to death by feeding it. The trouble </p><p>is, Clay, you haven’t changed inside. You </p><p>don’t love the solid old Service. Don’t talk </p><p>to me about another fling helping you to win </p><p>out and fight better, for you’re not wanting </p><p>to settle down. You don’t want to give </p><p>up.” </p><p> “I guess you’re right,” said McCune,</p><p>smiling soberly, “but you’re a good old </p><p>scout, Dick, and I like you best when you </p><p>argue. I was cut off another pattern and </p><p>can’t be changed. Just as you say, I’m </p><p>going on this way to the end, because I like </p><p>it best. I might as well be frank with you, </p><p>and not try to hedge, but sometimes, a few </p><p>times—tonight is one—you make me wish </p><p>that I was a little more like you.” </p><p> Dick Reasoner left him pacing back and</p><p>forth across the forecastle, and a little later </p><p>from the bow came a soft call, and an </p><p>answer from the still water alongside. </p><p>McCune slipped down the anchor chain to a </p><p>waiting boat. </p><p> Reasoner might have argued with him at</p><p>length, preached about duty and loyalty, </p><p>called a marine sentry and had him locked </p><p>up, but Reasoner knew it would do no good, </p><p>for none of these things would change Clay </p><p>McCune, and with a feeling of helplessness </p><p>and failure, Reasoner began also to pace the </p><p>deck. </p><p> Vesta, the dancing girl at the Indepen-</p><p>dencia, stopped her sensuous whirl, the </p><p>musicians missed a beat, and the audience</p><p>turned in their chairs to look, as Clay </p><p>McCune walked down the theater’s center </p><p>aisle, and took a seat well forward. He had </p><p>changed clothes as he came ashore in the </p><p>native boat, and was dressed in the uniform </p><p>of a captain of the machine-gun company, </p><p>with its resplendent, many-colored trim- </p><p>mings. </p><p> As McCune took his seat amid the excited</p><p>whisperings of an audience impressed with </p><p>his bravado, two men of Ferez’s body-guard, </p><p>seated near the door behind him, slipped </p><p>unobtrusively out, their very stealthiness </p><p>making it plain that' they sought their </p><p>master. But unmolested McCune sat </p><p>through the program, and sent a note to the </p><p>dancing girl, then stood in the center of an </p><p>admiring group as the audience filed out, </p><p>staring, for this was the man—the wild </p><p>Americano—who had defied Bull Ferez, and </p><p>cost the dictator a rich province. </p><p> Bright-eyed with excitement, Vesta joined</p><p>him, and the two went to the restaurant ad- </p><p>joining, and into the patio which overlooked </p><p>the sea. </p><p> “You were foolish to come so openly,”</p><p>said the girl, tremulous with admiration, </p><p>and McCune caught her hand reassuringly. </p><p> “What is there to fear, little one? You</p><p>will notice that the sword which used to trip </p><p>me is gone, and I have in its place this. A </p><p>gift from Senor Ferez.” He took out and </p><p>placed on the table a heavy automatic pistol. </p><p>“We will have our wine. Ferez must get </p><p>word, must send picked men to make the </p><p>arrest, and by that time we will be gone.” </p><p>“Let us hurry, then,” pleaded Vesta. </p><p>“No,” said McCune, athrill with the </p><p>danger. </p><p> The pistol in easy reach gave him con-</p><p>fidence. He would play out this little fillip </p><p>as dramatically as he had begun it. </p><p> They had the patio to themselves, and</p><p>sat facing the door into the restaurant. </p><p>Well-shaded electric globes lighted the place. </p><p>A nervous waiter came in to serve them, and </p><p>spilled the wine as he poured it. Vesta </p><p>questioned him. His answers were vague, </p><p>and his eyes furtive. He seemed on the </p><p>point of flight at each sound from the </p><p>restaurant.</p><p> “I am afraid,” whispered the girl, when</p><p>the waiter left them. “One may be brave, </p><p>yes, but the Bull has many to kill for him.” </p><p>“We’ll sit here,” said McCune stubborn- </p><p>ly, “and finish our drink. I don’t propose </p><p>to be stampeded.” </p><p> “No,” said Vesta, “but my Americano is</p><p>in danger. I feel it! Let us go now before </p><p>it is too late.” </p><p> McCune refused, and finished his wine.</p><p>The restaurant became suddenly strangely </p><p>silent. The girl clutched his arm. </p><p> “They are coming!” she breathed, and</p><p>McCune pushed her behind him as he rose </p><p>and faced the door, pistol ready. </p><p>68 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Clay McCune knew well the man who</p><p>stood in the entrance. He was small of </p><p>stature, but thick and muscular. His wide, </p><p>evil face, with its sparse-haired drooping </p><p>mustache and spreading pockmarked nose, </p><p>was lighted by shrewd, cruel eyes, which </p><p>missed no detail of the situation. He </p><p>bowed low as he came through the door, </p><p>and his hands came forward innocently. </p><p>McCune’s heavy automatic covered him </p><p>steadily, and it was to this that he gave </p><p>obeisance, rather than to the man or the </p><p>girl, for this was Hippole Ferez’s prize </p><p>killer and assassin, Gutierrez the Butcher. </p><p> McCune motioned with his free hand to</p><p>the table before him. </p><p> “Your gun!” he ordered crisply, and</p><p>Gutierrez laid it down obediently. </p><p> He knew that the sailor could shoot, and</p><p>besides, he had other plans. </p><p> “May I sit down, senor?” he asked, as</p><p>McCune took up the extra revolver. </p><p> “What do I care?” answered McCune</p><p>contemptuously. “You might tell my friend </p><p>Ferez to come himself next time.” </p><p> Gutierrez sat down at a table in the cor-</p><p>ner. McCune and the girl started toward </p><p>the door. The sailor kept one of the re- </p><p>volvers pointed at the killer, and divided </p><p>his attention between him and the entrance. </p><p>The comer where Gutierrez sat was dark. </p><p>He pressed with his foot a small knob on the </p><p>floor. A bell whirred in the restaurant. </p><p>McCune stopped. He knew what the bell </p><p>meant. The Butcher’s helpers were wait- </p><p>ing. From behind tables, from the bar, </p><p>from the gallery upstairs, they would snipe </p><p>at him, and get him, as he went out. Vesta </p><p>gave a little stifled cry of fear. She too, </p><p>knew what the bell meant. </p><p> “Come here,” ordered McCune, menacing</p><p>Gutierrez with both revolvers. “You go </p><p>out with me. With one of these poked in </p><p>your ribs, at the first shot you get yours. </p><p>Sabe?” </p><p> “And you, Vesta,” continued McCune,</p><p>“you stay here safely. I’ll come again.”</p><p> He bent forward to kiss her, and this was</p><p>the chance that the butcher had waited for </p><p>•—a slimmer chance for himself than he </p><p>wanted, but since the failure of the other, </p><p>the only one left, and as he got to his feet </p><p>with well-feigned clumsiness, he suddenly </p><p>lifted the lightest table and flung it at </p><p>McCune, dodging to the floor with the </p><p>same movement. </p><p> The dancing girl was quicker than</p><p>McCune, and leaped forward to shield him. </p><p>The table edge struck her forehead. She </p><p>sank to the floor with the table on top of her, </p><p>as McCune began firing, first at Gutierrez, </p><p>laying him low with the second shot and </p><p>then at the others charging through the </p><p>doorway to the attack. </p><p> Behind another table in a corner, McCum</p><p>fought tiiem off, cornered, desperate, shor; </p><p>of ammunition, but his soul filled with t :&lt; </p><p>wild ecstatic glory of battle. He had be&gt; . </p><p>wounded twice. </p><p> “This’ll be the finish,” he muttered</p><p>“Old Dictionary Dick was right.” </p><p> Then, filling the doorway, unarmed, but</p><p>battle-lights playing in his eyes, came Dick </p><p>Reasoner. </p><p> “I came to arrest this man,” he shouted</p><p>in Spanish, and so far the bluff and his </p><p>positiveness had carried him safely through. </p><p>Quickly he strode to the corner, helped </p><p>McCune to his feet, and with his arm about </p><p>him, started out. </p><p> Gutierrez the Butcher, had regained con-</p><p>sciousness. McCune’s bullet had only </p><p>creased his thick scalp. His little eves </p><p>glinted as he took in the situation. Then </p><p>inch by inch along the floor he moved to an </p><p>abandoned revolver. As he gripped i: </p><p>finally, McCune and Reasoner were almost </p><p>to the door, McCune leaning against the bi«r </p><p>sailor’s shoulder, limp and tottering from </p><p>loss of blood. Gutierrez aimed careful! </p><p> He had been sent to kill McCune. and ;i</p><p>he pressed the trigger, and saw the limn </p><p>form momentarily stiffen, and then relax, ii </p><p>knew he had not missed. With a grunt &lt;■: </p><p>satisfaction he turned the revolver or. </p><p>Reasoner, who had wheeled at the shot, 1</p><p>McCune’s inert body slip to the floor, an. </p><p>crouched for a spring. But Vesta, t' </p><p>dancing girl, was first. </p><p> She had seen Gutierrez shoot McCune</p><p>had tried desperately to clear herself of th&lt; </p><p>wreckage of the table in time to save him </p><p>Now as quick as the swoop of a hawk, sh </p><p>was upon Gutierrez, and drove her k'-en </p><p>jewel-handled stiletto into his heart. Thm </p><p>with a cry of anguish, she hurled the knif' </p><p>over the patio wall toward the sea, and </p><p>followed Reasoner and his burden. </p><p>ran CLAY McCUNE died before morn- </p><p>I ^1 ‘nS *n the sick bay on the Rai-'bmv </p><p>I m’ii with Vesta, the dancing girl, sitting </p><p>beside him, her slim hand smoothing his </p><p>forehead. The captain had given her </p><p>Skirts and Brats </p><p>69 </p><p>haven and promised her safe passage to her </p><p>home in another republic. </p><p> “I am content, senor,” she told Dick</p><p>Reasoner. “I could never have held him. </p><p>He was good, so good, but wild. And I was </p><p>true to him, senor. I have flirted. I have </p><p>danced, I have been gay, but to him only </p><p>was I wife.” </p><p> “Wife!”</p><p> “Si, senor. During the first week I took</p><p>my Americano to the priest. He laugh. </p><p>‘Sure,’ he say, ‘anything goes.’ And it was </p><p>so.” </p><p> And then, with that naivete so startling</p><p>in the Latin, she told Reasoner something </p><p>else, which caused Reasoner to swallow </p><p>a couple of times, turn red, and then </p><p>ask: </p><p> “What’re you going to do? You can’t</p><p>keep on at this dancing. Have you any </p><p>money?” </p><p> She smiled at him.</p><p> “The good captain takes me to my people.</p><p>It is enough. They are rich, and I tell mv </p><p>father all.” </p><p> Reasoner breathed a sigh of relief. What</p><p>to do with Vesta had worried him, and for </p><p>once the dictionary had seemed to fail him. </p><p>As soon as he could, he excused himself, and </p><p>went back to it to apologize. Slim Higgins </p><p>joined him. </p><p> “Tell me, Dick? How’d you come to go</p><p>ashore after McCune?” </p><p> Reasoner shifted his finger from “Hy-</p><p>men,” which had stared at him blankly be- </p><p>fore when he opened the book at random in </p><p>his dilemma, and turned to another. With </p><p>a broad, calloused finger he pointed to it. </p><p> “Loyalty, Slim. See what it means—</p><p>faith, allegiance, support. I’d been preach- </p><p>ing that to Clay McCune, morning, noon </p><p>and night, and then falling down on it my- </p><p>self, in my dealings with him. I got to</p><p>thinking about it, and I went after him. </p><p>But not soon enough, Slim,” he finished </p><p>sadly. “Not soon enough.” </p><p>By Louise F^icg </p><p>T HAD been arranged beforehand </p><p>that “Smoke” Mike and </p><p>“Larry the Dip” were to watch, </p><p>at a discreet distance, for the ar- </p><p>rival of “Red Jumbo,” so that, if he failed to </p><p>escape detection and detention, the rest of the </p><p>gang might be notified of the fact at once. </p><p> Being inconspicuous criminals, so far un-</p><p>mugged by the police, they waited on the </p><p>Norfolk wharf for the docking of the boat </p><p>from New York; two units of the lounging, </p><p>nondescript crowd of men and boys which </p><p>that event always attracted. They knew </p><p>that Red had been lying up, over McGurk’s </p><p>saloon, on West Third Street, long enough </p><p>to grow a disguising beard; and as he had </p><p>been in prison for three years previous to </p><p>that, during which period none of the gang </p><p>had seen him, they were prepared for some </p><p>changc in his appearance. </p><p>But although they kept their profession- </p><p>ally keen eyes on the gangplank, he was </p><p>70 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>almost abreast of them, and had sent the </p><p>fleetest of M'inks in their direction before </p><p>they recognized him, for he was most effec- </p><p>tually disguised. He carried a baby girl, </p><p>who held him tightly around the neck; to </p><p>his right hand clung a second child, an exact </p><p>duplicate of the first; and a frail, quiet- </p><p>looking woman in faded mourning walked </p><p>beside him. If Mike and Larry had beheld </p><p>their pal calmly disembarking, accompanied </p><p>by a baby elephan t and six blue monkeys they </p><p>could not have been more flabbergasted. </p><p> For once in their hves, they forgot to look</p><p>furtively about for possible unfriendly min- </p><p>ions of the law. Openly staring, they fol- </p><p>lowed Red and his amazing entourage to the </p><p>street car which would take them out to </p><p>Ocean View, a sort of cheap Coney Island, </p><p>where the gang had its headquarters over </p><p>the saloon of McGurk, brother to their </p><p>metropolitan ally. </p><p> Obeying Red Jumbo’s one backward</p><p>glance, they sank into rear seats, while he </p><p>settled the woman and the children in the </p><p>forward end of the car. Only when he had </p><p>done so did he glance around, ostentatiously </p><p>discover them, and wave them a greeting. </p><p> “Here’s two of my frien’s, now,” he ‘old</p><p>the woman, rising. “I’ll tell ’m you’re </p><p>cornin’ out.” </p><p> “You are very kind, Mr. Gleason she</p><p>replied, “to take all this trou—here, Beulah </p><p>—no, no, you must not bother our friend.” </p><p> One of the children had slid from he&gt;- -at</p><p>and taken a tight hold of Jumbo’s hand. </p><p> “Boolah go wiz ’oo,” she stated, firmly.</p><p> One of Red Jumbo’s famous scowls began</p><p>to etch itself on his face, but before it ould </p><p>gather a definite outline something inside of </p><p>him suddenly let out a chuckle. </p><p> “Aw, nev’ mind,” he said to the mother,</p><p>and walked down the aisle with the !: lie </p><p>girl. </p><p> “Hello!” he greeted his gaping pals.</p><p>“Meet m’ frien’, Miss Beulah Lawton. </p><p>Shake hands, Beulah, wit’ Mister Donovan</p><p>an’ Mister Carter.” </p><p> Thus addressed by their own proper</p><p>names, which were such conversational </p><p>rarities that for a second they failed to </p><p>identify themselves, both looked helplessly </p><p>from the dainty little child to the grinning </p><p>Jumbo, towering over them to his full sue </p><p>feet, two. They nodded, and he sat down, </p><p>facing them. </p><p> “What the’—” Smoke Mike began, and</p><p>paused, bereft of speech. </p><p> Larry the Dip, whose correct speech and</p><p>thin-lipped, narrow face told of a different </p><p>birth from the otln r two, put out his small </p><p>white hand to t ■;■ baby, who surveyed it </p><p>thoughtfully, shook hands, and smiled. </p><p>Then she hoisicd herself into Jumbo’s arms, </p><p>where she snuggled comfortably. </p><p> “This ain'l no glad hand I’m gettin’,</p><p>seems t’ me Red remarked, and laughed. </p><p> “Oh, spi: . ,-piil it!” urged Smoke Mike,</p><p>jogging an . • n&lt; ated foot. “W’atinell’s </p><p>all this, an . vav, Red? Whatcha doin’ </p><p>wit’ skoitsan’ brats?” </p><p> “ ’S all right. Smoke. I ain’t as nutty’s I</p><p>look. Here’s th’ dope, straight. Th’ dick </p><p>on th’ boat almost got wise t’ me, las’ </p><p>night. I stalled ’im by playin’ up them. </p><p>They—” he looked down at the child’s </p><p>curls and choked over the absurd statement </p><p>—“they kinda took t’ me. Yeah—’n you </p><p>can laugh, like th’ boneheads you are, but </p><p>that fixed ’im. lie knows, same as all th’ </p><p>bulls, that 1 never run with dolls, so he </p><p>played me for some hick, an’ went t’ bed. </p><p>An’ ‘01 Sqm ■, was on hand, this mornin’. </p><p>He mighta tipped me, maybe, but not the </p><p>way I was. See?” </p><p> The two ho listened nodded gravely.</p><p>Old Squee/t itherwise the head of the </p><p>Norfolk plfun-clothes men, is a terror to the </p><p>underworld. </p><p> “But whatcha bringin’ em along fer?”</p><p>Smoke d&lt; : </p><p> Red glance;! dow-/ cautiously at the child,</p><p>who had bqgun to doze. </p><p> “I’ll tell you ” lie id impressive! , "an’</p><p>you w.-n i have :io comeback. In them</p><p>cold rags dx-'s »&gt; ’ all three looked to- </p><p>ward tl. &lt; ;nan , the plain black—the </p><p>“cold iv. of Red’s speech—“there’s— </p><p>five—t’ousand — papers. Yeah! She’s </p><p>goin’ t’ put it inta a chicken farm, some- </p><p>wheres around here. Usta live down this </p><p>way. Chickens—huh? I told ’er I was </p><p>goin’ t’ visit frien’s an’ she could stop wit </p><p>’em till she got settled. An’ there ain’t no </p><p>one in th’ woild knows much about ’er, or </p><p>will look fer ’er. See? It’s easy!” </p><p> “Aw, is it?” Smoke objected. “Whatcha</p><p>goin’ t’ do? I t’ought yuh was nix on th’ </p><p>rough stuff.” </p><p> “Who’s talkin’ about it?”</p><p> “We have only today left before the job,</p><p>Red,” Larry remarked, in his smooth, </p><p>cultured voice. “We shall have to clear </p><p>tonight. All but Maggie. We framed her </p><p>to stay and give the stall.” </p><p>Skirts and Brats </p><p>71 </p><p> “That’s all right,” Red Jumbo assured</p><p>him. “That’s fixed. It’s like this.” </p><p> Finger by finger, he began checking off</p><p>the plan. </p><p> “When we get to the View, I’ll take ’em to</p><p>some eats. I kept ’em away from it on th’ </p><p>boat on poipose. You an’ Smoke let th’ </p><p>bunch know. Chase Tim an’ ‘Doc’ and </p><p>‘Spuds,’ foist. Then smooth th’shack. I </p><p>told ’er m’ frien’s was kinda rough, so she </p><p>ain’t lookin’ for no kid-glove outfit, but the </p><p>place has to look right—un’erstand? Tell </p><p>Maggie I said so. An’ she’s Mrs. Mason, </p><p>remember. All o’ you, take your own mon- </p><p>ikers. See? Put th’ pitchers an’ th’ bones </p><p>an’ all that away, an’ wise up McGurk, an’ </p><p>cut out th’ juice—un’nerstand? And tell </p><p>Maggie t’ get th’ ice off her.” </p><p> Silent, his friends followed his enumerat-</p><p>ing fingers and nodded their comprehension, </p><p>but looked their doubt. Red answered as </p><p>though they had spoken. </p><p> “Well, we don’t pull off the job till about</p><p>t’ree. Them swell hops never gets goin’ </p><p>till after midnight. T’ree’ll be right. </p><p>They’ll be dancin’ and eatin’, then. You </p><p>got the layout, all right?” </p><p> “Tim got it,” Larry replied. “He’s been</p><p>flirting with the madame’s maid. A hand- </p><p>some blighter is certainly useful in our busi- </p><p>ness, Red.” </p><p> “Yeah.” Red was used to Larry’s way</p><p>of talking. “Well, now, lookit. We’ll get </p><p>’er to bed about ’leven, anyway. An’ we’ll </p><p>have cawfee or somethin’ fer her t’ drink, </p><p>an’ sleep ’er—ten hours?” </p><p> He looked at Larry, the official knock-out</p><p>man of the gang, and a real expert in his </p><p>line. </p><p> “I can sleep her for just as long or as short</p><p>as you say, Red,” he stated, with the sure- </p><p>ness of genius in its knowledge. </p><p> “Yeah—I know. A’right. How about</p><p>you, Smoke? Got somethin’?” </p><p> Smoke, machinist, chauffeur, safe-blower</p><p>and counterfeiter, the oldest and most expe- </p><p>rienced all-around man in the gang, but not </p><p>brainy enough for a leader, smiled with </p><p>satisfaction. </p><p> “I gotta bird of a car fer th’ getaway,” he</p><p>said. “When I get ’er out a ways an’ fix ’er </p><p>up, th’ bulls’ll never spot ’er. She’s stored </p><p>in a barn back o’ the View. Owner’s in </p><p>Noo York. She won’t be looked fer fer a </p><p>while. Th’ hick that owns th’ barn don’t </p><p>use it.” </p><p> “A’right. Well, we’ll sleep th’ skoit, an’</p><p>take th’ money. Then we’ll load ’er in th’ </p><p>car when we start, an’ th’ kids wit’ ’er. </p><p>They never squeel if I’m along. They—” </p><p>For the briefest of moments something </p><p>clouded his reddish-brown eyes, which </p><p>matched and complemented his fiery thatch. </p><p>Smoke Mike did not notice it, but Larry did. </p><p> “So that’s a’right,” Jumbo went on,</p><p>quickly. “You gonna wait fer me back o’ </p><p>th’ greenhouse? Yeah—I won’t be long. </p><p>That safe’s one o’ th’ kind I’m usta. Along </p><p>toward mornin’ we’ll spill ’er an’ th’ kids </p><p>out, an’ when she wakes up, she won’t know </p><p>how she got there. Maggie’ll be gone by </p><p>then from th’ shack, an’ th’ bulls’ll be up a </p><p>tree. Besides, it’ll take ’er a while t’ get </p><p>back. It’ll have t’ be near a house, though. </p><p>They gotta have somethin’ t’ eat-” </p><p> He frowned and looked uneasily at the</p><p>sleeping child. </p><p> “I don’t like this gag, Red,” Smoke said,</p><p>following the glance. “I’m leary of it.” </p><p>Red Jumbo threw up his head and nar- </p><p>rowed his eyes. </p><p> “We’ll go t’rough wit’ it th’ way I say,” he</p><p>returned. The finality of his tone, and the </p><p>domineering look he bent on his two com- </p><p>panions explained why he had kept the </p><p>leadership of the gang through his absence </p><p>from them. “That five t’ousand’ll keep us </p><p>for a mont’. We won’t have t’ give up to </p><p>oP Isaacstein till th’ papers stop yellin’ an’ </p><p>that’s when th’ bulls’ll stop huntin’, much, </p><p>an’ we’ll get more’n double if we wait.” </p><p>SMOKE AND LARRY nodded, </p><p>thoughtfully. The funds of the </p><p>gang were far lower than they</p><p>should have been, in view of the big job they </p><p>had on hand—the looting of a famous coun- </p><p>try house near Norfolk, where a ball was to </p><p>be held, that night. If they were forced to </p><p>dispose of the booty to the “fence” who was </p><p>usually allied with them, but who squeezed </p><p>them of every possible cent, while the hue </p><p>and cry was still in full force, they would be </p><p>robbed, as usual. </p><p> But if they could scatter, each with</p><p>enough money to live on for a month or so— </p><p>yes, Red was right. It was worth added </p><p>trouble and risk, that five thousand dollars. </p><p>As they thought of it, their faces brightened. </p><p>This was what it was to have the right kind </p><p>of a leader. During Red’s absence their </p><p>pickings had been very meager. </p><p> Red Jumbo, used to watching faces, knew</p><p>what their decision was before they gave </p><p>72 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>him the curt nods which settled it. With- </p><p>out another word he rose, carrying the </p><p>sleeping child, and went forward to the </p><p>woman who welcomed him with a very </p><p>pleasant smile. </p><p> Blonde Maggie won the admiration of</p><p>both men by her instant comprehension of </p><p>what was wanted. </p><p> “Leave it to me,” she commanded, before</p><p>they were half through, “we only got a few </p><p>minutes.” and thereafter she drove them </p><p>with an energy which left them breathless. </p><p> They finished just as Red came along the</p><p>boardwalk. Maggie and Larry hastily </p><p>checked over each detail, while Smoke </p><p>watched from a window to signal a nearer </p><p>approach of the visitors; cards and dice, </p><p>paper-backed novels, pictures from The </p><p>Police Gazette tacked on the walls, dirt </p><p>from the corners, glasses and many bottles </p><p>from the sideboard, Maggie’s red silk waist </p><p>from her back—all, all were gone. </p><p> Maggie, denuded of some of her yellow</p><p>hair, and of most of her paint, and with all </p><p>the ice stripped from her fingers and ears, </p><p>looked so different that Larry had stopped, </p><p>several times, to look at her with astonish- </p><p>ment. </p><p> “Remember, now, Smoke,” she said, im-</p><p>pressively, “I’m Mrs. Mason, and you’re </p><p>my brother, Mike Donovan. You work on </p><p>the roller-coasters, in the season, and I run </p><p>a peanut-stand. You, Larry—what are </p><p>you?” </p><p> A smile, sophisticated, sad and grim,</p><p>flitted over Larry’s mobile lips. </p><p> “I am just what I was when you knew me</p><p>first,” he replied, “a young fellow from one </p><p>of the F. F. V.’s who had taken to coke and </p><p>inferior society.” </p><p> Maggie was not sensitive, as a rule, but</p><p>some color which had not come in a box </p><p>stained her cheek at Larry’s remark. He </p><p>noticed it, but before he could utter the </p><p>punctilious apology which his early training </p><p>brought to his lips, Red, the woman and the </p><p>children were in the room.</p><p> Larry and Maggie, together, saved the</p><p>first half-hour from being one of extreme </p><p>constraint, for Smoke, afraid of saying </p><p>something out of character, contented him- </p><p>self with mumbling, and Jumbo, into whose </p><p>lap both the children had promptly crawled, </p><p>was acutely and most uncomfortably self- </p><p>conscious, despite the fact that the situation </p><p>was of his own bringing about. </p><p> What he had not counted on was the</p><p>effect it had upon himself, nor the queer at- </p><p>mosphere it had brought upon the rooms </p><p>which usually echoed to profanity and </p><p>smelled of tobacco and whisky. He kept </p><p>remembering the last time he had been </p><p>there, just before he was “nabbed.” There </p><p>had been a fight, that night. </p><p> And now, here were all sorts of things,</p><p>changed by a woman and two babies. </p><p>There was Maggie, without the inevitable </p><p>cigaret, without the flash of diamonds— </p><p>Maggie in a white waist and an oddly sub- </p><p>dued manner. There was Larry, talking </p><p>the way Larry could, but seldom did; there </p><p>was Smoke, silent, with clean hands; there </p><p>was McGurk, sneaking up the back stairs to </p><p>look at the new arrival, and remaining to </p><p>stare, open-mouthed, at Jumbo, until a </p><p>scowl sent him scurrying below, but not </p><p>without the upward flung echo of a laugh. </p><p>And, most of all, there was the amazing, the </p><p>disconcerting, the incredible sensation ot </p><p>two warm little bodies, snuggled against </p><p>him, and the fragrance of their dainty little </p><p>selves in his nostrils. </p><p> It got on toward noon. Usually, McGurk</p><p>sent up a lunch from the saloon below </p><p>to as many of the gang as might be on </p><p>hand. What should be done under these </p><p>circumstances? Red Jumbo, gradually get- </p><p>ting over his state—or, rather, getting used </p><p>to it—raised his eyebrows at Maggie, but it </p><p>was the mother of the twins who answered </p><p>the question which they were all asking </p><p>themselves. </p><p> “I’ve been smelling your dinner for some</p><p>time, Mrs. Mason,” she said, “and I know </p><p>you want to go and look after it. You’ll </p><p>let me help, won’t you?” </p><p> For a moment, Maggie looked helplessly</p><p>at Red. The meal was cooking in the kit-</p><p>chen of the saloon. Then her woman’s in- </p><p>ventiveness came to her aid. </p><p> “Why, the truth is, that ain’t my dinner,”</p><p>she acknowledged. “I’ve been over to my </p><p>sister’s in Norfolk all week, an’ I just got </p><p>home before you and R— and Mr. Gleason </p><p>arrived. I ain’t got a thing in the house, </p><p>I’m sorry to say, but I thought, soon as you </p><p>was feeling at home, I’d go out and-” </p><p> Little Mrs. Lawton, with a gay smile, and</p><p>a child-like clap of her hands, interrupted </p><p>her. </p><p> “Let me! Let me!” she cried. “I’ve</p><p>been living in a boarding-house for two </p><p>years, ever since my husband died, and I’m </p><p>just homesick for a cook-stove! I want to </p><p>Skirts and Brats </p><p>73 </p><p>buy everything, and cook it. Don’t say I </p><p>can’t!” </p><p> They couldn’t do anything with her.</p><p>She swept everything before her with en- </p><p>thusiasm, with good comradeship. She </p><p>found a basket big and strong, in which </p><p>McGurk usually sent up bottles; she in- </p><p>sisted that Maggie tell her what was lack- </p><p>ing in the larder; she tied a towel around </p><p>Smoke’s waist and set him to peeling pota- </p><p>toes against her return; and before they </p><p>knew how she had done it she had carried </p><p>off J umbo, bearing the basket and a sheepish </p><p>expression, on shopping intent. </p><p> “I dunno w’atinell’s struck Red,” Smoke</p><p>complained, as he went at his task, “this </p><p>skoit’s actin’ ’s though she owned him. I </p><p>hope she’s got the wad Red says she </p><p>has.” </p><p> Maggie did not answer. She was laying</p><p>the table with linen and silver, hastily re- </p><p>quisitioned from McGurk, remembering </p><p>some old forms which had not occurred to </p><p>her for many a day. Larry went down to </p><p>the corner, where there was a cheap florist </p><p>and brought back a big bunch of the small, </p><p>yellow roses which are Virginia’s most dis- </p><p>tinctive flower. </p><p> Maggie sniffed the spicy odor thought-</p><p>fully. </p><p> “We usta have a big bush of these,” she</p><p>said, to nobody in particular. Larry turned </p><p>quickly and looked out of the window. He </p><p>did not want his face to be seen just then. </p><p>There had been a long row of those big </p><p>bushes before a big, pillared house where his </p><p>memory sometimes strayed. </p><p> Beulah and Lulu, confided to Maggie’s</p><p>care by their mother, trotted after the girl, </p><p>asking questions, getting in her way, and </p><p>sometimes imperiously demanding to be </p><p>kissed. Once, without their asking, Maggie </p><p>stooped and gathered them fiercely into </p><p>her arms, but they were not frightened. </p><p>They hugged back with their strong little </p><p>arms, and kissed her tenderly, when they </p><p>saw tears in her eyes. </p><p> Mrs. Lawton brought back a basket filled</p><p>to the brim, and a strangely silent man. </p><p>But she, herself, bubbled over with good </p><p>spirits. She praised Smoke’s pile of pota- </p><p>toes, she put the chickens she had brought </p><p>on to roast, she set Larry to shelling peas, </p><p>she asked Maggie for her “favorite recipe,” </p><p>she declared nothing in the world had ever </p><p>looked as good to her as those Virginia roses; </p><p>and, that the culinary operations might be </p><p>unhampered, she put the twins into Jumbo’s </p><p>capacious arms for safe-keeping. </p><p> Somewhere Maggie had unearthed two</p><p>aprons; somehow, straightening the window </p><p>shades and setting chairs and bureaus to </p><p>rights, Maggie had contrived to give the </p><p>place such a domestic look that Red felt </p><p>himself actually abashed before it. He and </p><p>Larry and Smoke sat together, smelling </p><p>homelike odors and listening to the bits of </p><p>conversation which drifted out of the kit- </p><p>chen. How Beulah had had the measles </p><p>last year, and did Maggie think the largest </p><p>chicken was browning too fast, and were </p><p>there good dry-goods stores in Norfolk now, </p><p>and where was the potato-masher? </p><p> Casual, unimportant woman-talk, all</p><p>that, but very, very strange to the ears of </p><p>two of the men who listened. To Larry, it </p><p>was not strange, but it was dreadful. </p><p>To Smoke, it was queer, but umneaning. </p><p>To Jumbo, who had never heard its like be- </p><p>fore, it was a part of the confusion which </p><p>was slowly taking its grip upon his soul. </p><p> THE dinner was an unqualified suc-</p><p>cess, even to Smoke, who surveyed </p><p>the glass of water beside his plate </p><p>with extreme distaste. But before he </p><p>could say anything the twins, solemnly </p><p>folding their fat hands, bowed their heads </p><p>and murmured: </p><p> “For yis meal, God make us tooly sank-</p><p>ful. Amen!” </p><p> Maggie and Larry and Red, who had</p><p>hastily ducked their heads, in accord with </p><p>Mrs. Lawton’s, were crimson at the con- </p><p>clusion of the little ceremony; especially as </p><p>they met the sardonic grin of Smoke who </p><p>had chosen to fill in time by eating the cole- </p><p>slaw at his plate. </p><p> They fingered over the meal, strangely</p><p>loath to break up the association of the</p><p>table. It was fairly quiet. The season </p><p>had not really opened, yet, and most of the </p><p>“attractions” at the beach were still closed. </p><p>The late afternoon sun came slithering in </p><p>while they still sat on. Beulah and Lulu, </p><p>despite their mother’s remonstrance, had </p><p>returned to Jumbo’s lap. </p><p> “I haven’t felt so happy since poor Tom</p><p>was taken from me,” Mrs. Lawton said. </p><p> She pushed back her chair, humming a</p><p>tune. She broke off a rose and pushed it </p><p>through her heavy dark hair. There was a </p><p>beautiful, faint color in her cheeks and </p><p>her eyes were sweet and deep. She had </p><p>74 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>probably never been beautiful, but she was </p><p>something more compelling than that; she </p><p>shone with a sort of glory. Red Jumbo </p><p>looked at her so steadily that she blushed </p><p>a little. Then, swiftly, she turned around </p><p>to the piano, and broke out into a clear </p><p>haunting contralto. </p><p> She sang “Absent,” and “Juanita,” and</p><p>“Old Black Joe,” “The Harbor Bar” and </p><p>“Rocked In The Cradle of The Deep.” </p><p>Every time that she stopped and swung </p><p>around they begged her to go on. They </p><p>leaned forward in their chairs, as the twi- </p><p>light settled on them, and gave themselves </p><p>up to her, and she took their hearts with </p><p>her, far, far from anything they had ever </p><p>known. Then, when it was too dark to see, </p><p>she began something, and the two children, </p><p>stirring, piped up with her- </p><p> “Jesus loves me, this I know, for the</p><p>Bible tells me so.” </p><p> Smoke snorted and tramped down-stairs,</p><p>but Maggie and Larry and Jumbo, shadows </p><p>in their chairs, did not move, and Mrs. </p><p>Lawton, when that song was done, began </p><p>“Nearer my God to Thee.” </p><p> She got up after she had finished that.</p><p> “I reckon that will be good night for the</p><p>babies,” she remarked, casually. “And </p><p>you folks must be tired of listening to me.” </p><p>She moved toward the door, but Beulah </p><p>and Lulu objected. They wanted to be </p><p>kissed “dood night;” they wanted to hug </p><p>Jumbo; they wanted “Mis’er Lawy” to goas </p><p>far as the hall; they wanted “Aunt Maggie” </p><p>to promise to tuck them in. </p><p> “I’m afraid my little girls are too wilful,”</p><p>the mother said, over her shoulder, as she </p><p>finally led them away. “I’ve spoiled them, </p><p>maybe.” </p><p> They could hear her singing, in Maggie’s</p><p>room, as she undressed the babies. After a </p><p>while Maggie lit the gas. </p><p> Smoke came up the stairs, treading</p><p>lightly. </p><p> “Jes’ bin out t’ look around,” he whis-</p><p>pered. “Doc an’ Tim’s come in. Say, </p><p>ain’t dis skoit de limit?” </p><p> No one replied. He looked from one</p><p>face to the other, puzzled. </p><p> “Say, what’s eatin’ youse? Yuh look</p><p>like a bunch o’ rummies.” </p><p> Still no one spoke. Then Jumbo lifted</p><p>his head, and licked his dry lips several </p><p>times; swallowed and stood up. </p><p> “You—you keep yore tongue off’n ’erl”</p><p>he said huskily. </p><p> “Aw, is that so?” Smoke sneered.</p><p>“Whadcha do? Fall fer de skoit?” </p><p> Jumbo’s blazing eyes menaced him.</p><p> “Shut up!” he ordered, with a warning</p><p>glance toward the bedroom. </p><p> Mrs. Lawton was still singing a little.</p><p> Smoke’s mean little eyes narrowed.</p><p> “S-a-a-y,” he drawled, “w’at’s degag?”</p><p> Jumbo opened and shut his big hands.</p><p> “I started this, an’ I’m goin’ t’rough wit’</p><p>it my way. See? I—she—I dunno how </p><p>it’s goin’ t’ lay—but I ain’t goin’ t’ have </p><p>any—I ain’t goin’t’ take ’er wad, an’ that </p><p>goes. See?” </p><p> “An’ I s’pose de rest is in on dis?” Smoke</p><p>demanded. </p><p> Jumbo looked at the other two. Larry</p><p>nodded, his lips set in a thin, hard line. </p><p>Maggie whimpered. </p><p> “I ain’t had a kid around for years,” she</p><p>said. </p><p> Jumbo brought his eyes back to Smoke.</p><p> “Yeah—” he said, and in his excitement</p><p>forgot to keep his voice lowered. “An’ </p><p>w’at’s more, I ain’t goin t’rough wit’ </p><p>t’night, either. I’m—I ain’t goin’ to. That’s </p><p>all.” </p><p> There was a slight, a very slight move-</p><p>ment of Smoke’s right hand and something </p><p>shining lay in it. </p><p> “I t’ought yuh was failin’ fer de skoit,” he</p><p>growled. “I seen yuh. Yah! Yuh make </p><p>me sick! Yuh better change yore mind, </p><p>quick, ’r yuh won’t have none left t’change, </p><p>for I’ll drill yore bean. Yuh can’t put dis </p><p>over. D’yuh t’ink de rest o’ de gang’s goin’ </p><p>t’ lose out jes’ fer a skoit an’ brats? Take it </p><p>from me, yuh’l go t’rough wit’ it, ’r I’ll drill </p><p>yuh, ’n yuh needn’t be lookin’ like—I got </p><p>de drop on yuh, an’-” </p><p> “And I have the drop on you, Smoke,”</p><p>said a very quiet voice from the doorway. </p><p>“Move your hand an inch and I’ll shoot it </p><p>off.” </p><p> Like automatons, they wheeled; their</p><p>jaws simultaneously fell open. Mrs. Law- </p><p>ton was in the room, with a large, business- </p><p>like revolver in what each one of them saw </p><p>was a practised hand. </p><p> “What th’—” Smoke began, and lowered</p><p>his weapon. </p><p> He was an indifferent shot. Only the</p><p>fact that he was sure Red Jumbo was un- </p><p>armed had allowed him to call the turn on </p><p>him. But he knew that this woman could </p><p>and would do what she said, though how and </p><p>why. . . . </p><p>“Going West” </p><p>75 </p><p> “Put it on the floor,” she ordered.</p><p> He did it. She motioned that he should</p><p>stand back by the stairs. Then she looked </p><p>at the others. </p><p> “They used to call me ‘Chicago Bessie,’ ”</p><p>she announced, simply. </p><p> A murmur, an indrawn breath, answered</p><p>her. Chicago Bessie! The slickest con- </p><p>fidence-woman in the business. One of the </p><p>cleverest, coolest female crooks known to </p><p>the underworld. </p><p> Jumbo took a stiff step nearer to her.</p><p> “So—you was stallin’,” he said. “You</p><p>—” he laughed. “Huh! I t’ought—some- </p><p>thin’ diff’rent.” </p><p> “No, I wasn’t stalling,” her reply was to</p><p>him, alone. “I got into bad ways when I </p><p>married Tom. I guess you people didn’t </p><p>know him. He’d have been a good man if </p><p>he hadn’t been so weak. And I was young. </p><p>But I was raised right, Jumbo. Just as I </p><p>told you, on a farm near here. I never got </p><p>sent up until two years before Tom died. </p><p>The babies were only three months old. </p><p>It nearly killed me. And when I got </p><p>out last year he was dead and they had </p><p>been boarding with a good woman. The </p><p>first night I was home, they knelt down and </p><p>said their prayers at my knees. And I </p><p>changed. That’s all.” </p><p> Her eyes were filling, filling, and a sob</p><p>which she could not control broke in her </p><p>throat. </p><p> “Whadcha come here wit’ me for?”</p><p> “I knew who you were.”</p><p> “You-”</p><p> He fell back a step, and his face darkened.</p><p>“If yore workin’ wit’ th’ bulls—” he </p><p>began. </p><p> “I knowed it! I knowed it!” Smoke</p><p>croaked, and moved, only to stop, midway </p><p>of his crouch for his weapon. </p><p> “I’ve still got the drop on you, Smoke,”</p><p>Chicago Bessie told him, “and 1 don’t have </p><p>to see to shoot straight.” </p><p> She fumbled with her left hand for her</p><p>handkerchief, and wiped away her tears. </p><p> “Fer Gawd’s sake, tell me th’ trut’!”</p><p>Jumbo implored. “I gotta know!” </p><p> “I knew you on the boat,” she said.</p><p>“You were pointed out to me, once. And </p><p>I	knew about the gang, too, and I took a</p><p>chance. I—I told you I’d changed. I’ve </p><p>tried to get hold of people that had gone </p><p>wrong— I’ve tried to do a little good. I </p><p>left my money with the purser, and I came </p><p>out here with you hoping I could do or say </p><p>something—or that God would let my little </p><p>girls soften your hearts-” </p><p> It seemed that she could not go on. And</p><p>then she dropped to her knees. </p><p> “Oh, my dear Lord!” she prayed. “I</p><p>don’t know what to say to these dear peo- </p><p>ple, but You know what I want. I want </p><p>them for You. That’s why I came. I—■ </p><p>help me. Tell me what to say!” </p><p> Cursing, Smoke turned and tramped</p><p>loudly down the stairs, slamming the street </p><p>door after him. Larry and Maggie, who </p><p>were crying, knelt down. Chicago Bessie </p><p>looked up at Jumbo. </p><p> “And you?” she asked.</p><p>“GOING WEST” </p><p> by HUGH PENDEXTER</p><p>GOING WEST,” as used by the men </p><p>overseas to mean death, is of pecu- </p><p>liarly American origin, aboriginal American </p><p>origin. The Karok Indians of California </p><p>believed the spirit of the good Karok went </p><p>to the “happy western land.” The Chero- </p><p>kee myths picture the west as the “ghost </p><p>country,” the twilight land where go the </p><p>dead. The Shawnee tell of the boy who </p><p>“traveled west” to find his sister in the </p><p>spirit land. The Chippewa believed the </p><p>spirit “followed a wide, beaten path toward </p><p>the west.” The spirit world of the Fox</p><p>Indians is at the setting of the sun. And </p><p>so on, in the theology of many Indian </p><p>Nations we find the “West” as the storied </p><p>abode of the great majority—who have </p><p>passed over. </p><p>ThQ OrQQsor </p><p> a</p><p>Gordon Young </p><p> &amp;, Jocl^Holt</p><p>HIS happened between sunset </p><p>and dawn one night, not on, </p><p>but rather close to, the Mexican </p><p>border where Jose Juarez, the </p><p>gambler, somewhat tentatively held a place </p><p>of respect for himself in the Tarantula </p><p>Dance and Gambling Hall. Jose was </p><p>quiet, unobtrusive. He had hard eyes </p><p>and nimble fingers and wore his holster </p><p>high on the left of his breast in such a way </p><p>that it was concealed by the serape always </p><p>thrown across the shoulder. </p><p> Doug Walsh, who was suspected of having</p><p>more notches on his guns—he packed two— </p><p>than graves he had filled, but who never- </p><p>theless was with good reason feared, some- </p><p>times boasted that he would shortly find </p><p>out just how quickly that greaser could </p><p>draw. But for some cause or other he, </p><p>like the cowboys that flocked around the </p><p>bar and grumbled about a Mexican treat- </p><p>ing himself as their equal, hesitated to </p><p>come to gun-play; although, Heaven knows, </p><p>there was excuse enough to pick a quarrel </p><p>since Louise Lawton often turned from one </p><p>of them to dance with him. </p><p> Louise was a queer girl: pretty of course,</p><p>or there wouldn’t have been anything </p><p>to quarrel over. But she was different </p><p>from the other girls. Perhaps not prettier, </p><p>for beauty is a matter of taste; but she </p><p>seemed to understand men better—that is, </p><p>she perhaps better understood all of them </p><p>excepting her own brother, and everybody </p><p>but her knew that he was worse than no </p><p>good, being a cheat, a coward, a liar, a kind </p><p>of sickly weakling in body and soul. </p><p> He was weak rather than evil, which is a</p><p>poor apology for a fellow who, even as he </p><p>promised his sister not to gamble was </p><p>wheedling money out of her for no other </p><p>purpose; and who pulled with Doug Walsh </p><p>—when everybody knew that Sheriff Clif- </p><p>ford was keeping suspicious eyes on that </p><p>desperado—and merely grinned nervously </p><p>at the abuse Walsh piled on to him; and </p><p>who had been caught stealing from a </p><p>drunken man’s pocket—there is no need </p><p>to recite what all else. But to Louise he</p><p>was her “brother,” and that kept him from </p><p>having his neck wrung a dozen times a </p><p>month. </p><p> And she was under the-delusion that he</p><p>was her protector! That the reason men </p><p>were more respectful to her was because </p><p>she, alone of all the girls at the Tarantula, </p><p>had a brother. </p><p> Louise was rather short, of irrepressible</p><p>vitality and vivid. Her hair was black and </p><p>her eyes blue, and she wore a short scarlet </p><p>skirt, black silk stockings, tiny slippers </p><p>with glittering brass buckles. Sometimes </p><p>her low-necked waists were of black, some- </p><p>times of yellow, silk. The men did not </p><p>paw her over, even when they had been </p><p>drinking. She knew how to evade un- </p><p>welcome caresses without giving offense. </p><p>She knew how to keep men at arm’s length </p><p>even though the very exclusion heightened </p><p>the desire for contact. As has been said, </p><p>she understood men. </p><p> She detested Doug Walsh and continued</p><p>to be friendly with Jose Juarez, though </p><p>she knew that the Mexican was intensely in </p><p>The Greaser </p><p>77 </p><p>love with her and sometimes annoyed her </p><p>with talk about marriage; but he was a </p><p>wonderful dancer, always respectful, and </p><p>had “something” about him—which was </p><p>poise, though she probably had never heard </p><p>the word—that she liked. </p><p> She suspected that Juarez was a half-</p><p>breed, but he wore the picturesque Mexican </p><p>dress; velvet trousers, sewn with silver </p><p>buttons up the side, a jacket of black velvet </p><p>trimmed with buttons and silver em- </p><p>broidery, and a white ruffled shirt. He also </p><p>wore the small, made-to-order boots and </p><p>large, decorated sombrero of the horseman </p><p>though he seldom rode, and did not own a </p><p>horse. When one stays up all night there </p><p>is little inclination for the saddle the next </p><p>day. </p><p> Louise had time and again asked Jose</p><p>not to play cards with her brother. Louise </p><p>did not know it, but Charles falsely at- </p><p>tributed all of his losses at cards to the </p><p>Mexican—though he did lose, and often </p><p>all he had, every time he played with Jose, </p><p>for the gambler knew from whence Charles </p><p>got most of his money. A queer thing, too: </p><p>Jose never seemed to have any luck if he </p><p>sat in a game where Louise chanced to be </p><p>playing—but she, she had to make a </p><p>pocketbook of her skirt to carry home the </p><p>winnines. </p><p> “Charley,” Louise said after she had</p><p>scooted off the dance-floor to evade Doug </p><p>Walsh nrl found her brother across from </p><p>the Me m at a table in an alcove, “you </p><p>proi&gt; : ‘ - you wouldn’t play again!” </p><p> “A\ . i m not playing. Just penny ante.”</p><p> Chu les was nervous. Jose had noticed</p><p>it. He had noticed too that several times </p><p>during the evening Charles and Doug Walsh </p><p>slipped into the shadows, and Jose, spying </p><p>with catlike, inscrutable eyes, surmised that </p><p>the gunman was either trying to bully </p><p>Charles into doing something, or to hold </p><p>him to a promise that had already been </p><p>forced out of him. Charles would promise </p><p>almost anybody anything. </p><p> fie himself had pulled Charles away</p><p>from the bar where Thomas, a nester with a</p><p>homestead about five miles out on the Lone </p><p>Pinon Road, was foolishly buying drinks </p><p>from a wad that represented a successful </p><p>alfalfa crop—incidentally, while Mrs. </p><p>Thomas sat with the dull patience of a </p><p>work-worn woman, nursing a few-months- </p><p>old baby, in a buckboard out in front and </p><p>waited. Jose thought it better for Charles </p><p>to be gambling mildly with him than </p><p>brewing deviltry with Doug Walsh. </p><p> Jose had two and a half crosses cut on</p><p>the handle of his gun. He had cut the </p><p>half cross one night when Louise had </p><p>slapped Doug Walsh’s face and had then </p><p>coolly stared down the bad man though </p><p>both of his guns had leaped from their </p><p>holsters. </p><p> The half of a cross had not been cut,</p><p>however, until after Jose had said ex- </p><p>pectantly to Charles— </p><p> “The son of a skunk has insulted your</p><p>sister.” </p><p> Charles had concealed his fear and agi-</p><p>tation under a pitiable attempt at uncon- </p><p>cern. </p><p> “Aw, Doug didn’t mean nothing. He’s</p><p>a good fellow. Lou is too - touchy </p><p>anyway.” </p><p> Charles had averted his face as he said it.</p><p>Jose had hard eyes to stare into. • </p><p> But one good thing about Charles: he</p><p>was not a trouble-maker, a tale-bearer. </p><p>He never told Doug what the Mexican </p><p>said, or any of the other insulting remarks </p><p>that Jose let fall. Doug would have gone </p><p>loco if he had known what Jose was saying </p><p>of him even when Louise came up. </p><p> “Well, quit right now,” she told her</p><p>brother, who had tried to fend off her </p><p>protest with the excuse of “penny ante.” </p><p>“And you tell Doug Walsh that if he isn’t </p><p>looking for trouble to keep his dirty hands </p><p>off me. You have to make him stop that </p><p>rough stuff, Charley-” </p><p> “Pardon me,” Jose interrupted softly—</p><p>his voice was ever smooth as velvet, almost</p><p>musical, “but if you will permit, I shall take </p><p>pleasure in speaking to him for you.” </p><p>“Thanks, Jose,” she answered, playfully </p><p>tossing a rose petal toward him. “I’ve </p><p>heard that before.” </p><p> “But, seiiorila,” Jose said, standing up</p><p>resolutely. </p><p> “No, no. Sit down. Charley will tell</p><p>him again. And Jose, promise me you </p><p>won’t play with Charley any more—tonight </p><p>at least. He hasn’t any money, anyway.” </p><p>“No,” Charles answered in an injured </p><p>tone, “but you have. I’d have cleaned him </p><p>tonight if I’d have had anything to bet. </p><p>Gee, I’d bet a wad big as Thomas’ on the </p><p>hand ’fore this.” </p><p> “I will promise,” Jose said to her, and</p><p>added with a smile, “that is, as long as I </p><p>know he hasn’t any money.” </p><p>78 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> When Louise walked away Charles fol-</p><p>lowed her. He was back in a few minutes </p><p>and coaxing the gambler to play. But Jose </p><p>refused. Others in plenty were playing </p><p>poker. </p><p> “She’ll spot me,” Charles lamented,</p><p>“about the second hand. Hey, you,” he </p><p>called to a cowboy, Jim of the Frying Pan </p><p>outfit, “give me that lid and coat of yours </p><p>and I’ll sit with my back to the door.” </p><p> Jim was one of those who liked Louise</p><p>very much. </p><p> “I’ll give you the coat,” he said, for the</p><p>evening was warm and he was ready to shed </p><p>the unaccustomed garment anyway. “But </p><p>not this J. B. It’s new. Get Jose’s rain </p><p>tent. It’ll hide you.” </p><p> And Jose permitted Charles to take the</p><p>sombrero, with its embroidery and silver </p><p>band worth about thirty times as much </p><p>as Jim’s new Stetson; and Charles cast his </p><p>own hat toward a corner and sitting down </p><p>with his back to the dance-hall door, began </p><p>to play. </p><p> An hour later Doug Walsh, who had</p><p>looked all over the place for him, discovered </p><p>Charles. </p><p> “Come on. We’ll have to ride like -.</p><p>Whatchu try in’ to do? Hide out from </p><p>me in that rig? Thomas’ been gone quarter </p><p>of an hour ’r more.” </p><p>II </p><p>SOME time after midnight, fifteen </p><p>or twenty minutes past, Jose cashed </p><p>in at the game he was playing and </p><p>started to go out on the dance-floor to find </p><p>Louise; and he bumped into Charles. </p><p> “Where is my som-”</p><p> He got no further. Charles pushed back</p><p>the hat—his own—that he was wearing </p><p>as he excitedly flashed a fist-full of currency </p><p>in the gambler’s face. </p><p> “Come on. You know I got some money</p><p>now. I owe you a trimmin’—’bout a dozen </p><p>of ’em.” </p><p> Jose shook his head thoughtfully.</p><p> “Don’t be a piker.”</p><p> Jose remembered the time Louise had</p><p>sold her ring, a small diamond that Sheriff </p><p>Clifford had bought for a watch charm— </p><p>not because he wanted it, either; except </p><p>that he thought Louise needed the money— </p><p>and Charles had got that money and lost </p><p>it in a game that Jose did not happen to </p><p>sit in. </p><p> “All right,” Jose said imperturbably,</p><p>“we’ll get off in a corner and have a little </p><p>stud.” </p><p> “That’s me. I want to get some action</p><p>for my money. I’ll show you where to </p><p>head in, too. Believe me.” </p><p> As they passed by the bar, looking for</p><p>an empty poker-room, Doug Walsh was </p><p>uproariously calling everybody up to have a </p><p>drink. </p><p> Jose heard him, but pretended not to,</p><p>and walked on. </p><p> He did not hear what Doug Walsh said,</p><p>for Walsh, who had been buying and drink- </p><p>ing recklessly, had seen. It took all of the </p><p>persuasion of Joe and Jim—called the </p><p>Twins of the Frying-Pan—to induce Walsh </p><p>to postpone the threats that he poured </p><p>out against the blankety-blankety-blankety- </p><p>blank greaser. Doug was in a fighting </p><p>mood and looking for trouble. </p><p> One reason was that he knew he had</p><p>almost everybody bluffed; another, that </p><p>he had plenty of money, and the man with </p><p>money, whether in the barroom or in the </p><p>Wall Street bank, seems to think it his </p><p>privilege to be insulting when in the least </p><p>crossed. But he talked so much about </p><p>what he was going to do, and how he was </p><p>going to do it, to the B. B. B. B. greaser </p><p>that he forgot what he was talking about </p><p>and continued to buy drinks. </p><p> In the meantime Jose and young Lawton</p><p>were playing stud. The gambler, who </p><p>always appeared on the verge of being </p><p>bored, and scarcely ever seemed to take</p><p>much interest in the game, sat. quietly </p><p>watching the cards fall. </p><p> He never looked more than once at the</p><p>card faced down, and then barely glimpsed </p><p>the pip, and made his bets nonchalantly as </p><p>the others fell face-upward. </p><p> Charles, who had a mania for gambling,</p><p>peeped at the hole card, as though to assure </p><p>himself that it hadn’t changed spots, every </p><p>time a new card was dealt. </p><p> Charles had, been getting some good</p><p>hands, and was betting strong—as he </p><p>always did. Once he had bluffed—or </p><p>thought he had bluffed—Jose out when </p><p>the Mexican had him beat in sight. </p><p> Jose had smiled slightly. It had been</p><p>his deal. The next time that it was Ins </p><p>deal Charles got an ace in the hole, and two </p><p>more aces fell with the third card dealt. </p><p>Jose had only a deuce and four in </p><p>sight. </p><p>The Greaser </p><p>79 </p><p> “I’ll let you down easy to coax you</p><p>along,” Charles said, shoving in a small </p><p>piece of silver. </p><p> No man would—or at least should—</p><p>stand for a heavy bet with a pair of aces </p><p>againsi him when at most he could have </p><p>nothin lore than a pair of fours with only </p><p>two ■- ards more to be drawn. </p><p> “If i remember correctly,” Jose said</p><p>softly, ‘you stole a pot for me a few minutes </p><p>ago. Now climb aboard this,” and he </p><p>pushed a few bills into the center of the </p><p>table. </p><p> Charles, as anybody would have done,</p><p>came back with a raise. Jose saw it, and </p><p>dealt. </p><p> Charles got a ten-spot, and Jose paired</p><p>the four. </p><p> “Three fours beat a pair of aces,” Jose</p><p>remarked. </p><p> Charles took another squint at the hole</p><p>card, bet, was raised, raised again, and was </p><p>met. </p><p> The last card gave Charles a three-spot;</p><p>and Jose paired the deuce in sight. </p><p> “Of all the luck!” Charles muttered,</p><p>taking another peep at his ace in the hole </p><p>and trying to appear down-hearted. </p><p> Jose bet—he not only bet, but he tapped</p><p>Charles’ pile; then flipped over the hole </p><p>card and revealed the third deuce. </p><p> “You are the luckiest gre-”</p><p> But Charles did not finish. He had</p><p>caught the glint in Jose’s eyes. </p><p> “Senor,” Jose said stiffly, “I was born</p><p>north of the Rio Grande. I am an Amer- </p><p>ican.” </p><p> Charles protested that he didn’t mean</p><p>anything, that he knew Jose was the best </p><p>fellow in ten lands, and wound up by </p><p>borrowing a few dollars from him. </p><p> As Jos'' sorted the bills he noticed one,</p><p>almost half-gone. A twenty-dollar bill </p><p>it was, that had been torn in the middle, </p><p>or nearly in the middle, but he put it in </p><p>with the rest, making a separate roll of the </p><p>bil's taken from Charles. </p><p> A :ew minutes later, a half-hour or so,</p><p>Louise declared she had never played in </p><p>such luck in her life. She too noticed the </p><p>torn bill as she took the pot from Jose; </p><p>and the others about the table marveled </p><p>that this Mexican gambler, who made a fat </p><p>living off the green-clothed tables, should </p><p>have been trimmed by a girl that always </p><p>showed it in her face when she had a good </p><p>hand. </p><p>Ill </p><p>WHEN Mrs. Thomas staggered into </p><p>the dance-hall, the babe in her arms, </p><p>and weakly told her story there was </p><p>cursing and clattering of feet, shouting </p><p>among the men and hysterical, high-voiced </p><p>horror and sympathy from the girls, and </p><p>presently the furious beat of hoofs as Sheriff </p><p>Clifford and the cowboys dashed away in </p><p>the night to the scen^ of the murder. </p><p> “Me and Bill was ridin’ along home,”</p><p>she said, the tears gushing afresh down along </p><p>the dried stains on her dusty, thin face. </p><p>“An’ he was singin’ loud ’cause he’d had a </p><p>little too much ’fore we started, an’ I was </p><p>feedin’ it again ’cause it had the colic </p><p>somethin’ awful an’ had been cryin’; and </p><p>then I heard somebody ridin’ fast an’ they </p><p>shouted to Bill to stop. I thought I heard </p><p>two hosses, but I didn’t see nobody but </p><p>one feller. Bill said ‘Go to -an’ </p><p>whipped up the hosses. Then they started </p><p>shootin’. Bill was shootin’ an’ a-drivin’ </p><p>like mad. </p><p> “All of a sudden he jest says ‘My Gawd!’</p><p>an’ throwed up both hands an’ fell off, an’ </p><p>I knowed they’d got him. I tried to get </p><p>the reins, but havin’ it 1 missed ’em, and </p><p>the hosses turned out an’ upset the wagon, </p><p>an’ I thought I was killed. But I heard </p><p>it cryin’, an’ it don’t ’pear to be hurt none, </p><p>jest scratched. Pore little thing! Its </p><p>father—I—I—found Bill—an’—then—I jest </p><p>had to git here—oh, God, what will I do?” </p><p> Louise had taken the baby. The sickly</p><p>little tired thing had cried itself into </p><p>exhaustion, and the side of its tender face </p><p>and body was red and black from the fall. </p><p>Some one brought a chair for the mother </p><p>who was weeping on the shoulder of a </p><p>kneeling girl—a girl whose shoulders were </p><p>bare, and whose lips and cheeks were </p><p>covered with paint—that held Mrs. </p><p>Thomas’ head and tried with phrases </p><p>that came strangely in her hoarse, coarse </p><p>voice to comfort the stricken woman. </p><p> In seconds rather than minutes the dance-</p><p>hall was emptied of men. Jose, the bar- </p><p>tender and Charles remained. Jose and </p><p>the bartender had no horses; and Charles </p><p>had been sent for a drink of water and </p><p>continued to hold the glass after Mrs. </p><p>Thomas had drunk from it. </p><p> At the bartender’s suggestion Mrs.</p><p>Thomas was taken into a room off the bar </p><p>where he had a cot; and all the girls crowded </p><p>8o </p><p>Adventure </p><p>in there, too, futilely and flutteringly trying </p><p>to do something, while he got a little wine </p><p>for her. </p><p> The baby began to cry, and Louise</p><p>holding it tightly and tenderly to her </p><p>breast left the room and walked up and </p><p>down the dance-floor. The dance-hall was </p><p>deserted except for Jose, who stood thought- </p><p>fully by a window staring out into the </p><p>darkness, and for Charles who sat on a </p><p>chair, still holding the glass, but with his </p><p>head bent down on to his chest. </p><p> From somewhere Doug Walsh appeared.</p><p>He had spent his last dollar some minutes </p><p>before Mrs. Thomas came with her poign- </p><p>ant story, but declaring that he knew </p><p>where he could get plenty more money, </p><p>he had gone out again and dug up a tin </p><p>can that had had buried about three hours </p><p>before. He had heard shouting and riding, </p><p>and wondered at it; he was surprised to </p><p>find the dance-hall empty, but though he </p><p>had a suspicion as to what had happened </p><p>he did not care. Nobody would suspect </p><p>him. -, no! It had been an inspiration </p><p>on his part that had made him knock off </p><p>that sombrero Charles had worn and leave </p><p>it on the road. Doug was feeling fine. </p><p> He swaggered up to Louise, pointed in</p><p>jest an accusing finger at the babe, and </p><p>asked— </p><p> “Yours, eh?”</p><p> Louise looked at him in angry amaze-</p><p>ment; it was not the insult to her—she </p><p>was a dance-hall girl—but the utter bru- </p><p>tality of jesting over a babe when the blood </p><p>of its murdered father was scarcely cold. </p><p> “Well,” Doug went on, gloating over his</p><p>humor, “any time you want another-” </p><p> “Charley!” she cried. “You hear this</p><p>dog!” </p><p> And she ran from the room.</p><p> Doug turned toward Charles and laughed</p><p>insultingly. He laughed the louder when</p><p>also he noticed Jose standing by young </p><p>Lawton. </p><p> “Going to kill him?” Jose whispered</p><p>softly, tensely. </p><p> A shudder perceptibly quivered through</p><p>Charles’ body. </p><p> “We must make her think you are a</p><p>man—anyway,” Jose said as he looked up </p><p>toward the approaching Doug. </p><p> “Yes, I heard you, you - greaser.</p><p>I’ve had about enough out of you, and </p><p>here’s where-” </p><p> As the desperado broke off, he reached</p><p>for his guns; he had gripped the handles </p><p>while Josh’s fingers were still softly tapping </p><p>the buttons of his jacket; and then in one </p><p>movement so swift as almost to elude </p><p>observation, Jose’s right hand flashed </p><p>upward toward his left shoulder as the </p><p>other hand pulled aside the serape—the </p><p>shot was fired as Doug’s guns swung clear </p><p>of their holsters. But only one shot was </p><p>fired, and Doug fell like a dropped stone </p><p>with a black hole squarely in the center of </p><p>his forehead. </p><p> “Here—you—quick,” Jose had said to</p><p>Charles, even as he had shot; and he </p><p>pressed the boy’s trembling fingers about </p><p>the big white ivory handle of the revolver, </p><p>and then leaped aside so that the scared- </p><p>faced girls that rushed in were in time </p><p>to see the revolver still smoking, even as </p><p>Charles looked down at it in a kind of dull </p><p>amazement. </p><p> But Jose, his fingers gently tapping the</p><p>bright buttons of his jacket, stood some </p><p>four feet away, his face emotionless, in- </p><p>scrutable as ever. </p><p> “Ask Louise why the boy borrowed my</p><p>gun,” Jose said to the bartender who shoved </p><p>his way past the girls. </p><p> Every one knew that Charles was un-</p><p>armed. But though they might wonder, </p><p>and they did, they could not doubt their </p><p>eyes: Charles had killed the gunman, and </p><p>in a square fight, for Doug Walsh was facing </p><p>him and had both guns out of (heir holsters.</p><p> Louise hastily gave the baby to some one</p><p>else and fell weeping in a mingling of horror </p><p>and gratification about the neck of her </p><p>bewildered brother. </p><p>IV </p><p>WHEN Sheriff Clifford followed by </p><p>an angry crowd came through the </p><p>Tarantula doorway the first object </p><p>that every one saw was the sombrero in </p><p>his hand. </p><p> Jose raised his arms above his head; it</p><p>was dangerous to hesitate or make a false </p><p>move before that mob of angry faces. </p><p> “That shows it, the coward! Admits it!</p><p>Greaser! Lynchin’s too good!” and kindred </p><p>remarks ran in whispers, undertones and </p><p>shouts through the room. </p><p> “Senores—” Jose began.</p><p> “Shut up!” the sheriff said. “I’ll do the</p><p>talkin’. This—” shaking the sombrero— </p><p>“was there. And some of the fellers say </p><p>The Greaser </p><p>81 </p><p>you had quite a wad on you tonight—bills. </p><p>We know you always draw gold from </p><p>the bank- </p><p> ‘But let me—” Jose began again.</p><p> “You can’t explain nothing,” voices,</p><p>menacing voices, called out. </p><p> At the word “bills,” Louise reached under</p><p>her skirts and removed the bulging object </p><p>just below her garter. A few people </p><p>crowded around her to see. </p><p> “Senores,” Jose said, though shouts and</p><p>jeers came at him, “I have not worn the </p><p>sombrero all evening. You remember—” </p><p>he addressed Jim of the Frying-Pan outfit— </p><p>“that I gave it to Charles and-” </p><p> Jim was an honest fellow. He believed</p><p>the greaser was guilty, but he admitted that </p><p>what he had said was true. </p><p> “I give it back,” Charles muttered</p><p>huskily. </p><p> In his hand was still the heavy, ivory-</p><p>handled revolver of Jose’s. </p><p> Right then Charles’ word was unques-</p><p>tioned, unquestionable; for it had been </p><p>rapidly spread among the returning posse </p><p>that Charles in a fair fight had killed Doug </p><p>Walsh, whose unattended body lay on a </p><p>table in one of the poker-rooms. </p><p> “An’ by all that’s holy,” shouted the</p><p>bartender, plucking a half of a twenty-dollar </p><p>bill from Louise’s hand. “Here’s the very </p><p>bill Thomas tore t’night. Lit a cigaret with </p><p>half of it, an’ tried to git me to break the </p><p>other half—this very bill! I wouldn’t </p><p>do it!” </p><p> “That settles it!” a voice cried, and the</p><p>men nodded sternly one to another. </p><p> Then some one jerked Sheriff Clifford’s</p><p>gun from his holster, and Joe of the Frying- </p><p>Pan put his own gun squarely into the </p><p>sheriff’s face, saying: </p><p> “Now, Sheriff, there ain’t no man we-all</p><p>respect more’n you, but there ain’t goin’ to</p><p>be no ‘law take its course’ in this. We’re </p><p>going to hang this greaser to a sycamore </p><p>down there’n the grove. Ain’t that right,- </p><p>boys?” </p><p> Oaths, nods, and a few “That’s rights”</p><p>given in even, solemn voices made answer; </p><p>the death sentence was thereby delivered. </p><p>It was not a mob, it was a small band </p><p>suddenly grown quiet, stern, in the awful </p><p>dignity that comes over men when they </p><p>pass death-judgment on a fellow-man. </p><p> In the hushed tenseness the impact of</p><p>all eyes was on the face of Jose, and some </p><p>hearts shamed the breasts they were in by </p><p>o </p><p>beating the quicker in a kind of vagrant </p><p>admiration for a man who could look back </p><p>at them with cold steady gaze. His face </p><p>was inscrutable; for all the fear revealed </p><p>he might have been in a game watching a </p><p>drunken man bluffing against a pat hand. </p><p> He turned his head, he spoke quietly,</p><p>and Charles—with averted face—trembled </p><p>as with ague when he heard Jose ask: </p><p> “Have you nothing to say, senor? You</p><p>know they will not listen to me.” </p><p> Charles did not answer.</p><p> Joe of the Frying-Pan took the rope that</p><p>Jim had brought him, put a loop around </p><p>Jose’s neck, drew it snug but not tight, and </p><p>without a word started out of the door. </p><p>The men gave way, and fell into line behind </p><p>the gambler who still held his hands above </p><p>his head. </p><p> “You won’t make no rumpus?” one of the</p><p>two men detailed to watch Sheriff Clifford </p><p>asked. </p><p> “I know it wouldn’t do no good,” the</p><p>sheriff acknowledged, saying {lie only thing </p><p>he would without admitting that he was </p><p>glad the law was not to be permitted to </p><p>take its course in punishing so dastardly a </p><p>crime. </p><p> And they started out.</p><p> Faintly, faintly and plaintively from the</p><p>room where it had been placed by its </p><p>mother, the insistent, protesting cry of the </p><p>baby floated into the dance-hall, and the </p><p>grim faces of silent men were turned, </p><p>listening, for a moment. Then they </p><p>tramped out. </p><p> Some of the girls—not all, for many</p><p>turned aside with tense lips and strained </p><p>eyes—hastily grabbed shawls to envelop </p><p>their heads, and followed. </p><p> “To think I used to like that greaser!”</p><p>Louise said brokenly. </p><p> In the stillness of the room where there</p><p>were only half-uttered whispers and soft </p><p>footsteps among those that remained, who </p><p>felt even then as if in the presence of the </p><p>dying, the shrill, insistent, quick, frightened </p><p>voice of the baby broke in convulsive </p><p>screams. </p><p> Charles nervously flung his hands to his</p><p>ears. </p><p> Louise turned to hurry to the poor little</p><p>thing, so insistent in its tiny rage. </p><p> “Lou?” Charles said weakly, almost</p><p>inquiringly. </p><p> “What is it, boy?”</p><p> “Nothing—now.”</p><p>82 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> She started again.</p><p> “Lou—where’d they carry Doug to?”</p><p> “I don’t know. The barkeep got some-</p><p>body to take it away. I’ve got to stop that </p><p>baby. Oh Lord, this is awful!” </p><p> Again she started, and again he called,</p><p>fearful of letting her get out of his sight. </p><p>“What is it?” she asked impatiently. </p><p>“Lou, I’ve just got to talk—I can’t— </p><p>I can’t—” and his voice went into a sob. </p><p> “Come on, boy,” she said tenderly,</p><p>putting an arm around him. “I know, </p><p>you’re all knocked out—it’s an awful night— </p><p>and it isn’t morning yet.” </p><p> They had no sooner reached the room</p><p>where Mrs. Thomas, unconscious, lay moan- </p><p>ing, than the baby, worn out, utterly ex- </p><p>hausted, fell for a moment into unresting </p><p>sleep. </p><p> “Oh God, what made it do that!”</p><p>Charles exclaimed quickly as an instant later </p><p>the baby opened its large, dark-blue eyes </p><p>and stared for countable seconds straight </p><p>at him with all the weird, majestic wisdom </p><p>of infancy in its gaze. </p><p> “Oh, Lou—oh, Lou,” he cried, catching</p><p>hold of her, “don’t let ’em hang Jose! He </p><p>didn’t do it. Lou, he didn’t! Doug made </p><p>me go with him. I didn’t want to go. </p><p>Honest to God, Lou—Doug did it!” </p><p> Louise did not say anything: she gasped</p><p>in one long horrified breath as she stared </p><p>bewildered, unbelieving, at her brother’s </p><p>distorted, fear-gripped face. </p><p> “Jose killed Doug—I didn’t do it—he</p><p>shoved the gun into my hand. He didn’t </p><p>know Doug did it—Thomas, I mean. I </p><p>didn’t want to go. I never give Jose back </p><p>his hat and Doug knocked it off out there. </p><p>Don’t let ’em hang him, Lou. You won’t, </p><p>will you, let ’em hang him?” </p><p> “But the barkeep-1—”</p><p> “He won it off me—Jose did. I don’t</p><p>know how much Doug got. He said I</p><p>hadn’t done my share. That shows I’m </p><p>innocent, Lou. Don’t you see it does? </p><p>I didn’t do nothin’ but go with him. I </p><p>didn’t even have a gun. Jose shot Doug </p><p>for what he said to you and shoved the gun </p><p>in my hand—said you must think I was a— </p><p>was a man!” </p><p> Louise gripped his shoulders with both</p><p>her hands. </p><p> “Charley—Charley!”</p><p> Her voice called his name but it was her</p><p>wide-staring eyes that implored him to </p><p>deny it, to say it was not true; but he only </p><p>slumped into a chair and sobbed as he </p><p>nodded his head to affirm all that he had </p><p>confessed. </p><p> And through it all the baby slept rest-</p><p>ively, but without crying. </p><p>V </p><p>A HORSE stood at the hitching </p><p>rack. The bridle reins trailed on </p><p>the ground, but it was tied with a </p><p>hackamore. Doug Walsh, when he tied it </p><p>there, had made one of those curious slip- </p><p>knots which, when the end is pulled straight </p><p>out, come undone with a jerk, but if the end </p><p>is pulled back through the loop and jerked </p><p>it tightens and is likely not to come untied </p><p>without time and patience. </p><p> Fumbling in the darkness Louise tightened</p><p>the knot. She tried to take off the hack- </p><p>amore from the horse’s head, but in an idle </p><p>moment Doug had spliced it so that it fitted </p><p>snugly in one piece. There was no other </p><p>horse at the rack. Charles had “bor- </p><p>rowed” one when he rode with Doug, and </p><p>they had all been ridden down to the grove </p><p>which was a mile and a little more </p><p>away. </p><p> Louise gasped and cried as she tugged at</p><p>the rope. Seconds were speeding away like </p><p>frantic runners in single file: any second </p><p>might snatch at Jose’s life and carry it on. </p><p> She ran back and into the dance-hall and</p><p>cried hysterically for some one to give her a </p><p>knife. </p><p> The girls looked helplessly one from</p><p>another, then some one mentioned the knife </p><p>behind the bar used to cut lemons. </p><p> As Louise dashed for it she met the bar-</p><p>tender coming out of one of the poker rooms. </p><p>He held a handful of bills in front of him. </p><p> “Whatchu know about this?” he called</p><p>at her. “Found ’em on the floor in there— </p><p>must’ve fell out of his-” </p><p> Louise gave a glance toward the doorway:</p><p>a dead man with a handkerchief thrown over </p><p>his face lay on the table. </p><p> She did not stay to listen or explain, but</p><p>snatched the knife and ran, leaped from the </p><p>door, cut the rope with one stroke of the </p><p>sharp steel, climbed into the saddle and rode </p><p>as though fleeing from terror. </p><p> The night was black, but she knew the</p><p>way. </p><p> As she came in sight of the grove she saw</p><p>a fire, a small fire built to light up the </p><p>“Rustlers’ Roost,” as the old limb was </p><p>With Pistol and Second Reader </p><p>83 </p><p>called where many a horse and maverick- </p><p>thief had been stretched by the neck, and </p><p>she could see the black shadows of men </p><p>moving back and forth. </p><p> She cried out, but she might as well have</p><p>tossed her voice to a gale. </p><p> Beating the sharp heels of her dancing</p><p>slippers against the flanks of the horse </p><p>and slapping him with ends of the reins, </p><p>she dashed on. Once to bring a burst of </p><p>speed she pricked him with the point of the </p><p>knife, and he gave such a bound as nearly </p><p>to unseat her. </p><p> And as she rode she saw one of the</p><p>shadows between her and the fire slowly </p><p>being raised from the ground. </p><p> It was Jose.</p><p> Again she cried. The distance was less</p><p>than before, and her voice was one shrill </p><p>shriek that rose like a banshee wail in the </p><p>still night. She had been heard. </p><p> A few moments later horse and rider</p><p>plunged through the circle about the fire, </p><p>and as a score of hands reached for her— </p><p>reached out to catch and stop her—she </p><p>rose in the stirrups and with a savage </p><p>upwardslash cut the rope, and the body </p><p>of the gambler fell heavily to the ground. </p><p> The next instant she had thrown herself</p><p>from the saddle and was pulling at the tight </p><p>noose about his neck as she flung incoherent </p><p>words at the stern, tense faces that were </p><p>closing in, angry at this interference with </p><p>their grim justice. </p><p> Her brother’s name, Doug Walsh’s name,</p><p>Jose’s name, and the name of Thomas, were </p><p>jumbled confusedly in the frantic words </p><p>she shouted; but slowly those who heard </p><p>understood, and looked from one to another, </p><p>wondering, unbelieving, awed. </p><p> Then Sheriff Clifford spoke.</p><p> “Now boys, it’s as hard for me to believe</p><p>this as it is for you. But maybe we’ve all </p><p>made a mistake. Maybe we’d better talk</p><p>it over an’ see if there was any time tonight </p><p>when this grea— I mean this fellow here </p><p>was away from the dance-hall. We all </p><p>know Louise wouldn’t accuse that brother </p><p>o’ hers unless-” </p><p> Louise cried out, her voice choking with</p><p>anguish and with that larger, inarticulate </p><p>horror that binds the throat in the presence </p><p>of one who has been greatly wronged—and </p><p>is dead! </p><p>w^isTOLan^ECOND reader </p><p>ffapsburg Liebo </p><p>Author of "The Bully of the Big Santee,” “Blood of Ike Allisons,” ctc. </p><p>T SEEMED the best thing to do. </p><p>/■ A The boy burrowed feet-fore- </p><p>l I J most into the haystack until </p><p>the top of his tousled head was </p><p>even with the outside. </p><p>Night had fallen an hour before, and he </p><p>had walked all of eighteen rough miles </p><p>barefoot that day, but he was too genuinely, </p><p>painfully hungry to go to sleep easily. So </p><p>he lay there in the haystack, defiant rather </p><p>than lonesome or sorry for himsdf, and </p><p>watched the steady white electric street- </p><p>lamps of the town in the valley just below. </p><p> They were queer lights to him. He had</p><p>84 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>seen nothing like them in the big blue </p><p>mountains that he was leaving behind him </p><p>forever. But there would be many, many </p><p>strange things in the new world that lay </p><p>ready for his conquering; he resolved that </p><p>he would not be surprised at anything he </p><p>saw. </p><p> The second reader and the pistol hurt his</p><p>side. He took them out of his dirty, striped </p><p>cotton shirt, and pushed them carefully </p><p>into the hay just above his head. Very </p><p>carefully, for the pistol was all that he had </p><p>left to remind him of his father, “Ironhead </p><p>Bill” Faley; and the worn, old second </p><p>reader had been given to him as a story- </p><p>book by the meek and long-suffering little </p><p>mother before the cataclysm—it was his </p><p>Good Book, verily, his Shannon’s Code of </p><p>Life, his history and encyclopedia of the </p><p>universe. </p><p> Then he went to sleep and dreamed of</p><p>the tailor and the king. </p><p> At the bright dawn he awoke with his</p><p>mind filled with thoughts of kings and </p><p>queens. Would there be a royal family in </p><p>tiie little lowland city down there? He </p><p>asked himself the question in all seriousness. </p><p>You see, he was only twelve years old, and </p><p>he knew the world only through hearsay </p><p>and that beloved second reader; he believed </p><p>every blessed word that was in the book, </p><p>and less than half of that which hehadlieard. </p><p> Then he took the old pistol from the hay,</p><p>looked for the twentieth time since he had </p><p>left Laurel Gap to see that it was loaded, </p><p>and slipped it inside his shirt. If there was </p><p>a king, he was ready and anxious to fight </p><p>that monarch’s enemies. </p><p> Fight? David Faley? His middle name</p><p>should have been fight. The men of his </p><p>people had fought themselves to death. </p><p>Literally, fought themselves to death. </p><p>Ironhead Bill had been the chief of the clan. </p><p>When Bill Faley and his little son were the </p><p>only Faleys left in the Laurel Gap country, </p><p>they had fled to North Carolina. Ironhead </p><p>Bill was heartbroken and sick over his wife’s </p><p>untimely passing, and no longer able to give </p><p>battle to the Wansleys, who were legion. </p><p>And in the North Carolina hills he had died.</p><p> But never for a minute were those hills</p><p>home to the boy David. He had made his </p><p>way back to Laurel Gap to find that there </p><p>he was an outcast, a pariah, simply because </p><p>he was a Faley. One old woman had </p><p>thrown him a moldy pone of cornbread, </p><p>as one throws a bone to a dog, and that was </p><p>the single expression of kindliness he had </p><p>had shown him upon his return to Laurel </p><p>Gap. </p><p> David had hurled the moldy bread into</p><p>the hag’s face, and stood her four grown </p><p>sons off with the revolver he carried; then </p><p>he had promised an early funeral to the man </p><p>who followed him, and put out for that place </p><p>of mystery that they called johnsville. </p><p>In the afternoon of that day a farmer’s </p><p>wife had given him something to eat for </p><p>splitting an armful of stovewood. </p><p> “The’ must be a king,” he told himself as</p><p>he crept out of the haystack. “The’ must </p><p>be a long and a queen. And ef the’ is, I’ll </p><p>shore see ’em afore I lay me down to sleep </p><p>ag’in.” </p><p> David Faley brushed off the wisps of hay</p><p>that clung to his ragged clothing, arranged </p><p>the pistol so that the waistband of his </p><p>trousers would hold it and the blousing of </p><p>his shirt would hide it, and put the second </p><p>reader in with it. Then he went down the </p><p>grassy slope and into the valley. He drank </p><p>from a spring brook, made a sort of break- </p><p>fast on apples and berries, and walked </p><p>toward town. </p><p> There was no sign of a castle, but he saw</p><p>many houses; houses of brick, and stone, </p><p>and wood, but no houses built of whole logs. </p><p>David went slowly down the main business </p><p>street. The signs he saw over doors and </p><p>on windows were of fascinating interest to </p><p>him; he spelled them all out, and he was </p><p>very proud of his ability to read—none of </p><p>the- Wansleys, he remembered, could </p><p>read. There were more lawyers than any- </p><p>thing else, it seemed, and he didn’t know </p><p>what a lawyer was! </p><p> He asked a passer-by.</p><p> “A lawyer?” frowned the man, a cynic,</p><p>without doubt. “A lawyer, son, is a liar.” </p><p> The man walked on. David stood look-</p><p>ing soberly at his back. </p><p> “A lawyer is a liar,” muttered the lad to</p><p>himself. “No Faley couldn’t be a lawyer </p><p>then. A Faley never told a lie.” </p><p> It had been their redeeming feature; it</p><p>had been their religion—“A Faley never </p><p>told a lie.” </p><p> Suddenly David halted before a tailor’s</p><p>sign, and his brown eyes brightened. The </p><p>door was opened invitingly, and he walked </p><p>in. A middle-aged man with a hook-nose </p><p>leaned over a showcase, looked over a pair </p><p>of brass-rimmed spectacles. </p><p> “What is it, son?”</p><p>With Pistol and Second Reader </p><p>85 </p><p> “Whar does the king live?” David asked.</p><p> “The king! Which King? Jim King,</p><p>or George King, or Hennery? Look here, </p><p>you little ragamuffin, you ain’t tryin’ to </p><p>saw me, are you? If you are, by Jupiter, </p><p>I’ll smack your jaws for you!” </p><p> The tailor walked around the showcase.</p><p>David stared, and he was a little white. </p><p>Perhaps the tailor had dyspepsia; anyway, </p><p>he was sour enough for vinegar. He caught </p><p>the Faley by the ear, and the next moment </p><p>he was looking into the one black eye of a </p><p>pistol-barrel! </p><p> “Turn it loose!” snapped David; and the</p><p>other obeyed with an alacrity that was </p><p>ludicrous. </p><p> “Police!” yelled the frightened, hook-</p><p>nosed man. </p><p> Police? What was that? David won-</p><p>dered. </p><p> And in another moment he knew. A long</p><p>arm in a blue sleeve shot over his shoulder; </p><p>the pistol was seized and wrenched from </p><p>his grip; a heavy hand caught him by the </p><p>collar of his dirty cotton shirt and dragged </p><p>him roughly to the sidewalk. David twist- </p><p>ed half-around, looked upward, and saw a </p><p>face that was leering and brutish. </p><p> The Faley struck that face with his brown</p><p>little fist, struck it as hard as he could </p><p>strike, and he had the sweet satisfaction </p><p>of seeing a crimson fluid that was not red </p><p>ink start from the policeman’s nose. </p><p>Quickly the officer pocketed Ironhead Bill </p><p>Faley’s revolver and caught the boy’s </p><p>wrists in both hands, and it hurt. David </p><p>went paler, but not a sound escaped his lips. </p><p>Nor did a tear come to his eyes; it had long </p><p>been his boast that nobody had ever been </p><p>able to make him cry. </p><p> “You’ll come wi’ me,” growled the police-</p><p>man; and he jerked the boy clear of the </p><p>sidewalk. </p><p> Then a strong, lean hand dropped on the</p><p>officer’s shoulder from behind, and he halted </p><p>as suddenly as though he had been shot.</p><p> David heard a voice saying sharply:</p><p> “If you feel that you’ve got to manhandle</p><p>somebody, Sayler, try manhandling me. </p><p>You must treat the kid white, Sayler; </p><p>understand?” </p><p>THE boy looked upward and </p><p>around. He saw a tall and lean, </p><p>keen-eyed, smooth-faced man of </p><p>about twenty-seven; a man who wore a </p><p>broad-brimmed black hat, a perfectly white </p><p>shirt and collar, a black string-tie, a black </p><p>suit of clothes, and a pair of expensive </p><p>Spanish boots. He had been riding. </p><p> “I’ll have to take him before Judge Bliss,</p><p>Lew,” Sayler said quite meekly. “He had </p><p>a gun, and he tried to shoot Tom Larkin.” </p><p> Lew Tannehill, real eastern Tennessee</p><p>aristocrat, looked down at the lad with an </p><p>amused, half-whimsical smile. David Faley </p><p>returned his gaze without a sign of flinching. </p><p> “Yes,” Tannehill agreed, “you’ll have to</p><p>do that.” </p><p> A crowd had gathered, of course, and this</p><p>crowd followed Johnsville’s chief of police </p><p>and only policeman and his youthful pris- </p><p>oner to the magistrate’s office. Tannehill </p><p>was among them. In fact, he led them. </p><p> Old Walter Bliss had been a circuit-court</p><p>judge for more years than he had toes, and </p><p>they still called him “Judge” Bliss. Now he </p><p>was an attorney, a real-estate dealer, and a </p><p>magistrate; he was big and bald, and very </p><p>near-sighted. As the crowd began to file </p><p>into his office, he adjusted his glasses and </p><p>wheeled in his desk chair. </p><p> “Well, Sayler, what’s this?”</p><p> Sayler halted the boy at the railing that</p><p>stood between him and Johnsville’s magis- </p><p>trate, surrendered the pistol that had been </p><p>the pride of Bill Faley’s heart, and told </p><p>all he knew of the “attempted assault.” </p><p>Tom Larkin bore out the policeman’s state- </p><p>ment. A sort of trial was held, and David </p><p>was asked many questions concerning him- </p><p>self. Through it all Lew Tannehill took </p><p>the juvenile prisoner’s part; he pleaded </p><p>the boy’s case with a moving eloqubnce</p><p>that seemed as natural with him as to </p><p>breathe. </p><p> Judge Bliss listened attentively to this.</p><p>It was easy to see that he had no love what- </p><p>ever for Tannehill, but he was courteous, </p><p>if cold. The bare truth of the matter was </p><p>that he hated Tannehill and was too well- </p><p>bred to show it. Walter Bliss, too, was a </p><p>real Tennessee aristocrat. </p><p> The magistrate was in a quandary. He</p><p>was unaccustomed to being called upon to </p><p>decide cases such as this. He glanced to- </p><p>ward Tannehill as though he would ask </p><p>advice; then he caught himself, changed </p><p>his glance to an icy stare and shifted it </p><p>quickly. </p><p> “I’ll vouch for the boy,” said Tannehill.</p><p>“I need a boy in my office, and I’ll give him </p><p>the place. As for the legal side of it, sir, </p><p>I think this is a thing that might be left </p><p>86 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>entirely to the discretion of the court; </p><p>though you understand, sir, I’m not trying </p><p>to advise you.” </p><p> “Very well, Lewis,” Bliss replied bluntly.</p><p>“Very well, you take charge of him. And </p><p>I’ll expect you to see that he behaves him- </p><p>self.” </p><p> Tannehill took the boy’s arm and smiled</p><p>down at him. </p><p> “Let’s go, son. It’s all right.”</p><p> “I’ll not go without my gun,” protested</p><p>David, ‘it was my daddy’s!” </p><p> “But it will be safe here,” Tannehill</p><p>assured him. “It’s too heavy to lug </p><p>around, and it’s unlawful. So let’s just </p><p>leave it with the judge; he’ll take good care </p><p>of it.” </p><p> “Certainly, sir; certainly!” said Judge</p><p>Bliss. </p><p> The Faley permitted himself to be led</p><p>out to the street, down the street half the </p><p>length of a city block, up-stairs and into </p><p>an office room over the drug-store. There </p><p>he halted and looked around him. He saw </p><p>books by the hundred, a table littered with </p><p>newspapers, chairs, a rolltop desk, pictures </p><p>on the wall. On the door, which stood </p><p>open, he spelled out words that told him </p><p>that his big friend was a lawyer. </p><p> Then he turned his serious brown eyes</p><p>upon the eyes of Tannehill, he was disap- </p><p>pointed, hurt. </p><p> “So you’re a liar,” he muttered, “and I</p><p>shore did like you.” </p><p> “Most all men are liars,” laughed Tanne-</p><p>hill, “at one time or another.” </p><p> “The Faleys wasn’t,” said David. “I</p><p>ain’t.” </p><p> “We’ll pass it. Why did you ask Larkin</p><p>where the king lived? Where did you get </p><p>that king idea?” </p><p> Out came the old second reader. David</p><p>had not mentioned it during his trial; if </p><p>they took his “gun,” mightn’t they also </p><p>take his story-book? The two sat down, </p><p>and David read to Tannehill the story of </p><p>the tailor and the king. </p><p> “That’s whar I got it,” he said tri-</p><p>umphantly, when he had finished. </p><p> At first, Tannehill was inclined to laugh.</p><p>Then he began to look thoughtful, and a full </p><p>understanding came. Poor little boy! He </p><p>hated to break that pretty dream; far too </p><p>many of the dreams of the world’s dreamers </p><p>had been broken, already. He thought of </p><p>the time, never to be forgotten, when he </p><p>had learned the truth about Santa Claus. </p><p>Suddenly he bent forward and took one of </p><p>David Faley’s dirty little hands, and </p><p>pressed it. </p><p> “Son,” he said, “by coming to Johnsville</p><p>you’ve won something and lost something. </p><p>What you’ve won, the future only can show </p><p>you. What you’ve lost—I swear, I’d </p><p>rather take a horsewhipping than to tell </p><p>you, lad, but there are no kings and queens, </p><p>no knights and ladies, no princes and prin- </p><p>cesses, like those in that book. Those </p><p>are—well, they are just story-people; don’t </p><p>you see?” </p><p> A long talk followed, and it hurt them</p><p>both. David saw, and he believed, at last. </p><p>It was noontime when it was over. The </p><p>boy, half-sick with disillusionment, went </p><p>with his friend toward the great old brick </p><p>home of the Tannehills for dinner. </p><p> It was on this little journey that David</p><p>first saw the girl. She was about twenty- </p><p>four, tall and exceedingly pretty; she had </p><p>blue eyes, and hair that was only a trifle </p><p>darker than the color of old-gold. When </p><p>she saw Tannehill, she blushed, and Tanne- </p><p>hill whispered as he passed her: </p><p> “Four o’clock. Daisies.”</p><p> “Who’s that?” asked David, a moment</p><p>later. </p><p> The answer came readily.</p><p> “Judge Bliss’ daughter, Miss Cordelia.”</p><p>“She’s purtier’n a speckled pup,” said </p><p>David. “Do you like her, Mr. Lew?”</p><p> Mr. Lew looked down at him, and Mr.</p><p>Lew’s countenance was serious. </p><p> “You bet,” he said, “you bet, I like</p><p>her.” </p><p> A tall and bearded old man, an old woman</p><p>in a lacy black dress, and a very good- </p><p>looking young woman in white ate dinner </p><p>with them. The three were young Tanne- </p><p>hill’s father, mother, and sister, and they </p><p>were exceptionally kind to David; they </p><p>were eager to help Lew in making out a list </p><p>of the new clothing the little mountaineer </p><p>would need. </p><p> When the meal was over, David turned</p><p>to old Tannehill with this: </p><p> “You look like my grampaw. You’ve</p><p>got a white beard like him. My grampaw </p><p>was a fine man. He died with a rifle in his </p><p>hands, and the barrel was red-hot; he died </p><p>on his feet, a cussin’ the Wansleys. Mr. </p><p>Lew he said I was a goin’ to live here for </p><p>the present, ef I’d be a good boy. I’m a </p><p>goin’ to be a good boy, shore. Can I call </p><p>you ‘Grampaw?’ ” </p><p>With Pistol and Second Reader </p><p>87 </p><p> George Tannehill seemed at a loss to</p><p>know just what to say. Finally he an- </p><p>swered— </p><p> “You may call me ‘Grandpa’ whenever</p><p>you like, David.” </p><p> There were many times afterward when</p><p>he thought of the incident, and always he </p><p>was glad that he had granted the first wish </p><p>that the boy expressed. For the two were </p><p>thicker than beans in a bag long before a </p><p>frost fell. </p><p>THE Summer ran on, and Johns- </p><p>ville came to know the Faley as </p><p>“the Tannehill boy,” and the latter </p><p>half of August came. Then it was that </p><p>David learned the secret. Two secrets, to </p><p>be exact. </p><p> On a warm Sunday afternoon, when old</p><p>Mr. Tannehill was asleep, and old Mrs. </p><p>Tannehill was visiting the minister’s wife, </p><p>and Miss Anna had company in the parlor, </p><p>and he couldn’t locate Mr. Lew—David </p><p>strolled down to the creek and followed it </p><p>out of town. Suddenly he rounded a short </p><p>bend in the brush-lined stream, and found </p><p>himself facing a pretty little dell filled with </p><p>daisies; and in that dell stood Lew Tanne- </p><p>hill and Judge Bliss’ daughter—and they </p><p>looked as tragic as a pair of professional </p><p>Shakespearean actors in the last act. </p><p>Tannehill stood with the girl’s hands in his, </p><p>and the girl’s eyes were turned downward, </p><p>and both of them were bareheaded. </p><p> Since Tannehill’s back was turned upon</p><p>David, and the girl was looking toward her </p><p>feet, neither knew of the boy’s presence </p><p>near by. Miss Cordelia began to speak in </p><p>a low voice: </p><p> “It’s useless, Lew,” she said sadly. “And</p><p>it’s so very painful. For four years it’s </p><p>been like this. There is utterly no hope </p><p>that we’ll ever be able to marry. Lew, we </p><p>mustn’t love ourselves more than we love </p><p>our—our fathers and mothers. I’m con- </p><p>vinced that we’d better—quit. I’ll promise </p><p>you that I’ll never marry anybody.” </p><p> David saw Lew bend forward and kiss</p><p>Miss Cordelia on the forehead.</p><p> “Not that, Delia,” said he. “Not an</p><p>eternal good-by!” </p><p> “But father and mother are getting old,”</p><p>the young woman went on, “and some day </p><p>they’re going to find out that I’ve been </p><p>slyly meeting you for four years, and then </p><p>—Lew, Lew, I don’t think I could bear it! </p><p>And they are so very kind to me. They’re </p><p>always giving me pretty things and costly </p><p>things. Only yesterday father gave me a </p><p>milk-white saddler that came from Ken- </p><p>tucky—oh, such a beautiful horse!” </p><p> Let me say here parenthetically that this</p><p>fine saddle-horse had been known by its </p><p>Blue Grass keeper as “The White Satan,” </p><p>and that its latest buyer was ■entirely un- </p><p>acquainted with its record; that Judge </p><p>Walter Bliss knew of his daughter’s secret </p><p>meetings with Lew Tannehill, and that he </p><p>was trying to win his daughter back by </p><p>means of overpowering kindliness in massed </p><p>formation. Hence the pretty things, and </p><p>the costly things; and the success he was </p><p>having was proof that old Walter Bliss </p><p>was no stranger to the ways of human </p><p>nature. </p><p> “I saw it,” said Tannehill. “And it</p><p>really is a superb animal. But there’s some </p><p>fire in its eyes yet, and it ought to be better </p><p>broken before you ride it. As to our </p><p>‘quitting’—perhaps you are right, Delia. </p><p>I’ll leave it to you. But I hate the thought </p><p>of it! It makes the whole world look blue.” </p><p> All at once David Faley realized that he</p><p>was doing a most ungentlemanly thing in </p><p>eavesdropping like that. He stole back </p><p>down the creek a hundred yards, took off </p><p>his shoes and stockings, and plunged into </p><p>the shallow water to wade. </p><p> Half an hour, and Lew Tannehill came</p><p>down the creek. He carried his hat in his </p><p>hand, and he seemed very gloomy. At a </p><p>point opposite David, he halted, and the </p><p>lad waded out. </p><p> “Mr. Lew,” began the boy, “I heerd part</p><p>o’ what you and Miss Cordelie said back </p><p>thar. I couldn’t hardly help it. And ever </p><p>sence I heerd it, I’ve been busy wonderin’ </p><p>—why cain’t you and her marry?” </p><p> He had not lost much of his musical hill-</p><p>drawl. Tannehill smiled a little, and that </p><p>little whimsically, and kicked a stone </p><p>into the creek as though it had offended </p><p>him. </p><p> “Don’t you know, son?” he said after a</p><p>silent minute. “But I guess you don’t. </p><p>It isn’t talked of much. Her father and my </p><p>father dislike each other a great deal; it’s </p><p>been like that for years and years. I can </p><p>easily remember the time when they fought </p><p>like wildcats on bare sight of each other. </p><p>It’s queer, too, for they spent their child- </p><p>hood, boyhood, and the early part of their </p><p>manhood as the most inseparable of friends. </p><p>They went fishing, hunting, swimming, did </p><p>88 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>everything, together; where one was, there </p><p>was the other. Then came the quarrel, and </p><p>nobody seems to remember what it was </p><p>about.” </p><p> He couldn’t understand, when he had</p><p>finished, why he had told the lad. Perhaps </p><p>it was his desperation that had done it. </p><p>For just that afternoon he and Cordelia </p><p>Bliss had said what they believed was good- </p><p>by for all time. </p><p> “Why don’t they git up a feud,” frowned</p><p>David, “and use guns and pistols, and have </p><p>it out? That’s the way the Wansleys and </p><p>Faleys—I mean the Faleys and Wansleys </p><p>—done when they got mad.” </p><p> “And you see how it ended, don’t you?”</p><p> David’s gaze fell.</p><p> “You’re right. Yes, I see. Makin’</p><p>friends o’ yore pap and her’n would take </p><p>off all o’ the trouble, wouldn’t it? Ain’t </p><p>the’ no way to make ’em friends?” </p><p> “No way on earth,” and Tannehill shook</p><p>his head. “You’d as well try to stop the </p><p>sun.” </p><p> As they went toward home, the little</p><p>mountaineer was thoughtful. He was try- </p><p>ing to think of some plan by which he him- </p><p>self could unite the two old belligerents. </p><p>It was going to be a big job, he told himself. </p><p>If Mr. Lew had found it as impossible as to </p><p>stop the sun, what could he do? </p><p> But he didn’t give up. He owed Lew</p><p>Tannehill too much to give up. </p><p> Now if the boy Faley was anything, he</p><p>was cunning and resourceful. . He had </p><p>had to be that in order to survive in the </p><p>maelstrom of adverse forces that had been </p><p>in his environment from the day, almost, </p><p>of his birth; and he had inherited cunning </p><p>and resourcefulness from a long line of </p><p>fighting ancestors. He was not a very </p><p>great while in thinking of a scheme that </p><p>offered some promise. </p><p> But—could he bring himself to do the</p><p>thing? </p><p> The difficulty with it was that he would</p><p>have to go back on the religion of his people, </p><p>go back on it squarely. David thought </p><p>over the matter day after day, lay in his </p><p>bed and thought over it night after night. </p><p>It eventually boiled itself down to this, in </p><p>the bottom of the crucible: </p><p> “Do I love my own lowdown self more’n</p><p>I love Mr. Lew and Miss Cordelie?” </p><p> Then, quickly, in the old, stern language</p><p>of his fathers— </p><p> “Ef I go to hell for it, I’ll try it!”</p><p>I l ON THE next Sunday afternoon, </p><p>■LinInfra Walter Bliss took a thick book from </p><p>1.71 his library, went to a corner of his </p><p>broad and shady veranda, and ensconced </p><p>his huge figure comfortably in a wide wicker </p><p>rocker. He had no more than opened the </p><p>book and adjusted his glasses, when there </p><p>was the sound of light footfalls on the floor </p><p>at his right, and he turned his white head </p><p>to see the Tannehill boy. </p><p> “I jest thought I’d come over to see ye,”</p><p>grinned David. “I alius did like you, </p><p>Mr.—Judge Bliss. I ain’t never forgot </p><p>you. I reckon you’ve kept my daddy’s </p><p>pistol good?” </p><p> Old Bliss laughed, closed the book on his</p><p>knees, and put his feet on the veranda </p><p>railing. </p><p> “There’s a chair; sit down,” he nodded.</p><p>“Yes, I’ve taken good care of the revolver. </p><p>I’m glad you came, son, of course; but it’s </p><p>a nine-days wonder the Tannehills would </p><p>let you.” </p><p> David’s heart beat faster as he accepted</p><p>the chair. Now was his golden chance! </p><p> “They said it was all right with them,”</p><p>replied David. “Old Mr. Tannehill he </p><p>told me you was the best man in this end o’ </p><p>the State. He said he’d give a laig clean </p><p>to the hip-j’int ef he could be a boy with you </p><p>ag’in, and go a fishin’ and a swimmin’ and </p><p>a huntin’ with you oncet more. He said— </p><p>he told Grammaw Tannehill—ef he died </p><p>afore he got to shake hands with you and </p><p>be friends, he’d die mighty bad onsatisfied. </p><p>And last night when he held fambly prayers </p><p>he shore axed the Lord to remember you</p><p>and every single one o’ yore folks.” </p><p> Thus did a Faley, and the last of the</p><p>Faleys, lie! </p><p> Judge Bliss took his feet off the veranda</p><p>railing and sat up straight in the wickcr </p><p>rocker. His eyes flashed into the eyes of the </p><p>boy, and the boy did not look away. </p><p>“Which—which Mr. Tannehill?” he </p><p>floundered. “George Tannehill? But— </p><p>yes, yes. Son, he didn’t say that; did he?” </p><p>“He shore did,” bravely. “Cross my </p><p>heart, and hope to die ef he didn’t.” </p><p> The youthful diplomat and liar and hero</p><p>thought it best to change the subject, and </p><p>he did. They talked on about a number of </p><p>things; but the father of Miss Cordelia </p><p>seemed to want to think, rather than to </p><p>talk, and David left him to himself. </p><p> David found Tannehill the elder sitting</p><p>alone in his study, poring over an ancient </p><p>With Pistol and Second Reader </p><p>89 </p><p> law book. He stole up behind the gray</p><p> old man, slipped his hands around and</p><p> pushed the obstructing spectacles gently</p><p> upward, and covered the dim eyes with the</p><p> tips of his fingers.</p><p> “Guess!” he said mischievously, lovingly,</p><p> delightedly.</p><p> George Tannehill winked at himself, so</p><p> to speak.</p><p> “Lew!” he said.</p><p> “Guess ag’in!”</p><p> “Fanny!”</p><p> “Ag’in!” snickered the lad.</p><p> “Mother!”</p><p> “Haw! Haw! Ag’in!”</p><p> “Oh, then it must be David.”</p><p> “That time you got ’er,” laughed David.</p><p> He sat himself down on old Tannehill’s</p><p> knee; they were first-rate pals now.</p><p> “You guessed who I was, grampaw,”</p><p> he went on; “see ef ye can guess whar’ I’ve</p><p> been to.”</p><p> “I’m afraid I can’t.”</p><p> “Blisses, grampaw.”</p><p> “What! Bliss’!” Tannehill was dis-</p><p> pleased.</p><p> “Did you keer?”</p><p> With half the air of having disowned him,</p><p> George Tannehill deliberately placed the</p><p> boy on a near-by chair. Then he bent</p><p> toward David, and his bearded face was</p><p> serious, and his eyes were narrowed. David</p><p> took a fresh hold on himself; this was going</p><p> to be the middle of the bridge for him</p><p> “Did any of the Blisses say anything</p><p> about me?” Tannehill demanded.</p><p> Ironhead Bill Faley’s son seemed to be</p><p> trying to remember.</p><p> “Le’s see, grampaw. What was it he</p><p> did say about you? Oh, yes—I got it now.</p><p> Judge Bliss he told me you and him were</p><p> boys together. He said him and you used</p><p> to go a swimmin’ and a fishin’ and a huntin’</p><p> together. He said he’d give a million</p><p> dollars for jest one o’ them old happy days</p><p> with you. And he said ef he died afore he</p><p> got to shake hands with you and be friends,</p><p> he’d die mighty bad onsatisfied. Then he</p><p> took out his hankercheef and cried awful</p><p> pitiful.”</p><p> George Tannehill was not what one could</p><p> call gullible. For a long minute he bored</p><p> his gaze into the countenance of the boy,</p><p> trying to search out some sign of falsehood.</p><p> But David faced him steadfastly.</p><p> “Son,” finally asked Tannehill, “honestly,</p><p> did Walter Bliss say that?”</p><p> “The’s one thing a Faley never done,</p><p>grampaw,” quietly, convincingly, “and </p><p>that’s tell a lie.” </p><p> It was his last card, and the playing of it</p><p>wrung his heart. </p><p> “My little David,” suddenly said the old</p><p>man, very gently, “I beg your pardon most </p><p>humbly.” </p><p> He rose, and the other watched him.</p><p>He went to his bedroom, put on a fresh shirt </p><p>and collar and tie, and combed his hair very </p><p>carefully; then he found his hat and cane, </p><p>and set out for the home of the Blisses! </p><p>David, filled with misgiving, followed some </p><p>fifty feet behind him, to hear and to see. </p><p> It wasn’t far to the home, of the Blisses,</p><p>and Tannehill’s cane soon stepped off the </p><p>little distance The old ex-judge was </p><p>standing at the gate; he was looking for </p><p>his daughter, who had gone horseback- </p><p>riding more than two hours before. Tanne- </p><p>hill walked up and put out his hand, and </p><p>Bliss gripped it unhesitatingly; they shook </p><p>with a great heartiness, and their chins </p><p>quivered. David crept a few yards closer </p><p>and listened—and that which he heard was </p><p>like a bullet to him: </p><p> “The boy was telling me,” began Tanne-</p><p>hill, “that you said—that you’d like to be </p><p>friends again with me. I—I’m sure I-” </p><p> “I never said any such thing!” exploded</p><p>Walter Bliss, stiffening. “The boy told </p><p>me-” </p><p> The boy wheeled and ran. The greatest</p><p>sacrifice he had been able to make for his </p><p>Mr. Lew, a sacrifice greater than to die, </p><p>had been for nothing! Less than nothing; </p><p>the Tannehills would turn him out, and he </p><p>would be a ragamuffin and an outcast again, </p><p>with not a soul to love him. He had never </p><p>been so badly hurt, so nearly crushed, </p><p>before. But he didn’t cry about it. No- </p><p>body had ever been able to make him cry. </p><p>He had that, at least, left to him. </p><p> When he had gone fifty yards, he halted</p><p>and looked back. The two old men were </p><p>talking in angry tones, and standing as </p><p>straight as a pair of pine trees. He had </p><p>made matters even worse—they were going </p><p>to fight! </p><p>THEN the rapid, ringing sounds of </p><p>hoofbeats came to his ears, and he </p><p>faced the other way. He saw that </p><p>beautiful white horse of Miss Cordelia’s </p><p>coming wildly up the street, with its head </p><p>in the air and foam flying from its nostrils— </p><p>90 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>and Miss Cordelia was on its back and </p><p>clinging desperately to the old-fashioned </p><p>side-saddle; she was as pale as death, too </p><p>badly frightened to even cry out! </p><p> The Faley didn’t stop to think. There</p><p>wasn’t time, anyway. He had a hazy wish </p><p>that he might die and save the girl, as he </p><p>dashed for the middle of the street. As the </p><p>horse was about to pass him, he made a leap </p><p>for its head and caught the reins at the bit </p><p>in both hands and held on grimly. </p><p> A leg splintered under an ironshod hoof;</p><p>a loose nail in another hoof gashed his other </p><p>leg; again and again he was lifted into the </p><p>air and dashed to die stones by that mad </p><p>white Satan of a horse—still he held on, </p><p>held on. And the horse tired of that dead </p><p>weight that it couldn’t shake off, slowed </p><p>down, groaned despairingly and stopped </p><p>squarely in front of Judge Bliss and old </p><p>George Tannehill. </p><p> Miss Cordelia got to the ground somehow,</p><p>and ran to the boy. The two old men, </p><p>themselves and their differences forgotten, </p><p>reached the Faley at the same time. </p><p>Though he seemed to know nothing, the </p><p>lad’s hands were set so tightly on the </p><p>leathern straps that they had to be pried </p><p>open one finger after another, while the </p><p>horse’s eyes blazed with threats of more </p><p>devilment. A dozen neighbors, among </p><p>them a doctor, and Johnsville’s policeman </p><p>ran up. The doctor gathered the limp </p><p>little body, which was now wholly in- </p><p>sensible, into his arms. </p><p> “Take him into my house,” Judge Bliss</p><p>ordered crisply. </p><p> Before he followed, Walter Bliss calmly</p><p>borrowed a revolver from Policeman Sayler, </p><p>and shot the white Satan squarely through </p><p>the brain. </p><p> “So vicious a horse,” he said, “deserves</p><p>it.” </p><p> “Amen,” solemnly growled old George</p><p>Tannehill. </p><p> When David Faley came to, it was late</p><p>at night. He was in a bed that was like</p><p>his own, and yet was not his own. The </p><p>electric droplight was shaded with half a </p><p>newspaper. He tried to move his legs; </p><p>one of them hurt, and the other was numb </p><p>and like wood. Doctor Rankin stepped </p><p>out of the gloom, and Tannehills and </p><p>Blisses followed him. </p><p> “Grampaw!” cried the Faley; and the</p><p>man he had addressed bowed his head and </p><p>went back, stumbling as he went. </p><p> “Lie still, son,” said the doctor, with a</p><p>smile that wasn’t altogether professional. </p><p>“You’ll soon be all right.” </p><p> David went to sleep. At sundown of</p><p>the following day, he awoke to find his mind </p><p>clear of the effects of ether. Standing over </p><p>him were Miss Cordelia and Lew Tannehill, </p><p>and by their faces he knew that they were </p><p>not unhappy. </p><p> “You did a good job of it, after all,</p><p>David,” said Lew. “You see, we figured </p><p>it all out. The old gentlemen are the </p><p>tightest friends in the State, and Delia and </p><p>I are going to be married next month. </p><p>And we’re going to adopt you on the same </p><p>day.” </p><p> David smiled.</p><p> “Well, I’m glad, glad for you folks and</p><p>glad for myself,” he drawled in the old </p><p>drawl of the hills. “And I’m g-glad I </p><p>li-li-lied like I d-d-done-” </p><p> Sniff-sniff! at last, at last.</p><p> After a moment, calmly:</p><p> “Mr. Lew, the fust chanst ye have,</p><p>I	wisht ye’d bring me my second reader,</p><p>which ye’ll find on the table in my room. </p><p>You said the’ wasn’t no people like them </p><p>in that book no more, but—but for me the’s </p><p>alius got to be one king, anyways, and one </p><p>queen.” </p><p> At which a young woman with blue eyes</p><p>and hair a little darker than the color of old- </p><p>gold stooped to kiss him. </p><p> The first part of the story quickly retold in story form</p><p>“\A/HAT?” roared Sir William Berkeley, Governor </p><p>of Virginia. “Five hundred pounds less than </p><p>last year!” </p><p> “Five hundred and sixty-two pounds, six shillings,</p><p>your Excellency,” replied his secretary. </p><p> “There were more traders?” asked the governor.</p><p> “Two more, your Excellency.”</p><p> “We’ve killed off none of the savages. Has less</p><p>fur been taken or have we not received it?” </p><p> “There is no reason, your Excellency, to believe</p><p>that the savages have taken less. They are eager </p><p>enough for the goods.” </p><p> “Have the warden of the gaol conduct that</p><p>disgraceful son of Captain Jeffreys before me at </p><p>once,” commanded the governor. </p><p> “Your life is at stake,” began Sir William, address-</p><p>ing Richard Jeffreys. </p><p> “You have been in gaol under charges of failure to</p><p>attend church, blasphemy, failure to plant corn, </p><p>illicit trade with the Indians, smuggling furs and </p><p>seditious utterances. There is proof enough to </p><p>hang you three times over. But there is a reason I </p><p>have for bringing you here. They tell me you have </p><p>been to the Blue Mountains?” </p><p> “Yes, and beyond,” answered Dick.</p><p> “Then there is hope for you,” said Sir William.</p><p>“The king needs you. Our fur business must be </p><p>controlled as the king would have it. Unlicensed </p><p>traders are visiting the Indians. The Dutch are </p><p>smuggling. A man must go among the Indians, </p><p>win them, must catch these outlaw traders and </p><p>bring information that will permit us to apprehend </p><p>them. Take an oath of allegiance to the king, mend </p><p>your ways and Captain Jeffreys' son may live to be </p><p>a credit to him and to his king. You may have three </p><p>hours in which to decide.” </p><p> The door was opened and Richard Jeffreys was</p><p>led back to the gaol. </p><p> Once more Dick stood before the governor.</p><p> “Well?” demanded Sir William.</p><p> “1 tell you, Governor Berkeley, you and your</p><p>kind have come to the wrong land. I know that </p><p>God set aside this land for men, not kings, for the</p><p>rule of right and justice. And before a hundred </p><p>years have passed men will rule this land.” </p><p> The governor’s face turned purple with rage.</p><p> “Does the noose have to tighten about your neck</p><p>before you come to your senses and acknowledge </p><p>the king and abandon your wild ideas, your seditious </p><p>utterances?” asked Sir William. </p><p> A moment later and Dick’s hands reached out.</p><p>One grasped his excellency’s throat, the other </p><p>closed his mouth and bent back his head. </p><p> “Not a move, or your breast will sheathe your</p><p>dagger,” whispered Jeffreys. </p><p> Binding the governor’s hands and mouth, Dick</p><p>sprang out the window. After two hours of pad- </p><p>dling he drew in to shore at a clump of sycamores. </p><p> “Dick! How did you get away?” asked Elizabeth</p><p>Carver. </p><p> Dick explained the result of his interview with</p><p>Sir William Berkeley. </p><p> Suddenly the girl grasped his arm. They listened.</p><p>The sound of pounding hoofs on the road was </p><p>heard. </p><p> “Your pursuers have cut you off!” she cried.</p><p>“There is a way to escape. Back of the tobacco- </p><p>sheds is a cabin. Go there. I’ll see that you get </p><p>food and water.” </p><p> Dick Jeffreys was in the region of the Great</p><p>Lakes. Months had passed since he left Virginia. </p><p>Standing by a river he saw an approaching canoe. </p><p>In the craft were Basile Pombert, Leon la Gard and </p><p>Michel Charon, French eoureurs de bois. They </p><p>stopped at the bank at Dick's feet. He stepped </p><p>into the canoe. </p><p> Rowing down the river they reached the village</p><p>of the Islinois Indians, with whom the eoureurs de </p><p>bois desired to trade. </p><p> The canoes were unloaded and the exchange of</p><p>knives, muskets, trinkets and brandy for buffalo </p><p>and beaver-skins was begun. </p><p>91 </p><p> Robert Pinkerton</p><p> Authors of “On Guard" “The White Indians,'’ etc.</p><p>9 2 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>CHAPTER VI </p><p>THE MACHINATIONS OF BASILE </p><p>^■ITH night came to the peaceful </p><p>/ village of the Islinois scenes un- </p><p>f dreamed of even in the fiercest </p><p>passions of savage warfare. A </p><p>huge fire blazed high in the space between </p><p>the row of brush and grass cabins and the </p><p>river bank where the Frenchmen had </p><p>landed, and around this, shrieking, reeling, </p><p>their naked bodies glistening with perspira- </p><p>tion in the firelight, circled the warriors of </p><p>the band. </p><p> Basile,-cool, calculating, with an eye for</p><p>everything and every one, poured brandy </p><p>into the greedily extended gourds, but never </p><p>until Leon or Michel had first received a </p><p>bundle of furs, and always with an impar- </p><p>tiality that would result in no warrior es- </p><p>caping the enfiaming consequences of the </p><p>debauch. Basile wanted no laggards, no </p><p>half-sober savages, and so unerringly did he </p><p>estimate the effects of the liquor on each </p><p>one, so skilfully did he apportion the </p><p>brandy, each man and youth in the village </p><p>moved forward to the successive stages of </p><p>drunkenness as uniformly as troops maneu- </p><p>ver on a parade-ground. </p><p> The savages danced and yelled about the</p><p>fire. They still contained control of their </p><p>bodies, though their brains were scorched. </p><p>Constantly men broke away, rushed into </p><p>the darkness and returned with fresh </p><p>bundles of furs, which they tossed at Ba- </p><p>sile’s feet before extending their gourds. </p><p>The brandy was downed at a gulp and, </p><p>freshly inflamed, they whirled away into the </p><p>slirieking circle. </p><p> Except in isolated instances of insolent at-</p><p>tempts to compel larger portions, the white </p><p>men were not molested. Basile had clev- </p><p>erly implanted the idea in their minds at the </p><p>beginning that fur would always bring </p><p>brandy, and nothing else, and automatic- </p><p>ally, as the effects wore off, as more stimu- </p><p>lant was desired, the savages rushed away </p><p>for new bundles of pelts. </p><p> Dick Jeffreys, though in full view of the</p><p>orgy, had little time to note the details of</p><p>the trading. As fast as the fur was re- </p><p>ceived, the brandy doled out, Leon and </p><p>Michel tossed the skins back to him to be </p><p>tied into bundles and piled on the river </p><p>bank close to the canoes. </p><p>It was not the demoralization of the war- </p><p>riors, or even the possible danger to the four </p><p>white men should the savages get beyond </p><p>control, that occupied Dick’s mind as he </p><p>worked rapidly over his bales. Brandy, he </p><p>knew, had always been an accessory to the </p><p>fur trade. The savages had come to ex- </p><p>pect it, and perhaps after all there was no </p><p>harm done in thus transporting them into a </p><p>new world, in furnishing high lights they </p><p>could not otherwise hope for. Surely noth- </p><p>ing had happened so far that could be ob- </p><p>jected to, even the huge price paid for the </p><p>liquor. There was no other brandy within </p><p>a hundred leagues or more, and everywhere </p><p>supply and demand govern price. </p><p> But it was in the attitude of Michel when</p><p>they had transported the weapons across </p><p>the river, in the cold, scheming actions of </p><p>Basile, in a dread of something far worse for </p><p>which he could find no tangible grounds, </p><p>that Dick had his misgivings. As he </p><p>pondered over this, his eyes spared from his </p><p>work as much as possible, a change came. </p><p>As he turned toward the river, laden with fur, </p><p>Basile looked at the shrieking circle of war- </p><p>riors and then glanced at Michel and Leon. </p><p> “Now,” Michel whispered. “Here is the</p><p>chief himself.” </p><p> The leader of the savages, his legs becom-</p><p>ing uncertain in their movements, thrust </p><p>himself forward and tossed a bundle of </p><p>beaver skins at the feet of the white men. </p><p>At the same time his gourd waved uncer- </p><p>tainly toward the cask. </p><p> “You are not generous,” Basile told him</p><p>with a smile. “Have not your women </p><p>scraped these skins? Have they not </p><p>planted the maize? Have they not cared </p><p>for the meat when you have killed it? </p><p>Why then should they not share in your </p><p>rejoicing?” </p><p> The chief’s eyes narrowed as he digested</p><p>this idea, and they glinted selfishly. </p><p> “Just a drink, half a gourd, for your</p><p>wives,” continued Basile. “They have </p><p>earned it. Come! Be generous as befits </p><p>a great chief.” </p><p> Several other Indians had come up to</p><p>calmor for more drink, and they had heard. </p><p>One seemed to find amusement in the idea </p><p>and yelled his approval. But before 'he </p><p>could hand his gourd forward the chief, </p><p>not to be outdone, demanded a full dipper </p><p>for the women of his family. As Basile </p><p>filled it, more generously than ever before, </p><p>the chief turned and called the names of his </p><p>women. </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>93 </p><p> Every woman and child in the village</p><p>had been present at the carousal, sitting in </p><p>a circle outside the dancers, adding to the </p><p>tumult, the women even begging some- </p><p>times for a little of the elixir which seemed </p><p>so to exalt the men. As the chief called </p><p>out, three women arose, one tumbling a </p><p>child from her lap, and ran forward. The </p><p>chief passed the gourd to them and, amid </p><p>much giggling, coughing, sputtering and </p><p>gibes from the others, the liquor was </p><p>downed. </p><p> The warriors immediately clamored for</p><p>brandy for their women and in a moment </p><p>Basile was doling out the fiery stuff faster </p><p>than before. Half an hour later every </p><p>woman in the circle was as intoxicated as </p><p>the men and, joining in the dance, they out- </p><p>stripped the braves with their shrill screams </p><p>and contortions. </p><p> With the advent of the women the char-</p><p>acter of the orgy began to change swiftly. </p><p>The crowd of dancers about the fire was </p><p>more dense. One brave stepped on an- </p><p>other’s feet and was knocked down. He </p><p>arose, pulled a burning stick from the fire </p><p>and struck his adversary across the face, </p><p>blinding him and sending him reeling </p><p>through the blaze. </p><p> The encounter pleased the crowd and at</p><p>the same time aroused a desire for conflict. </p><p>Several fights started. Two men wrestled </p><p>impotently for a time, a yelping circle of </p><p>demons about them. Then one, with a </p><p>snap like that of a fear-maddened beast, </p><p>bit off the other’s nose. </p><p> A woman, shrieking hysterically, pulled a</p><p>burning stick from the fire and held it </p><p>across the bare back of a dancing warrior. </p><p>He cried in agony and then whirled and </p><p>thrust the woman into the fire, where she </p><p>stumbled and fell and then rushed out from </p><p>the other side, her hair a blazing torch. </p><p> On every side personal encounters</p><p>started. Without weapons, unable to strike </p><p>or wrestle effectively, the savages resorted </p><p>to snapping and tearing with their teeth. </p><p>Noses and ears were bitten off, chunks of </p><p>flesh were ripped from backs and breasts </p><p>and shoulders. Blood flowed down the</p><p>bare bodies of the men and soaked the </p><p>scanty skifa garments of the women. </p><p> One woman suddenly ran from the circle,</p><p>snatched up a sleeping infant from the arms </p><p>of an older child and, with a fiendish shriek, </p><p>hurled it into the center of the flames. </p><p>The little body writhed for a few moments, </p><p>its skin scorched and crinkled. Then it lay </p><p>quite still. </p><p> Dick, stupefied by the horror of the</p><p>scene, did not realize for a time that no </p><p>more furs were forthcoming, though the </p><p>gourds were kept full. Basile was assisted </p><p>in the dispensation by both Leon and </p><p>Michel. All three worked swiftly, their </p><p>faces alight in anticipation, seemingly </p><p>oblivious of the horror about them. </p><p> At last Basile rolled out a cask, knocked</p><p>in the head and waved the savages toward </p><p>it. There was a scramble immediately, </p><p>the clattering of gourds drowned out by </p><p>yells and screams. Fights were started </p><p>everywhere, blood flowed to the accom- </p><p>paniment of shrieks of anguish. Men and </p><p>women reeled and weaved about aimlessly. </p><p>Some swayed and fell, to lie motionless, </p><p>completely overcome, or to struggle vainly </p><p>to rise. One warrior stumbled and plunged </p><p>down the bank, falling with his head and </p><p>shoulders in the water. His feet kicked for </p><p>a time, but his body only slid farther in the </p><p>mud and at last it disappeared without </p><p>leaving a ripple on the water. </p><p> “Come, Dick!” cried Leon. “The time</p><p>has arrived. Be quick!” </p><p> He dashed off after Michel and Basile</p><p>but the Virginian, sickened by the events </p><p>of the evening, comparing the bestial crea- </p><p>tures before his eyes with the happy, con- </p><p>tented, smiling, friendly people he had </p><p>seen only a few hours before, remained </p><p>where he stood, too stunned even to com- </p><p>prehend the reality of this complete and </p><p>wanton degradation. </p><p>AS HE watched, the very horror </p><p>of the scene began to compel </p><p>a realization of the crime in which </p><p>he had had a part. His paralysis became </p><p>that of enervating disgust and repulsion, of </p><p>self-accusation and remorse. </p><p> “Come, you English fool!” cried Basile</p><p>from behind him. “Get into the cabins at </p><p>once. We must be away soon.” </p><p> Dick whirled to see the Frenchman’s evil</p><p>face scowling at him from above a heap of </p><p>trade-goods with which his arms were laden. </p><p>Basile dumped his burden down on the </p><p>bank beside the furs and again faced </p><p>Dick. </p><p> “You beast!” cried the Virginian, stung</p><p>at last to action by the realization that his </p><p>companions were about to terminate their </p><p>visit by stealing all they had traded, by </p><p>94 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>robbing these unsuspecting, friendly chil- </p><p>dren not only of their innocence but even of </p><p>the very price of it. </p><p> He leaped forward and struck Basile in</p><p>the face with all his strength. The French- </p><p>man reeled against a savage and then, </p><p>cursing hysterically, sprang back to meet </p><p>the attack. Dick stepped to one side and </p><p>again his fist found Basile’s face. At the </p><p>same instant a stick of wood thrown by a </p><p>drunken warrior sent the Virginian reeling </p><p>down the bank beside the Frenchman. </p><p> Basile met him, not with a blow, but with</p><p>a steadying arm. </p><p> “Watch!” he commanded. “The sav-</p><p>ages have turned upon us. Leon! Michel!” </p><p>Dick whirled at Basile’s side to see a </p><p>group of shrieking warriors charging down </p><p>upon them, led by the one against whom </p><p>Basile had fallen and who had struck Dick in </p><p>retaliation. </p><p> “Your fists,” advised Basile. “Strike</p><p>quick and hard and don’t let them get their </p><p>arms about you.” </p><p> Side by side he and Dick met the charge</p><p>of the reeling, crazed savages. Two went </p><p>down, then a third. But others took their </p><p>places and the white men, to evade the </p><p>clutching arms and gleaming teeth, would </p><p>have been forced back into the river had </p><p>not Michel and Leon charged into them </p><p>with swinging muskets. </p><p> No more than a dozen Indians had taken</p><p>part in the attack. The others, apparently </p><p>uninterested, still circled about the fire. </p><p> “I’ll attend to you later, English dog!”</p><p>Basile whispered in Dick’s ear as he turned </p><p>away to follow Leon and Michel to the </p><p>cabins and fresh plundering. </p><p> The Frenchmen left Dick standing above</p><p>the bodies of the savages they load knocked </p><p>senseless. Instinctively he started after </p><p>the coureurs dc bois and then his utter help- </p><p>lessness in the face of all that had hap- </p><p>pened broght him up with a start. </p><p> The Indians were mad with liquor, past</p><p>control, past help of any kind. Once they </p><p>had recovered, once they learned all that </p><p>had been done to them, their desire for </p><p>vengeance would be boundless. Now the </p><p>damage had been done. Dick could only </p><p>hope to escape with the Frenchmen and </p><p>settle with Basile afterward. ' </p><p> To rid himself at least of the sight of this</p><p>rape of an innocent people the Virginian </p><p>started down the bank of the river, seeking </p><p>the darkness beyond the circle of the fire. </p><p>He stumbled blindly on among some </p><p>bushes, stopping only when he heard a low </p><p>cry and sounds of a struggle in front of him. </p><p>At the same instant a warrior applied a </p><p>torch to the grass roof of a cabin and the </p><p>whole village was lighted instantly. </p><p> The first rays disclosed to Dick a young</p><p>girl struggling in the arms of Basile. The </p><p>Frenchman’s face was red from her </p><p>scratches, but he only laughed and held her </p><p>more tightly. </p><p> Instantly Dick was upon him, striking,</p><p>tearing at his arms, beating his face and </p><p>head and shoulders. Basile dropped the </p><p>girl with a curse and reached for his knife. </p><p>As it slipped from his belt Dick swung with </p><p>all his strength and his fist met the French- </p><p>man’s jaw. He dropped silently into the </p><p>grass. </p><p> Dick turned to find the girl watching him</p><p>in wonder. </p><p> “When you played with my little brother</p><p>today,” she began suddenly, “I knew you </p><p>were not like the others. Now you have </p><p>saved me. So I shall tell you something to </p><p>save you. My father once journeyed far to </p><p>the north, to a great lake your people call </p><p>Superior. He saw Frenchmen there, like </p><p>yourselves, and he saw them give brandy </p><p>to our people. Today he would not taste of </p><p>it, nor would he let me, and when you began </p><p>to give brandy to us he went down the river </p><p>to tell the warriors of the next village. </p><p>They come soon, and then there will be </p><p>stakes, and pine splinters, for all of you.” </p><p> The seriousness of her manner had com-</p><p>manded Dick’s attention and, although he </p><p>had been unable to comprehend all of her </p><p>speech, he had grasped enough of it to have </p><p>a clear idea of her meaning.</p><p> “You say,” he asked, “that your father</p><p>will lead the warriors against us?” </p><p> For answer she held up her hand.</p><p> “Listen,” she said simply.</p><p> A single war-whoop sounded from down</p><p>the river, a cry stabbing through the dark- </p><p>ness and the dying clamor about the fire. </p><p>Instantly Dick stooped and lifted Basile’s </p><p>limp body. With a struggle he swung it to </p><p>his shoulder and set off along the bank </p><p>toward the canoes. </p><p> “Leon! Michel!” he cried as he stag-</p><p>gered beneath his burden. “Quick, or we </p><p>are lost!” </p><p> As he came to the dance-fire the two</p><p>Frenchmen, their arms full of loot, rushed </p><p>down to the canoes. </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>95 </p><p> “Quick!” Dick commanded. “To your</p><p>paddles. The warriors of the next village </p><p>are here.” </p><p> “What of it?” demanded Leon. “We’ll</p><p>get them drunk, too.” </p><p> “But they have been warned by one from</p><p>this village, one who would not drink, and </p><p>they have been told that we robbed and </p><p>killed after making them mad. It’s the </p><p>stake for all of us.” </p><p> “Nonsense!” Michel retorted. “There</p><p>is-” </p><p> His words were drowned by a yell from the</p><p>edge of the village that froze all three for an </p><p>instant. Then as one man they turned to </p><p>the canoe into which Dick had dumped </p><p>Basile, threw in their muskets and leaped </p><p>after them. Dick in the bow, Michel in the </p><p>stern, Leon kneeling astride his uncon- </p><p>scious companion, they paddled as they had </p><p>never paddled before. </p><p> But before they had pulled away from the</p><p>light of the burning cabin Dick looked over </p><p>his shoulder to see a stream of naked war- </p><p>riors flow through the circle about the fire. </p><p>There was a yell, shrill, high above the bed- </p><p>lam of the camp, echoing like the staccato </p><p>cry of the wolf that snaps at the haunches </p><p>of a deer. A glistening arm pointed toward </p><p>the shadow of the fleeing canoe and the </p><p>next instant arrows rained on the water </p><p>about it. </p><p>CHAPTER VII </p><p>HIDDEN ENEMIES </p><p>THE Islinois River was too wide for </p><p>effective archery and the canoe was </p><p>turned toward the opposite bank where, </p><p>blending with the shadows, it sped on up- </p><p>stream, unseen by the savages and un- </p><p>heard, for the paddles dipped noiselessly. </p><p> All three men knew, however, that this</p><p>did not mean safety. Down-stream they </p><p>might have out-distanced their pursuers, </p><p>only to put leagues of hostile territory </p><p>between them and Lac Mecheygan. Up- </p><p>stream, following the many convolutions</p><p>of the river, fighting the current, there was </p><p>no hope of escape after daylight came. </p><p>Knowing each bend, each shallow place </p><p>where they could ford or swam, the savages </p><p>could easily strike across country and cut </p><p>them off at dawn. To abandon the canoe </p><p>would be equally fatal, for every foot of </p><p>both banks would be examined in the first </p><p>light of the new day. </p><p> For the present, in the darkness and with</p><p>the river between them and the savages, </p><p>they were safe. A few of the Islinois had </p><p>attempted to follow in the canoe left behind </p><p>but their unfamiliarity with the craft per- </p><p>mitted the eoureurs de bois to out-distance </p><p>them easily. The three men drove ahead </p><p>with all their strength. They could hear </p><p>their pursuers on the opposite bank, and </p><p>sometimes an arrow plumped into the water </p><p>near them. But the stream was straight </p><p>and broad and with little current for sev- </p><p>eral leagues and after an hour there were </p><p>no sounds of the Indians. </p><p> Basile recovered consciousness at last and</p><p>attempted to rise. </p><p> “Lie still,” whispered Leon as he laid</p><p>aside his paddle and placed both hands on </p><p>Basile’s shoulders. “Don’t speak above a </p><p>whisper. The savages pursue us. When </p><p>you feel able to sit up your blade will be </p><p>welcome.” </p><p> “If I am needed,” was the answer, “I</p><p>am well able to paddle now. There are no </p><p>broken bones. I only lost all knowledge </p><p>of life for a time. Where is that dog of an </p><p>Englishman?” </p><p> “He is here, ahead. ’Twas he that car-</p><p>ried you to the canoe, else you would even </p><p>now be wearing pine splinters. Never </p><p>mind him for the present. It needs the </p><p>strength and skill of all four to escape the </p><p>shrieking devils on the bank. It is the stake </p><p>for all of us if we are caught. Use your </p><p>blade now and settle your quarrels later.” </p><p>“Very well,” said Basile as he arose cau- </p><p>tiously to his knees. “Give me a paddle. </p><p>I	can wait.”</p><p> “Well said,” Leon encouraged. “Now</p><p>to work for another league. Then we can </p><p>stop for breath and perhaps a plan.” </p><p> All four now bent to their work and the</p><p>canoe was fairly lifted from the water as </p><p>the paddles went into the stream in perfect </p><p>unison. They sped on, faster than the </p><p>Indians could run on land, and after half </p><p>an hour Michel called a halt in the shadow of </p><p>a small, heavily wooded island in midriver. </p><p> “I have no breath left,” he gasped as he</p><p>took hold of a w'illow branch to anchor the </p><p>canoe. “We can’t keep that up for long, </p><p>and there are several big bends beyond. </p><p>By morning they will surely be ahead.” </p><p>“And if we did outstrip them we would </p><p>only run into the Miamis, who would treat </p><p>us no better,” said Leon. </p><p> “I have a plan,” whispered Dick as he</p><p>96 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>turned in the bow. “A quarter of a league </p><p>above us a stream comes in from the left. </p><p>It is large enough for the canoe, so large </p><p>it must come from some distance. I re- </p><p>member it because Michel and I stopped </p><p>to shoot a deer just above it before we </p><p>camped at the place where we first saw the </p><p>Islinois.” </p><p> “The savages are on that bank and can</p><p>follow it easily,” sneered Basile. “We </p><p>would only be running into them.” </p><p> “No, it is our only chance,” declared</p><p>Dick. “Ahead the river makes a turn to </p><p>the right and then almost doubles back </p><p>upon itself. It is at the upper end of that </p><p>big bend that they will hope to be in ahead </p><p>of us at daylight. They will not believe </p><p>that we would turn off and let them get </p><p>between us and Lac Mecheygan. If we </p><p>hurry now and go up this small stream </p><p>before they come to it we can leave them </p><p>behind and without a trace of the direction </p><p>we have taken and without a suspicion </p><p>that we are not ahead. From the head- </p><p>waters of this stream we can surely reach </p><p>some place of safety to the north.” </p><p> “Monsieur Dick is right!” agreed Michel</p><p>enthusiastically. “The canoe leaves no </p><p>trace. We can turn up this stream for </p><p>many leagues and who knows but that we </p><p>may cross over to the Rocky River that </p><p>comes down from near the land of the </p><p>Puans, or Ouinibegous. A Mascouten once </p><p>told me that the Rocky River flowed down </p><p>along the border of the Islinois country and </p><p>at last entered the Misisepe.” </p><p> “It is our only chance,” said Leon.</p><p>“Come! Let us be on the way to this </p><p>stream before they reach it.” </p><p> “But how do we know we will reach this</p><p>Rocky River?” objected Basile. </p><p> “Even if we don’t, it is better than let-</p><p>ting these devils burn us at the stake, as </p><p>they will before another night if we are not on </p><p>our way,” retorted Michel. “Monsieur Dick </p><p>is right. It is the only thing we can do.” </p><p>Again the canoe was shot swiftly up- </p><p>stream and in a few minutes Dick signaled </p><p>from the bow that they were opposite the</p><p>mouth of the river flowing in from the </p><p>north. For a moment they listened intently </p><p>but there was no sign of life on either shore. </p><p>“Paddle,” whispered Michel. “It’s a </p><p>chance, but one we should be glad to take.” </p><p>Silently, cautiously, each man’s nerves </p><p>taut, the canoe was driven close to the </p><p>north bank. Alone on the water, it could </p><p>be seen easily from the shore. Yet there </p><p>were no savage yells, no arrows dropping </p><p>about them. </p><p> “We are in time,” whispered Leon. “We</p><p>have headed them. Come! Up this stream </p><p>before they do suspect us.” </p><p> The canoe stole into the shadows of the</p><p>trees bordering the smaller river as if into </p><p>a tunnel and the silent paddles shot it on </p><p>through the darkness. For an hour they </p><p>continued, the tension growing less until, </p><p>when they came to a wide, open marsh </p><p>through which the stream twisted in a long </p><p>series of bends and ox-bows, there was no </p><p>longer fear of immediate pursuit. But </p><p>none of the men even hoped for safety there </p><p>and so long as the night lasted they con- </p><p>tinued to paddle. </p><p> The first signs of dawn found them five</p><p>or six leagues from the Islinois River and </p><p>out of the big marsh. The banks were </p><p>higher, trees had come again, although the </p><p>stream was narrower and twisted and </p><p>turned until they would have lost all sense </p><p>of direction had it not been for the stars. </p><p> “There’s our salvation,” whispered Leon</p><p>excitedly as the stream suddenly widened </p><p>in a little valley and in the center of the </p><p>pond, which was about an eighth of a </p><p>league across, they could see the dark </p><p>shadow of a small island. “We’ll crawl </p><p>into the brush on that isle, hide the canoe </p><p>and sleep until night. If they should come </p><p>this way after us they’d never find us </p><p>there.” </p><p> There was a ready acceptance of this</p><p>proposal as all were near exhaustion. Be- </p><p>fore daylight they and their canoe were </p><p>safely hidden and, each taking his turn as </p><p>look-out, they slept until nightfall. </p><p>AGAIN the hours of darkness were </p><p>spent in putting more leagues be-</p><p>tween them and the Islinois River, </p><p>but not long after midnight they found the </p><p>stream had grown so small that further </p><p>progress by canoe was impossible. </p><p> “Now we are trapped!” exclaimed Basile.</p><p>“We can’t go on without leaving footprints </p><p>on the bank, even could we hide the canoe </p><p>so that they would not find it.” </p><p> “There is still the good chance that they</p><p>never suspected our coming this way,” </p><p>objected Dick. “If we land now we need </p><p>only strike straight north until we come to </p><p>this Rocky River of which Michel has </p><p>heard. If we are pursued there is still the </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>97 </p><p>possibility of our getting to the Rocky </p><p>River first. When we reach that and the </p><p>land of the Puans we will be safe.” </p><p> “To be sure,” agreed Michel. “It is</p><p>the only course open to us. Dick and I </p><p>will carry the canoe and you two the mus- </p><p>kets. We can change each league.” </p><p> “And perhaps carry it a dozen leagues,”</p><p>growled Basile. </p><p> “I’d carry it a thousand rather than</p><p>have those devils on my back,” declared </p><p>Leon. “It is the only way out of the </p><p>difficulty, so let’s be at it.” </p><p> They were in a country of which white</p><p>men knew nothing, far off any possible </p><p>water route, and they were not even cer- </p><p>tain that the Rocky River existed or that, </p><p>if it did, they could reach it by traveling </p><p>north. Moreover, none of the men had </p><p>eaten since the night of their flight and, so </p><p>long as there was danger of pursuit, they </p><p>could not risk the time for, or the noise of, </p><p>getting game. They had fled with only </p><p>one canoe, their muskets and powder-horns </p><p>and ball pouches, from which they were never </p><p>separated when among strange savages. </p><p> The eoureurs de bois were accustomed to</p><p>famine as well as to feasting, however, and </p><p>Dick would have been the last to complain </p><p>of the weakness of hunger. The fear of the </p><p>vengeance of the ravished Islinois was still </p><p>with them, and all knew the fate that </p><p>awaited should they be overtaken. </p><p> Accordingly as they struck off across the</p><p>level prairie in the light of the st*rs they </p><p>forgot their burdens in the desire for this </p><p>unknown river. Each hour they walked a </p><p>league, and each hour the bearers of the </p><p>canoe exchanged their burden for the </p><p>scarcely less heavy or awkward and irk- </p><p>some muskets and powder-horns. </p><p> The agreement they had made for carry-</p><p>ing the canoe kept Dick and Michel to- </p><p>gether, but the heavy work left little op- </p><p>portunity for discussion, even had Dick </p><p>felt that it would be possible to gain Mi- </p><p>chel’s support in his quarrel. That Basile </p><p>was allowing no time to elapse before mak-</p><p>ing plans for revenge was easily evident in </p><p>the manner in which he drew Leon ahead </p><p>that they might talk without being heard. </p><p> There was nothing, however, the Vir-</p><p>ginian could do. His only chance for safety </p><p>lay in remaining with the eoureurs de bois </p><p>and so great was the problem that con- </p><p>fronted them he put aside his trouble with </p><p>Basile for future settlement and gave his </p><p> entire attention to searching for signs of</p><p>the much desired river. x </p><p>The country was either flat or rolling, </p><p>usually treeless. Once their hunger was </p><p>doubled when they encountered a small </p><p>herd of buffalo and were compelled to go </p><p>on without trying a shot. Twice their </p><p>hopes were aroused when the land dipped </p><p>and they were forced to skirt a marsh. </p><p>But each time higher land came to rob </p><p>them of their hopes for a river. </p><p> Daylight brought them to a forest of</p><p>oaks and under their shelter they continued. </p><p> “Not another step will I carry that</p><p>beast!” cried Leon when his turn came to </p><p>abandon one end of the canoe. </p><p> “You’ll only exchange that burden for</p><p>the tortures of purgatory,” declared Michel. </p><p>“Look at the trail we are leaving. Those </p><p>savages could follow it with their eyes </p><p>swathed. Come on! Wood usually means </p><p>water in this prairie country. The liver </p><p>may be just beyond.” </p><p> Half an hour more brought them to the</p><p>banks of a broad stream and without the </p><p>waste of a moment they put it between </p><p>them and possible pursuit. </p><p> “Noise or no noise,” said Michel as they</p><p>landed on the north side, “I’m going to </p><p>have a stag for breakfast.” </p><p> “I’ll go with you,” said Basile as he</p><p>picked up his musket. “Two shots are no </p><p>louder than one.” </p><p> Dick and Leon carried the canoe out of</p><p>sight behind some bushes and lay down to </p><p>rest. In less than an hour the hunters re- </p><p>turned with a young buck and the good </p><p>news that they had discovered traces of a </p><p>recent camp of Mascouten hunters. </p><p> “It means we are in their country and</p><p>the Islinois will not dare foHow us much </p><p>farther,” said Michel. “We can risk the </p><p>smoke of a fire so long as we have chanced </p><p>the noise of a shot, and then we’ll put a few </p><p>more leagues between us and the Islinois.” </p><p>They ate the meat when it was little </p><p>more than scorched. After the meal, which </p><p>left little of the buck, Basile took the hide </p><p>and, inserting his knife in the center, began </p><p>to cut around and around until he had a </p><p>thong half an inch wide and several yards </p><p>long. Silently he handed one end to </p><p>Michel and, passing it back and forth </p><p>through the fire, they burned off the hair. </p><p>Once or twice during the operation Basile </p><p>glanced at Dick, a hard smile on his cruel </p><p>mouth. </p><p>98 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Now we’ll be going,” he said when they</p><p>had finished. “We should be a dozen </p><p>leagues farther away by night and perhaps </p><p>in the village of the Mascoutens.” </p><p> All day they paddled toward the north-</p><p>east and not once was there evidence that </p><p>they were followed by the Islinois. Be- </p><p>cause fear of the savages was still with them, </p><p>however, they paddled swiftly and without </p><p>speaking. Hour after hour they went on </p><p>and on, silent, watchful, always swiftly. </p><p> Even in the silence, and despite the</p><p>natural cause of it, Dick began to feel the </p><p>presence of a barrier between him and the </p><p>other three. The hostility of Basile was </p><p>to be expected and from it he knew that, </p><p>when safety was certain, there would come </p><p>a decisive struggle. But Michel and Leon, </p><p>amiable, carefree, light-hearted, he had </p><p>once considered firm friends. That his </p><p>apparent criticism of their plundering </p><p>methods should have lost for him some of </p><p>their regard he had no doubt, but he had </p><p>not expected the complete change in them </p><p>that he now felt. </p><p> In the first hurried flight from the Isli-</p><p>nois and the hours of anxious search for the </p><p>Rocky River this enmity had not been so </p><p>evident. Now the more leagues they put </p><p>between them and the aroused savages the </p><p>more Dick sensed the fact that he was not </p><p>only going deeper and deeper into an un- </p><p>known land but that he was going alone. He </p><p>remembered how Basile and Leon had gone </p><p>on ahead, how he had overheard their </p><p>voices in argument when they made the </p><p>long portage in the night. He recalled the </p><p>alacrity with which Basile had joined </p><p>Michel in the hunt that morning. </p><p> But night and a camp on the bank of</p><p>the river came before he found a tangible </p><p>basis for his suspicions. Michel wandered </p><p>off with his musket as soon as they landed </p><p>and returned with another buck and again </p><p>with news of a still more recent camp of </p><p>Mascouten hunters. Basile’s interest was </p><p>at once aroused and, on one pretext or an- </p><p>other, he drew first Leon and then Michel </p><p>aside. </p><p>BUT still nothing was said, noth-</p><p>ing was done, no mention was made </p><p>of the disaster to their plans on the </p><p>river of the Islinois. Then, after supper, </p><p>when each had selected a comfortable place </p><p>beside the fire, Basile spoke: </p><p> “Michel! Leon! You will remember</p><p> that on the Chicagon I protested against</p><p>taking this Englishman with us. You will </p><p>remember that we started from Montreal </p><p>with the fixed plan of trading among the </p><p>Islinois, and you will remember the hopes </p><p>we had for a most successful venture. You </p><p>will remember, too, your debts, which must </p><p>be paid on your return or there is to be no </p><p>return. </p><p> “What has happened? This English-</p><p>man forced himself upon us, with pleasant </p><p>words enough but with what actions?” </p><p> “I’ll back up those actions with words,</p><p>and the words, in turn, with more action!” </p><p>interrupted Dick angrily. “As for your </p><p>acts, Basile Pombert, there are no words </p><p>to express the scorn of an honest man for </p><p>them.” </p><p> “And he is the man who bragged that</p><p>he is an outlaw!” laughed Leon. “The </p><p>one who came to the French country to </p><p>gain freedom, to escape the law. He talks </p><p>like a blackrobe.” </p><p> “I came for freedom, yes,” replied Dick,</p><p>his anger increased by Leon thus openly </p><p>alining himself with Basile. “But I do </p><p>not call it freedom to gain the opportunity </p><p>to rob, to cheat, to ravish. I sought free- </p><p>dom, but not a license from Satan himself, </p><p>nor did I seek the arts of the imps of hell. </p><p>An outlaw I am, but a man may flee the </p><p>wrath of a king and still be honest, still </p><p>remember that he is better than the beasts.” </p><p>“He should have been a Jesuit,” laughed </p><p>Basile. '“He should carry the cross, not </p><p>honest brandy, to the pagan savages. </p><p>Would not that Pere Marquette at Michili- </p><p>makinac have rejoiced to hear him?” </p><p> Angry as Dick was he was not without</p><p>caution, and in this jeering attitude of </p><p>Basile he recognized a greater danger than </p><p>he had expected. The Frenchman felt </p><p>that he was playing a safe hand, that he </p><p>was merely testing his power, merely whet- </p><p>ting his appetite for the enjoyment of the</p><p>final victory. </p><p> Dick’s contempt for the man, his repul-</p><p>sion, and his memory, still vivid, of that </p><p>last night on the Islinois, caused him to </p><p>minimize the danger. </p><p> “Call it the cross or what you will,” he</p><p>retorted angrily, “had I been told, Basile, </p><p>what you planned doing to those innocent </p><p>people you ravished I would have pre- </p><p>vented it, even if I had been forced to wring </p><p>your serpent’s neck to accomplish it.” </p><p> “And accomplish it you did, son of an</p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>99 </p><p>English dog!” cried Basile, displaying anger </p><p>for the first time. “As I was telling Leon </p><p>and Michel, we planned much, we hoped to </p><p>return to the St. Lawrence with the where- </p><p>withal for a glorious time. What has pre- </p><p>vented it? This English swine forced </p><p>himself upon us and then robbed us of our </p><p>hard-earned reward. His talk is pretty, but </p><p>his actions are those of a spy, as I first said, </p><p>and that night on the Islinois, I tell you, </p><p>he showed his real self. I saw him talking </p><p>with this girl, the one who left these marks </p><p>on my face, and with her father, and he </p><p>told them a false story of our being rob- </p><p>bers, brigands, even murderers. What </p><p>happened? This old man warned another </p><p>village, and here we are, penniless, fugitives, </p><p>victims of an English spy.” </p><p> “You lie, Pombert,” interrupted Dick in</p><p>a low voice. “You lie and you knowyou </p><p>lie. But I will say this. Had I known </p><p>what you intended, had I known how to </p><p>prevent what you did, I would have taken </p><p>any risk to defeat you. From the first </p><p>you have shown yourself to be a sneak, an </p><p>ungrateful cur, a beast in the shape of a </p><p>man, but with no other human attributes. </p><p>I would not try to shame you by reminding </p><p>you that, had I not carried you to the canoe, </p><p>you would even now be a shriveled cinder </p><p>on an Islinois stake. I claim no credit for </p><p>that. It was a selfish act, for I was only </p><p>saving you for death at my own hands.” </p><p> The Virginian had spoken calmly but in</p><p>deadly earnest and as he finished he started </p><p>to rise. Instantly Basile rolled across the </p><p>ground and grasped him about the knees. </p><p>Leon and Michel, springing to their feet, </p><p>threw themselves at Dick’s shoulders and </p><p>waist. Striking, exerting all his strength </p><p>to throw them off, he went down beneath </p><p>them and before he had ceased struggling </p><p>the long strip of rawhide Basile had cut </p><p>held his arms and legs. </p><p> The three Frenchmen, panting, wiping</p><p>the perspiration from their faces, took seats </p><p>across the fire from their captive. </p><p> “Now what?” asked Leon.</p><p> “A big canoe and a full one on our re-</p><p>turn to the St. Lawrence before Winter</p><p>sets in,” answered Basile. </p><p> “And you can talk like, that without</p><p>brandy?” demanded Michel in mock amaze- </p><p>ment. </p><p> “Be silent, you two with the sheep’s</p><p>heads!” commanded Basile sternly. “You </p><p>are like horses. You can work if well </p><p>driven, but, turned loose in a field, how </p><p>much could you plow? I planned the </p><p>most successful endeavor of our lives. You </p><p>meddled, took this English dog along de- </p><p>spite my wishes, and see what has hap- </p><p>pened. Tell me, both of you, who of us </p><p>has the head? Who can plan?” </p><p> “You are right, Basile,” answered Leon</p><p>humbly. “We have been wrong. Lead </p><p>and we will follow, anywhere. Is it not so, </p><p>Michel?” </p><p> “Even to this Misisepe, be it fresh or</p><p>salt, full of monsters or no,” was the reply. </p><p> “Then listen,” said Pombert, pressing</p><p>his advantage, “and you shall learn how we </p><p>shall drift down the St. Lawrence with a </p><p>big canoe and a full one before Winter </p><p>comes. </p><p> “We can not go many leagues up this</p><p>river without finding the Mascoutens. </p><p>You have heard tell of them. They are </p><p>warlike, but there are not enough of them </p><p>to be successful. They like prisoners and </p><p>the pleasures of the stake but have few </p><p>captives. They are tricky and they are </p><p>vain. What do you think would please </p><p>them most?” </p><p> “A cask of brandy,” offered Leon.</p><p> “To be gone in a night! No! We have</p><p>that which they would desire most, a white </p><p>man for slave, for prisoner, for torture. </p><p>Do you not see? A word or two in the </p><p>chief’s ear, a story of the English king who </p><p>sent a man to take the lands of the Mas- </p><p>coutens for himself, of how, if he returns </p><p>to his ruler it will be to lead an army into </p><p>this peaceful land and slay every savage. </p><p>We can say that by torturing this prisoner </p><p>their young men will become strong and </p><p>brave, so strong and brave they will be </p><p>successful even against the Longhouses. </p><p> “They have never had a white prisoner.</p><p>It will be easy for us to mold their simple </p><p>minds to the belief that torturing one re- </p><p>leases to them all the white man’s strength. </p><p>Oh, no!” and he grinned across the fire at </p><p>Dick. “We’ll make this Englishman long </p><p>for the noose of his king.” </p><p> “And how does that load the canoe?”</p><p>asked Michel. </p><p> “You fool!” replied Basile. “Must I</p><p>even expand your chest so that your lungs </p><p>may receive the breath of life? For this </p><p>great gift to them we will receive a big </p><p>canoe and every pelt of every kind in their </p><p>village. This English devil lost us a year’s </p><p>profits. Let him repay us.” </p><p>100 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> The next morning only three paddles</p><p>dipped into the waters of the Rocky River. </p><p>In the bottom of the canoe, still bound, lay </p><p>Dick Jeffreys. All night the Frenchmen </p><p>had taken turns guarding him and now he </p><p>was constantly under the eye of all. Once </p><p>in the night he had pleaded with Michel, </p><p>sought to win again the friendship the </p><p>courcur de bois had first displayed, only to </p><p>find that the influence of Basile, coupled </p><p>with the poverty of the trio, held full </p><p>sway. </p><p> At noon they entered a long stretch of</p><p>the river with rounded bluffs, heavily </p><p>wooded, on either side. At the far end </p><p>where the river curved was a flat, treeless </p><p>expanse and grouped in the center of this </p><p>were a score or more of cabines. </p><p> “The Mascoutens!” cried Leon from the</p><p>bow. </p><p> “And see that you leave all the talk to</p><p>me,” cautioned Basile. “I want no bung- </p><p>ling here.” </p><p> For a day the Frenchmen feasted with</p><p>the savages, observing the native custom </p><p>of delaying the statement of a visit’s object. </p><p>They were given a cabinc in which to keep </p><p>their prisoner, who was an object of much </p><p>curiosity Until Basile spread the word that </p><p>Dick was not a Frenchman but a devil </p><p>from the other side of the stinking water. </p><p>And always Michel or Leon were on guard </p><p>at the hut. At night all three slept there. </p><p> “When do we begin?” demanded Leon</p><p>irritably the second night. “Let’s get this </p><p>over and be on our way.” </p><p> “Tomorrow,” answered Basile. “I will</p><p>hold a talk with the chiefs alone. By night </p><p>it should all be arranged.” </p><p> The next forenoon Michel and Leon re-</p><p>mained in the hut while Basile went to </p><p>confer with the leading men. The two </p><p>eoureurs de bois settled themselves com- </p><p>fortably for a long wait, for they knew the </p><p>deliberate habits of the savages in dis- </p><p>cussion. They were wholly unprepared, </p><p>therefore, when their leader returned in a </p><p>few minutes and thrust his head into the</p><p>low door. </p><p> “Settled so soon!” cried Leon. “Pom-</p><p>bert, you are capable of being prime minis- </p><p>ter to the king. Were they glad of the </p><p>chance to have our friend for the stake?” </p><p>“He’ll burn, and to the tune of the </p><p>shrieks of his yellow heart,” was the answer. </p><p>“But something bigger is afoot. Come and </p><p>I’ll tell you.” </p><p>CHAPTER VIII </p><p>BASILE GROWS AMBITIOUS </p><p>TAICK, alert for any opportunity but </p><p>helpless in the bonds with which he </p><p>was tied, glanced quickly about the bare </p><p>cabinc. It was the first time he had been </p><p>left alone and he looked for a forgotten </p><p>knife, hatchet, anything that might cut or </p><p>saw through the rawhide. </p><p> From outside he could hear the low tones</p><p>of Basile but he did not try to overhear. </p><p>Whatever this new plan of the Frenchman </p><p>it would be fiendish enough and now no </p><p>opportunity for escape must be overlooked. </p><p> Dick could see nothing of value to him</p><p>from where he lay. He rolled over so that </p><p>he might have a view of that part of the </p><p>cabine behind him, but the floor was bare </p><p>and nothing hung from the empty walls. </p><p>As he was about to roll back to his original </p><p>position something sharp pricked him on </p><p>one shoulder. </p><p> Hitching himself around, he began to feel</p><p>in the dry grass on which he had been lying. </p><p>His hands were bound closely to his sides </p><p>but he could move his numbed fingers </p><p>lightly—at last they struck a hard sub- </p><p>stance. His heart leaped at the first touch, </p><p>for instantly he recognized the object as a </p><p>flint arrow-head. He clutched it so tightly </p><p>one keen edge cut the skin between his </p><p>fingers. The pain brought a smile for the </p><p>worth of the tool was proved. Though it </p><p>caused torture he worked his fingers around </p><p>until he could slip the flint into the pocket </p><p>in his leggings and then, content, rolled </p><p>back to his original position. </p><p> For the first time he became conscious of</p><p>the voices outside the hut. Basile, greatly </p><p>excited, was talking more loudly, his </p><p>whispering tones penetrating farther than</p><p>had he spoken in his usual coarsened growl. </p><p> “Has not started to trade because he ex-</p><p>pects to Winter in the West,” Dick over- </p><p>heard. “His voyageurs deserted him and </p><p>he is trying to employ Mascoutens to man </p><p>his canoes.” </p><p>“Did you learn his name?” asked Leon. </p><p> “No, but from what the savages say</p><p>there is no doubt but that he is Antoine </p><p>Goddin.” </p><p>“A licensed trader, eh?” said Michel. </p><p> “And on his last journey!” exclaimed</p><p>Basile fiercely. “Next to this Englishman </p><p>there is none I hate more. It was three </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>IOI </p><p>years ago, in west of the Sault Ste. Marie, </p><p>among the Saulteurs, that he robbed me of </p><p>a year’s profits.” </p><p> “Is he the one who told the savages that</p><p>you were plundering them that he might get </p><p>the trade for himself?” asked Leon. </p><p> “The same. A sanctimonious wretch</p><p>who has the good will of the blackrobes, </p><p>talks of laws, boasts that he trades legally, </p><p>by the king’s sanction, and speaks of this </p><p>land as ‘the new Empire of France.’ I </p><p>swore that some day I would cross his trail, </p><p>and the day has come.” </p><p> “But there is risk in killing a French-</p><p>man,” objected Michel. “Savages do not </p><p>count.” </p><p> “Risk!” exclaimed Basile. “Have you,</p><p>too, absorbed the faint-heartedness of the </p><p>Englishman? Think, man! Never before </p><p>has a white man penetrated to this river. </p><p>None will come for years afterward, and are </p><p>not the Mascoutens known to be evil, de- </p><p>ceitful? Have not his voyageurs deserted </p><p>him, and will not that be known? Is he </p><p>not camped alone on the river? Does an </p><p>Indian hatchet leave a different mark when </p><p>swung by a white man? </p><p> “What if this licensed trader returns with</p><p>wealth. Do you not think more of his </p><p>breed will follow? Then what of us who </p><p>carry not the sanction of kings? We will </p><p>be driven out of this land that we have dis- </p><p>covered, out of the lands wherein our </p><p>profits lay. You sicken me, Michel, with </p><p>your tremors. But in any event he is </p><p>mine. I am to be avenged.” </p><p> “After that what plan?” asked Leon.</p><p> “We have a trading outfit, goods and</p><p>brandy. We will Winter to the north and </p><p>in the Spring we will be on our way to the </p><p>St. Lawrence with heavy canoes.” </p><p> “But the Englishman?”</p><p> “He will still pay the price, will still buy</p><p>us a canoeload of beaver skins. There is a </p><p>band of Hurons on Lac Mecheygan, driven </p><p>far from their homes by the Longhouses.</p><p>We will take this Englishman to them, tell </p><p>them he is Dutch, from the Dutch colony at </p><p>New Amsterdam, and they will give us </p><p>every skin in their village for him, for did </p><p>not the Dutch, and the English, too, fur- </p><p>nish the Longhouses with muskets and </p><p>powder?” </p><p> “A double haul!” cried Leon en-</p><p>thusiastically. </p><p> “Yes, and a double revenge for me,” re-</p><p>plied Basile venemously. “I have a mind </p><p>to stay and see the Hurons play with the </p><p>Englishman.” </p><p> “And when do we-” Michel hesitated.</p><p> “When do we brain this Goddin and take</p><p>his outfit?” sneered Basile. “I have a mind </p><p>to turn the Englishman over to the Mascou- </p><p>tens now if his presence among us fills you </p><p>with such qualms. Today we go on up the </p><p>river until we learn where he has his camp. </p><p>Then tonight! And we will be rich men </p><p>again.” </p><p> Basile hurried away to confer with the</p><p>chiefs of the village and Michel and Leon </p><p>entered the hut. They were silent and did </p><p>not look into the corner where Dick lay. </p><p>The Virginian, who had been bound so long </p><p>his legs and arms were becoming numb, </p><p>lifted his head. </p><p> “Michel,” he said, “there was a time when</p><p>we might have become fast friends. We </p><p>liked each other then and there should be </p><p>no cause for hard feelings now, no reason </p><p>why you can not grant me one small </p><p>favor.” </p><p> Michel looked at him but did not reply.</p><p>“This rawhide is drying and shrinking,” </p><p>Dick continued. “See how it is cutting </p><p>into my flesh. Already the feeling is gone. </p><p>Do me this one favor, Michel, and loosen </p><p>the bonds a little.” </p><p> “Leave them as they are,” advised Leon.</p><p>“And the savages will be cheated, and </p><p>you, too,” answered Dick. “Another day </p><p>and my legs and arms will be dead.” </p><p> “There is something in that, Leon,” said</p><p>Michel as he took a hesitating step toward </p><p>the prisoner. “See, the hide has cut into</p><p>his flesh. It will do no harm to loosen them. </p><p>Besides, he will always be in our sight.” </p><p>He crossed over and knelt beside Dick. </p><p>The green hide had stiffened and contracted </p><p>and it was with difficulty that he untied the </p><p>knots. As the blood rushed into his ex- </p><p>tremities Dick writhed and groaned from </p><p>the excruciating pain. His wrists and legs </p><p>were swollen and Michel, when he rebound </p><p>them, could not refrain from leaving the </p><p>thongs as loose as possible. </p><p> Faint from the pain but thankful that it</p><p>had not come when he had severed the </p><p>bonds himself, Dick lay back with his face </p><p>to the wall. In a short time, he knew, the </p><p>blood would be running in all his veins, the </p><p>numbness and swelling would almost dis- </p><p>appear, and when the time for his escape </p><p>came he would have the use of his arms and </p><p>legs. </p><p>102 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>DICK’S determination to escape </p><p>had grown twofold since he had </p><p>overheard Basile’s infamous plans. </p><p>Not only his own life but that of this un- </p><p>suspecting Frenchman was at stake and all </p><p>the repugnance and horror with which he </p><p>had watched the rape of the Islinois was </p><p>redoubled at the thought of Basile’s </p><p>treachery. Seeking freedom himself when </p><p>he had left Virginia, he was appalled at </p><p>this interpretation of it by the depraved </p><p>Pombert. </p><p> “We Start at once!” cried Basile as he</p><p>entered the cabine suddenly. “I have ex- </p><p>plained that we go to visit our countryman </p><p>and that we will return. Word has been </p><p>received that Goddin is no more than six </p><p>leagues up the river. We will start at once </p><p>so as to find his camp by dark.” </p><p> With the Mascoutens thronging about in</p><p>their curiosity over the spectacle of two </p><p>white men carrying another securly bound, </p><p>they went down to their canoe. Dick was </p><p>laid in the bottom and the Frenchmen </p><p>paddled off. </p><p> If Basile originally had intended to keep</p><p>his plans from Dicic by calling Leon and </p><p>Michel outside the cabine to discuss them, </p><p>he abandoned the idea once they were under </p><p>way. The man was exuberant, already </p><p>spending the gains of this new crime. He </p><p>found time, too, to taunt Dick, to describe </p><p>in detail what he intended to do when they </p><p>arrived at the camp of the licensed trader, </p><p>and the Virginian, though he lay quietly </p><p>with his eyes closed, resolved that nothing </p><p>could stand in the way of his liberty that he </p><p>might rid the earth of this evil spirit. </p><p> Leon and Michel, wholly lacking in moral</p><p>conception rather than instinctively crim- </p><p>inal, failed to respond to Basile’s mood. </p><p>They paddled steadily, their eyes always </p><p>searching the banks ahead for the camp of </p><p>the trader. But they went to their work </p><p>without enthusiasm, as if it were a dis- </p><p>agreeable task that must be done and then </p><p>forgotten. </p><p> Late in the afternoon they began to go</p><p>more slowly, reconnoitering from each bend, </p><p>becoming impatient when sunset ap-</p><p>proached. </p><p> “These cursed savages make a league to</p><p>their own liking,” complained Basile. “We </p><p>have gone eight leagues, not six, and still </p><p>there is no sign of him.” </p><p> “Be quiet,” whispered Michel from the</p><p>bow as he threw out his paddle and drew </p><p>the canoe backward and toward the bank. </p><p>“There is smoke ahead, around the next </p><p>bend.” </p><p> Silently they stepped ashore, leaving</p><p>Dick in the canoe, and crawled through the </p><p>brush along the bank to see if they had </p><p>reached their destination. While Dick was </p><p>still undecided whether he should cut his </p><p>bonds then or later they returned and im- </p><p>mediately began to discuss their plans. </p><p> “He’s on the other bank, less than a</p><p>quarter of a league away,” said Basile. </p><p>“Michel, slip through the brush up the </p><p>shore and find a place where you can watch </p><p>him. See if there is any one with him, how </p><p>many canoes are there, and how the land </p><p>lies behind his camp. Be back at dark.” </p><p> Dick was lifted from the canoe and Basile</p><p>with his hand in the Virginian’s collar, </p><p>dragged him up the bank and back into the </p><p>brush. The two then carried the canoe out </p><p>of sight and sat down to await Michel’s re- </p><p>port. </p><p> Basile, now that his revenge was near,</p><p>became exuberant. He recounted in de- </p><p>tail the wrongs for which he held Antoine </p><p>Goddin responsible, sneered at the circuitous </p><p>traits for which the trader was known, and </p><p>exultantly described how he would end his </p><p>life. </p><p> “If he is asleep I will waken him before I</p><p>strike, let him see who it is that is avenging </p><p>past wrongs,” he declared. </p><p> “You lie, Pombert!” exclaimed Dick.</p><p>“You are too much of a coward to strike a </p><p>man except in the back, and, by Heaven, if </p><p>these thongs were off my legs and arms I’d </p><p>prove it now.” </p><p> “Those thongs will stay there until the</p><p>Hurons, thinking you are a Dutch friend of </p><p>the Iroquois, bum them off,” taunted Ba-</p><p>sile. “And no more from you or I’ll give </p><p>you a taste of what the savages can do.” </p><p> “I well believe that you are capable of it,”</p><p>replied Dick. “I do not doubt but that it </p><p>is Longhouse blood itself that gives you that </p><p>swarthy countenance and that black heart.” </p><p> With a cry of rage Basile sprang to where</p><p>Dick lay. </p><p> “Beware, black heart,” the Virginian</p><p>warned in a low tone. “Touch me now and </p><p>my face will appear before you as you swing </p><p>your bloody hatchet tonight. Lay a hand, </p><p>on me now and after the stake I’ll follow </p><p>you wherever you go, and at last to the fire </p><p>that surely waits for you when the savages </p><p>catch their ravisher.” </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>103 </p><p> The Frenchman recoiled with a mumbled</p><p>oath and Dick laughed outright at this re- </p><p>sult of the curse he had placed upon the </p><p>other. </p><p> “Go back and boast some more, Pom-</p><p>bert,” he said. “It amuses me.” </p><p> Basile was strangely quiet until the re-</p><p>turn of Michel just at dusk with a report </p><p>that the trader was Goddin himself and </p><p>that he was alone in his camp, with two </p><p>large canoes drawn up on the bank and a </p><p>large cabine in which his goods undoubtedly </p><p>were stored. The trader had cooked his </p><p>supper and was smoking his evening pipe </p><p>when Michel left. </p><p> “Now,” began Basile eagerly, “to work!</p><p>We’ll take the canoe, cross the river, enter </p><p>the forest and come upon him from the rear. </p><p>He will be asleep soon, and remember that </p><p>it is I who am to enter his cabine. Tonight </p><p>men, tonight we will be rich! No one car- </p><p>ries a greater outfit out of the St. Lawrence </p><p>than this Goddin.” </p><p> “What of him while we are about this?”</p><p>asked Leon as he nodded toward the brush </p><p>where Dick lay. </p><p> “Let him lie until we return,” was the</p><p>command. “Look after his bonds, Michel, </p><p>and we will be off.” </p><p> Michel bent over Dick, felt of the thongs</p><p>about his ankles and those that bound his </p><p>arms to his sides and reported him secure. </p><p> “In a few minutes then,” said Basile, “it</p><p>will be dark and we will go.” </p><p> As he spoke Dick worked his fingers into</p><p>his pocket and grasped the piece of flint. </p><p>Not a second could be wasted. Time </p><p>spelled life both for Goddin and himself. </p><p>Not only must he reach the camp before the </p><p>others but he was under the added disad- </p><p>vantage of having to cross the river without </p><p>a canoe. </p><p>THE moment he heard the French- </p><p>men lift their canoe from the brush </p><p>he was busy with his flint. It was </p><p>difficult work for his hands were still slight-</p><p>ly numbed and he had to bend them at a </p><p>painful angle to reach a thong with his </p><p>flint. He had cut half-way through when </p><p>he was surprised by the sudden appearance </p><p>of Leon and Basile. </p><p> “We’ll make sure of him and tie him to</p><p>this tree,” said the leader as he grasped </p><p>Dick’s collar and heaved him farther into </p><p>the brush. “We’ll do it this way so that he </p><p>not only will be here when we return but </p><p>will get a little taste of what is coming to </p><p>him.” </p><p> As he talked he tied one end of a thong</p><p>around Dick’s ankles, passed it around the </p><p>tree and then beneath the captive’s arm- </p><p>pits. He turned Dick on his side with the </p><p>small of his back against the tree and then </p><p>drew the thong tight, hauling the feet and </p><p>shoulders around until Dick feared that his </p><p>back would be broken. </p><p> “Now we are certain,” said the French-</p><p>man as he gave the knot a final jerk. </p><p> A moment later Dick heard them step in-</p><p>to the canoe and in the silence that followed </p><p>he knew that they had gone. Immediately </p><p>he was at work with his flint. But now </p><p>his difficulties were increased as his right </p><p>hand, in which he held the arrow-head, was </p><p>wedged between his body and the tree. He </p><p>could, however, still reach a thong around </p><p>the waist, and to which his wrists were </p><p>bound, and painfully he began to cut it </p><p>through. </p><p> Twice before it snapped exhaustion</p><p>forced him to stop. But his first success </p><p>brought added determination and although </p><p>his position caused excruciating pain and </p><p>the perspiration poured from his face, he </p><p>continued frantically to saw at his bonds. </p><p> A half-hour went by and his hands were</p><p>not free though he had cut through the </p><p>thong in several places. From the plans of </p><p>the three, and the report of Michel con- </p><p>cerning the location of Goddin’s camp, he </p><p>might even then be too late. It occurred to </p><p>him to call, to shout as loudly as he could </p><p>with the hope that he might arouse the </p><p>trader and thereby put him on his guard. </p><p>As he strained to fill his lungs for the effort </p><p>the bonds about his waist loosened and his </p><p>hands fell away from his sides.</p><p> Exultantly he tugged until both wrists</p><p>were free and then, though the effort </p><p>brought torture to cramped muscles, he </p><p>lifted his right hand above his head and cut </p><p>the thong that held shoulders and heels to- </p><p>gether around the tree. The next instant </p><p>he was sitting up, freeing his legs of the </p><p>coils. </p><p> Dick’s one plan was to reach Goddin’s</p><p>camp in time to warn him. So great was </p><p>the urgency he was able to rise despite the </p><p>pain in every muscle, but when he attempt- </p><p>ed to walk he wondered vaguely why he </p><p>should suffer such torture for the sake of a </p><p>man he had never seen. But the remem- </p><p>brance of Basile’s evil face came to him and </p><p>104 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>he struggled on northward along the river </p><p>bank, teeth tightly clenched to prevent </p><p>his crying out at the agony each step </p><p>cost. </p><p> As he walked the pain became less and</p><p>when at last he saw the lighter spot against </p><p>the dark forest across the river and knew </p><p>he was opposite the trader’s tent he felt </p><p>able to swim the stream. He plunged in at </p><p>once, waded as far as he could, and then </p><p>struck out for the opposite shore. </p><p> The bank sloped up gradually from the</p><p>water to the door of the tent, or cabinc as </p><p>the French called it, which was set in the </p><p>center of a small opening in the forest. For </p><p>a moment Dick watched and listened and </p><p>then began to crawl forward on his hands </p><p>and knees. </p><p> “Stay where you are or I will shoot,”</p><p>came a low voice from the thick brush at his </p><p>left. </p><p> Dick’s first thought was that one of the</p><p>three Frenchmen had seen him and he was </p><p>about to run for cover when the even, cool </p><p>tone impressed itself upon him for the first </p><p>time. </p><p> “Monsieur Goddin,” he whispered. “Is</p><p>that you?” </p><p> “It is and I’ll shoot if you move. Lie</p><p>where you are.” </p><p> Dick saw a figure coming toward him</p><p>from the brush. </p><p> “Monsieur Goddin,” he whispered, “I am</p><p>a friend, though you never saw me. But </p><p>three Frenchmen are about to attack you </p><p>from the forest. Thank God I have been </p><p>in time.” </p><p> “You are an Englishman,” said Goddin.</p><p>“Your story is as strange as your presence., </p><p>in this country.” </p><p> “For your life, sir, do not speak above a</p><p>whisper,” implored Dick. “You can see </p><p>that I am unarmed. Go back to the </p><p>brush and i will follow and explain. But </p><p>pray make no noise.”</p><p> Goddin hesitated a moment and then</p><p>walked backward toward the place where </p><p>he had hidden. Dick crawled after him. </p><p> “Now,” said Goddin, who still kept his</p><p>musket aimed at Dick, “what is this non- </p><p>sense about three Frenchmen attacking a </p><p>countryman?” </p><p> “Do you know a eoureur de bois named</p><p>Basile Pombert?” Dick asked in reply. </p><p> “You have proven your words,” was the</p><p>quick answer in an entirely different tone. </p><p>“I need listen to no more except the details </p><p>of Pombert’s villainy. And I daresay that </p><p>those co-devils, Leon La Gard and Michel </p><p>Charon, are with him/’ </p><p> “They are,” answered Dick, “and all</p><p>three may be even now at the edge of this </p><p>clearing. They left me across the river, </p><p>below the next bend, securely tied, they be- </p><p>lieved, and paddled across and planned to </p><p>come upon you from the rear when you </p><p>were asleep.” </p><p> “Twice foiled,” laughed Goddin softly.</p><p>“There is a big swamp directly behind the </p><p>tent through which they are probably </p><p>floundering, and you will notice yourself, </p><p>monsieur, that I was not asleep in my tent. </p><p>Does Pombert take me for a fool to sleep so </p><p>when I am alone among strange savages? </p><p>My bed was here and you wakened me. </p><p>They would have done the same.” </p><p> “Then,” Dick began.</p><p> “Not a mite less thanks to you, monsieur,</p><p>and I will show that Antoine Goddin never </p><p>forgets a favor, or the reverse. But all that </p><p>may wait until tomorrow. Now we will </p><p>plan to rid New France of this Pombert and </p><p>thereby merit the respect of all honest men. </p><p>The others are only tools of his and will </p><p>stand or fall as the battle swings. Listen! </p><p>I heard a broken twig.” </p><p>CHAPTER IX </p><p>THE MEDICINE MAN </p><p> LISTEN, monsieur,” whispered Dick</p><p>J when he and Goddin were safely </p><p>hidden in the bushes. “I placed a curse</p><p>on Pombert today, not that I believe in it </p><p>but because I knew that he would, and I was </p><p>not sure that I would free myself and warn </p><p>you in time. I told him that when he </p><p>struck your sleeping figure with his hatchet </p><p>my face would appear before him.” </p><p> “There is only a roll of blankets for him</p><p>to murder in the tent,” answered the </p><p>Frenchman. “A shot from my musket </p><p>at this distance is ample.” </p><p> “But Pombert is mine. I told him</p><p>I would kill him some day.” </p><p> “It is not well to hate so, my friend.”</p><p> “It is not hate. It is a loathing, like a</p><p>man has for a snake. Pombert is an evil </p><p>thing, a vile thing, and there is no murder </p><p>in lulling him. Besides, I still feel that </p><p>green thong tightening into my flesh.” </p><p>Goddin laughed. </p><p> “You have hardly proved your point,</p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>105 </p><p>monsieur, but you have the desire, and he </p><p>is yours. Here is my musket.” </p><p> “No, a hatchet is what I want, what he</p><p>deserves. And I’ll be waiting for him in </p><p>the tent. He will see my face when he is </p><p>ready to strike.” </p><p> Goddin handed the Virginian a small ax</p><p>that he had placed in his nest in the brush </p><p>and instantly Dick was worming his way </p><p>forward in the grass. The Frenchman </p><p>looked, saw him start, and then nothing </p><p>moved in the darkness. </p><p> “I did not know an Englishman had</p><p>blood so warm,” he mused. “But he is a </p><p>man, and I think a man after my own </p><p>liking.” </p><p> Goddin did not have long to wait. It</p><p>was too dark for him to see a figure against </p><p>the thick foliage behind the camp but he </p><p>could distinguish a shadow between him </p><p>and the white tent. It flitted across, </p><p>silently, quickly, and he knew Pombert </p><p>had come. </p><p> Dick, in the manner he had learned from</p><p>the Indian boys in his youth, had gained </p><p>the tent without the possibility of being </p><p>seen from the thicket behind it. The </p><p>grass was long and his movements so silent </p><p>a snake could not have done it more </p><p>quietly. He slipped in under the flap </p><p>almost on top of the bed Antoine Goddin </p><p>had arranged for just such an emergency. </p><p>Behind it, piled to the peak, were bales of </p><p>goods. Against these Dick leaned, waiting, </p><p>his hatchet ready. </p><p> There was a faint sound beside the tent,</p><p>a pause, then further movement. In a </p><p>moment the tent flap began to move back </p><p>and Dick heard the rustle of a body rubbing </p><p>against the canvas. The triangle of black- </p><p>ness lost its clear-cut shape and a dark </p><p>figure arose, one arm lifted. </p><p> “Beware, Pombert!” Dick warned in</p><p>sepulchral tones. </p><p> A shriek that seemed to rip open the tent</p><p>burst from the Frenchman’s throat. He </p><p>staggered back, helpless in his terror.</p><p> “Come, craven,” Dick said sharply.</p><p>“Lift your hand to strike. I could not even </p><p>kill a snake that runs.” </p><p> The words had their desired effect. With</p><p>a second cry, now of rage, Basile sprang </p><p>forward, a knife uplifted. His every move- </p><p>ment was silhouetted against the white tent </p><p>while the Virginian’s position could be </p><p>distinguished only by his voice. Dick </p><p>stepped to one side and the head of his </p><p>hatchet crushed into Pombert’s skull. </p><p>Without a sound the Frenchman collapsed. </p><p>He had hardly touched the ground before </p><p>Dick had gripped his collar and dragged </p><p>him outside. </p><p> As he stood there, about to call to Goddin,</p><p>the crashing of brush in the forest behind </p><p>the camp told him of the presence of the </p><p>others. </p><p> “Leon!” he cried. “Michel! Come and</p><p>get the carrion!” </p><p> The crashing only grew louder and Dick</p><p>laughed. </p><p> “Come, Monsieur Goddin,” he called in</p><p>a loud voice. “We live in a safer world.” </p><p>The Frenchman ran swiftly across the </p><p>clear ring. </p><p> “Monsieur,” he said solemnly as he saw</p><p>the body lying at Dick’s feet, “I and all </p><p>honest men owe you their thanks. It is a </p><p>strange thing that liberty appears in such </p><p>various guises. To Pombert it meant a </p><p>chance to rob, to plunder, to kill, and to </p><p>escape punishment. Thank God that same </p><p>freedom attracts men who think and see </p><p>in straight lines, for no finer land ever lay </p><p>beneath the sun than that in which we are, </p><p>monsieur, and it must be saved for those </p><p>who will not abuse it.” </p><p> “Who are you?” demanded Dick curi-</p><p>ously, “to speak and think in this manner?” </p><p>“A coureur lie bois, monsieur.” </p><p> “But he?” and Dick touched Pombert’s</p><p>body with his foot. </p><p> “Also a ranger of the forests, and one of</p><p>too many who are giving us the name of </p><p>thieves and ravishers, of licentious outlaws,</p><p>of deiilers of a simple people and a fair land. </p><p>But we are not all thus, as you shall leam </p><p>if you stay in this country. To be a forest </p><p>runner does not always mean to be a thief. </p><p> “But what of you, monsieur? You must</p><p>pardon my curiosity, but an Englishman in </p><p>a land where Englishmen have never been, </p><p>of which they do not even know, and a man </p><p>of your character in company with Basile </p><p>Pombert—you can see that the whole is very </p><p>strange.” </p><p> “But there is nothing strange in my</p><p>story,” replied Dick, “and I will tell it to </p><p>you. But first let us rid ourselves of what </p><p>remains of Pombert. He was made in </p><p>God’s image even if wholly devoid ot </p><p>his precepts. I would not like to think </p><p>that wild beasts devoured even the body of </p><p>such a man.” </p><p> “We will carry it into the brush and cover</p><p>io6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>it with a blanket,” said Goddin. “In the </p><p>morning there will be light, and now you </p><p>need a lire for you are wet.” </p><p>THEY carried the body away from </p><p>the tent and built a fire, for they </p><p>had no fear of Leon and Michel. </p><p>While Dick warmed and dried himself he </p><p>gave his history, beginning as he had done </p><p>on the Des Plaines River with his boyhood, </p><p>his wanderings, his encounter with Sir </p><p>William Berkeley, his escape from Virginia, </p><p>his hazardous journey down the Ohio, </p><p>his discovery of Lac Mecheygan and his </p><p>finding the coureurs de bois. </p><p> Throughout the recital Dick spoke lightly,</p><p>recounting his conversation with Sir Wil- </p><p>liam in detail because he still laughed over </p><p>it himself. </p><p> “My faith, monsieur!” Goddin exclaimed</p><p>after his hearty laughter had interrupted </p><p>the tale. “You have the spirit of the </p><p>French, the Latin lightness of humor. I </p><p>did not know that Englishmen could even </p><p>appreciate satire. They have always been </p><p>pictured to me as slow of wit and inclined </p><p>to be morose.” </p><p> “Perhaps I am not an Englishman,”</p><p>replied Dick seriously. “How long have </p><p>you lived in this land beyond the Western </p><p>ocean?” </p><p> “Twenty years and more.”</p><p> “And I was born in it. Do you not think,</p><p>monsieur, that birth in such a land as this, </p><p>or a long life in it, instils something in the </p><p>heart that is entirely different from that of </p><p>the man in Europe?” </p><p> “I am sure of it,” was the answer. “I</p><p>have often thought so. It has already </p><p>begun. Your own Pilgrims to the Plym- </p><p>outh country, the Huguenots from mine </p><p>own France who settled in La Floride only </p><p>to perish, they are the straws. But what </p><p>led to your trouble with Pombert?” </p><p> Dick told of the pillaging of the Islinois,</p><p>of the flight and of Pombert’s attempt to </p><p>obtain revenge and to recoup by giving him </p><p>to the Indians as a prisoner.</p><p> “I feel,” said Goddin solemnly, “that</p><p>you have twice saved my life, my friend. </p><p>I was on my way to the country of the </p><p>Islinois, of whom I had heard. Now it </p><p>would be folly to go on. The story of </p><p>Pombert’s treachery will spread far and </p><p>it will ill fare a Frenchman who ventures </p><p>among them. Now I must return to the </p><p>country south of Lac Superior, on the waters </p><p>of the Miscousing, or Ouisconsin, as it is </p><p>called, where I have Wintered before. I </p><p>had hoped to return with bales of the skins </p><p>of wild cattle, of which I have heard, but </p><p>now will take beaver instead. What are </p><p>your plans?” </p><p> “Plans!” laughed Dick. “Where have</p><p>I had time for planning? I had hoped to </p><p>find the French and lead the life of the </p><p>coureurs de bois. After what I saw of the </p><p>methods of Pombert I knew it was im- </p><p>possible.” </p><p> “Would you come with me as voyageur?</p><p>I am without men, and your profits, you </p><p>know, are fixed by law. The voyageurs </p><p>receive half after all expenses are paid and </p><p>divide it among themselves.” </p><p> “I will do so gladly,” replied Dick</p><p>eagerly, “but only on condition that I go </p><p>as your friend. It is not that I would </p><p>escape the labor. You are welcome to all </p><p>I have. But I would not earn so generous </p><p>a share after half the journey has been </p><p>made.” </p><p> “I would be glad to have you with me</p><p>as a friend,” said Goddin warmly, “and </p><p>the profits will be settled to your satisfac- </p><p>tion. I am expecting four Indians in the </p><p>morning to help me with the canoes and </p><p>the goods. I had made arrangements for </p><p>them to go south but they will more </p><p>willingly go north. Come and share my </p><p>bed, for you must be tired.” </p><p> There began for the young Virginian the</p><p>life of which he had dreamed. The pleas- </p><p>ant Summer waned and the wonderful Fall </p><p>came, and always they traveled northward. </p><p>Large lakes and little rivers that flowed </p><p>sluggishly or tumbled over rocks, creeks </p><p>too small for paddling the heavily-loaded </p><p>canoes, portages in swamp, forest and </p><p>prairie, each was traversed, and each began</p><p>to signify to Dick a new link in the friend- </p><p>ship which bound Goddin and himself. </p><p> Here was no villainy, no plan for plunder</p><p>or murder, no thought of a quick dash into </p><p>a new country to despoil and leave a trail </p><p>of rape and poisoned passion. Here was </p><p>no desire to abuse what seemed nothing </p><p>less than a Heaven-granted privilege, the </p><p>right to’wander at will through this won- </p><p>derfully fertile country, to live in the </p><p>tranquility of that peace which only the </p><p>wide places know. </p><p> As they traveled on and on, crossing</p><p>from one watercourse to another, watching </p><p>the character of the land change constantly </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>107 </p><p>and yet always remain fair, Dick began to </p><p>question as to its extent. </p><p> “No man knows,” was Goddin’s answer.</p><p>“It is my desire to find out some day, to </p><p>go on and on into the west until I come to </p><p>the sea. It was this desire that first sent </p><p>me into the country around the uppermost </p><p>of these great lakes, and according to my </p><p>calculations and plans another year or two </p><p>should see me on my way.” </p><p> “To the South Sea, the Gulf of Cali-</p><p>fornia?” asked Dick eagerly. </p><p> “I often doubt if that is what I will find,”</p><p>said Goddin. “For ten years now I have </p><p>traded in the district around Michili- </p><p>makinac. I have talked with Saulteurs </p><p>from beyond Lac Superior, with the Hurons </p><p>and Outaouas, Ouinibegous, Outagamis, </p><p>Mascoutens, Renards, Sakis and even with </p><p>the Nadouaissioux, who live farther to </p><p>the west than any tribe white men have </p><p>ever seen. I have listened to eoureurs de </p><p>bois who have been in places of which they </p><p>dare not speak when they return to the </p><p>St. Lawrence, and I have questioned other </p><p>forest rangers, like Nicholas Perrot, Raddi- </p><p>son and Groseilliers, and with Jesuits who </p><p>are always seeking new pagan peoples, and </p><p>all these are men who do speak of the places </p><p>they have seen. </p><p> “If you believe all that you hear you</p><p>would go mad. I think it is the white man, </p><p>and the white man’s hope, that has given </p><p>rise to the story of the Red Sea being near </p><p>us, that and the savage legends of stinking </p><p>water, by which they mean salt. My own </p><p>opinion, based upon reports from all sources </p><p>and arrived at after much weighing and </p><p>sifting and balancing, is that we are still </p><p>a long way from the Gulf of California. </p><p> “The ‘great water,’ the Misisepe, of</p><p>which the savages speak, is only a river </p><p>I feel certain, but a large river like the St. </p><p>Lawrence and flowing through an immense </p><p>country. Great streams come in from the </p><p>west and I believe one could travel almost </p><p>a thousand leagues and still fail to reach </p><p>the Eastern ocean, the way to the Indies. </p><p> “The white man hopes for the South Sea</p><p>and pearls and gold. He grasps eagerly </p><p>at tales of great water and strange people, </p><p>forgetting that the savage is fearful of </p><p>unknown lands and prone to believe in </p><p>monsters and unnatural things. I have </p><p>even talked with savages who, I am certain, </p><p>have been on the Misisepe, and within two </p><p>years I expect to be there myself. The </p><p>cost of such an expedition is great, but </p><p>I have been saving and after another visit </p><p>to Montreal I will start.” </p><p>THEY spoke often of this “great </p><p>water” and of what might He </p><p>beyond it. Dick was continually </p><p>amazed by the extent of Goddin’s travels, </p><p>his knowledge of the various savage nations </p><p>and the districts they claimed as their own. </p><p>The Frenchman was generous with his </p><p>information and the young Virginian, </p><p>finding romance in every word, absorbed </p><p>it to the last detail. He learned, too, the </p><p>names and histories of many Frenchmen, </p><p>eoureurs de bois, men who had traveled far, </p><p>endured much, only to fail to receive recog- </p><p>nition from France for all their efforts. </p><p> “It is a strange thing that sends men</p><p>into unknown places,” said Goddin one </p><p>night. “But since the world began I </p><p>imagine men have done it. They risk </p><p>their lives, everything, endure incredible </p><p>hardships, and they die only with the </p><p>satisfaction that they were first of their </p><p>race in some part of the world. You have </p><p>the soul of an explorer, Monsieur Dick. </p><p>Why do you not join me in this journey </p><p>I have planned. Perhaps we might dis- </p><p>cover this ‘great water,’ learn a little of the </p><p>land beyond.” </p><p> The words brought a smile to Dick’s eyes</p><p>which he could not conceal and Goddin, </p><p>seeing his mirth, angry, hurt, stared at him </p><p>in silence. </p><p> “Pardon me, monsieur,” the Virginian</p><p>begged contritely. “My sense of humor </p><p>is ever ready to give offense. But there </p><p>is some cause for laughter. I scorned the </p><p>chance, even to save my neck from the </p><p>noose, to find this land for one king. Now, </p><p>after all my adventures in a quest for </p><p>freedom, you ask me to help find it for </p><p>another. Sir William Berkeley promised </p><p>me honor to serve King Charles, to take </p><p>in his name a land he would never see, and</p><p>you ask me to do the same for still another </p><p>who believes that God gave him the right </p><p>to persecute honest men. Think you then </p><p>that there can be no kingless land?” </p><p> “Do you remember your asking me if I</p><p>believed that this land and the air above it </p><p>instil something in the heart of a man </p><p>which is unknown in Europe?” asked </p><p>Goddin in answer. “I do believe that, and </p><p>I believe that some day this land will be </p><p>filled with people of the white race and </p><p>io8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>that they will rule themselves. Perhaps </p><p>it is only a dream, perhaps I brood too </p><p>much when alone in the forest, but perhaps </p><p>I do see the significance of events in Europe </p><p>and therg is a basis for my belief in the </p><p>growing power of the people to think for </p><p>themselves. Yet, despite even reason, I </p><p>can not help but feel that this land you </p><p>and I have seen can never come under the </p><p>rule of a tyrant. </p><p> “Many times when I have looked over</p><p>the broad valleys, have dug my toe into </p><p>the fertile soil, have traveled so far and so </p><p>easily on the great waterways, I have in </p><p>my imagination seen farms and villages </p><p>and cities filled with a happy, contented, </p><p>prosperous people. I have said this to </p><p>others, once to Perrot, and have been </p><p>laughed at. </p><p> “ ‘What?’ Perrot exclaimed. ‘This sav-</p><p>age land another France! A plow in these </p><p>prairies! Ships on these great lakes! An- </p><p>toine, you are a dreamer! This is a fur </p><p>land and will remain so. It is'too far and, </p><p>besides, there are not people enough in all </p><p>the world to fill a corner of it. It’s fur we </p><p>seek here and all we will ever find, and for </p><p>that we should be thankful.’ </p><p> “I didn’t say so to him but I see the fur</p><p>trade as the opening wedge only, some- </p><p>thing that will serve its purpose and be </p><p>gone. That is why I am content to follow </p><p>it, if by doing so I will add my mite to </p><p>making the land known.” </p><p> “But you have not answered my ob-</p><p>jections to finding this land in the name of </p><p>a king,” protested Dick. </p><p> “I was only leading up to it. You saw</p><p>Pombert’s idea of liberty. You must </p><p>admit that even a king’s is better. To me </p><p>a king is only a symbol for the people he </p><p>rules, and in time I believe that all kings, </p><p>if they exist at all, will be only symbols </p><p>of what holds the people together and gives </p><p>them safety and happiness. If I found </p><p>this ‘great water,’ this Misisepe, I would </p><p>take it in the name of my king to make </p><p>my act legal, but in reality I would know </p><p>that I was taking it in the name of my race, </p><p>my nation, the people of whom I am one,</p><p>and that in time it would be theirs.” </p><p> This was a new idea for Dick and he</p><p>received Goddin’s words in an unusually </p><p>thoughtful silence. The older man, sensing </p><p>the impression he had made, content to </p><p>plant only the seeds in Dick’s fertile mind, </p><p>changed the subject to one lying more near </p><p>their every-day life. It was not, however, </p><p>the last discussion on this topic. Again </p><p>and again it cropped up in their long talks </p><p>before the camp-fire in the evenings. And </p><p>always, though Dick said little, the French- </p><p>man felt more and more certain that when </p><p>the time came to do that for which he had </p><p>waited he would not go alone. </p><p> Goddin was by no means always serious</p><p>and in Dick’s exuberant spirits as well as </p><p>in his freedom from accepted beliefs he </p><p>found a constant source of delight. He </p><p>recognized, too, the romantic nature of the </p><p>Virginian and recounted many adventures, </p><p>described many scenes in strange places, </p><p>and unfolded a wealth of information con- </p><p>cerning the many savage nations which </p><p>lived in the neighborhood of the great lakes. </p><p> In. the early Fall they reached a place</p><p>far up the Ouisconsin River where Goddin </p><p>had Wintered two years before and where </p><p>beaver skins were plentiful and of ex- </p><p>ceptional quality. The four Indians re- </p><p>turned to their own country and the two </p><p>white men repaired the cabines Goddin had </p><p>used before, moved the trade-goods into </p><p>one and made the other comfortable for </p><p>living-quarters. </p><p> The Winter was a busy one and, for Dick,</p><p>passed quickly. The savages seemed to </p><p>learn miraculously that they had come and </p><p>flocked to the post. Later when the snows </p><p>were deep Goddin and Dick made journeys </p><p>to their camps. Always they obtained fur </p><p>on these trips and weekly Dick saw the pile </p><p>of goods diminish and the bales of pelts </p><p>increase. </p><p> It was well that the two worked at their</p><p>fur-gathering in the early Winter, for with </p><p>the approach of Spring came the usual </p><p>famine season. And with it came a change </p><p>in the industry of the savages, the fur trade </p><p>stopping as suddenly as if it had been cut </p><p>off with a knife. Goddin, knowing that </p><p>their work in the district was finished,</p><p>made plans to go down-river as soon as the </p><p>ice would permit, and the fur was baled </p><p>for the journey. </p><p> Daily the famine grew worse. Dick</p><p>found one camp wiped out by starvation. </p><p>Hunters brought their families and crowded </p><p>around the post begging for food. Goddin, </p><p>though his own supplies were low and he </p><p>and Dick were living mostly on what little </p><p>game they were able to kill, gave what he </p><p>could. Even in the face of possible want </p><p>for themselves the Frenchman could not </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>109 </p><p>refrain from giving food to the women and </p><p>children who hung about his door, though </p><p>he was severe enough in denouncing the </p><p>men for not hunting and daily drove them </p><p>out in search of game. </p><p>H AMONG the Ouinibegous who </p><p>sought Goddin’s charity was a </p><p>medicine-man who had gained suffi- </p><p>cient prestige in his band to abandon hunt- </p><p>ing and live off the proceeds of his magic </p><p>arts. Once Goddin caught him taking </p><p>food he had just given to a child and drove </p><p>him off with a club. </p><p> Sickness followed hard on the heels of</p><p>famine and there were several deaths. The </p><p>medicine-man’s services were in demand, </p><p>but as his patients died he became more </p><p>and more bitter toward the white men, </p><p>denouncing them as the cause of his failures </p><p>to cure and openly insolent when he </p><p>encountered Goddin alone. </p><p> One family, the first to arrive at the post,</p><p>had been particularly troublesome. The </p><p>father was too lazy to hunt and upon the </p><p>mother fell the work of providing for the </p><p>three children. Her bravery in the face </p><p>of her difficulties, her refusal to complain, </p><p>the ceaseless efforts she made to snare birds </p><p>and hares, her self-denial and her affection </p><p>for her children, had aroused the sympathy </p><p>and admiration of Dick and Goddin and </p><p>she was helped more generously than any </p><p>of the others. </p><p> She never begged until one day when</p><p>the snow had nearly gone and the ice was </p><p>breaking in the river. She brought to the </p><p>cabin her youngest child. Its wasted little </p><p>body was wrapped in a filthy deerskin </p><p>and when she threw this back the white </p><p>men recoiled with exclamations of horror. </p><p>The entire body of the child was covered </p><p>with large ulcerated sores. </p><p> “Have you no medicines?” asked Dick.</p><p> “I have an ointment for troubles of the</p><p>skin and I’ll use it!” exclaimed Goddin </p><p>fiercely. “It is folly to meddle with such </p><p>things. The Jesuits have aroused much </p><p>resentment by preaching against the medi- </p><p>cine-man. It can only lead to trouble.</p><p>But we can’t abandon this woman now. </p><p>She has been brave and she has done </p><p>everything possible to keep her family </p><p>alive. We can’t desert her, Dick. I’ll </p><p>give her the ointment to apply.” </p><p> The woman went away, her eyes alone</p><p>expressing her thankfulness, and a few </p><p>minutes later when Goddin found her </p><p>husband on the river bank, sprawled out </p><p>in the welcome sun, he chased him into the </p><p>forest with a club. </p><p> “The dog lies there while she eats out</p><p>her own heart!” he stormed to Dick as </p><p>they sat down to dinner. “It is folly to do </p><p>this, to interfere with them, for they believe </p><p>that the)- are right in all things and secretly </p><p>laugh at our methods, though they are </p><p>anxious enough to have our steel and goods. </p><p>But we will be leaving in a few days now </p><p>and I’m willing to have taken the risk.” </p><p> The Frenchman, anxious to start down</p><p>the river with the first breaking of the ice, </p><p>had completed his preparations in the first </p><p>of April. The fur was baled, the canoes </p><p>had been made ready, six Ouinibegous had </p><p>been engaged to man them as far as Michili- </p><p>makinac and the maize and wild oats which </p><p>had been saved for the journey were </p><p>sacked. </p><p> Two days after the Indian woman had</p><p>been given the ointment the two white </p><p>men stood on the bank of the river watching </p><p>the ice grind down stream. The warm sun </p><p>was welcomed on their backs, little rivulets </p><p>of water flowed into the larger stream, some </p><p>trees were beginning to open their buds. </p><p> “Tomorrow is the day,” said Goddin.</p><p>“By tonight the river will be free of ice and </p><p>by the time we reach the portage into the </p><p>river that will take us to Lac Mecheygan </p><p>the water will be so high we can paddle </p><p>across and escape the carry of nearly half a </p><p>league. Run up the river to where the </p><p>savages are camped, my friend, and tell </p><p>the men we have engaged to be here tonight. </p><p>Then we can start early in the morning.” </p><p> Dick took his musket, for a buck or even</p><p>a bird was welcome, and entered the forest. </p><p>A half-lcague up the river the savages had </p><p>gathered at a rapids that they might catch </p><p>the first fish of the Spring run, but when</p><p>Dick reached their village he found the men </p><p>squatting in the sun before the cabines </p><p>while the women were equally idle. </p><p> The sullen silence with which he was</p><p>greeted instantly acquainted Dick with the </p><p>fact that something was wrong. His sum- </p><p>mons to the men Goddin had engaged was </p><p>received without comment. As he stood </p><p>there staring about liim, wondering at this </p><p>sudden change in the attitude of the savages </p><p>toward bun, the death wail arose from the </p><p>last cabine of the row along the river bank. </p><p>The shrieks echoed up and down the </p><p>no </p><p>Adventure </p><p>stream and women all about him joined in </p><p>the shrill, moaning cry until Dick was forced </p><p>to stop his ears. </p><p> “Who is dead?” he asked of an old man</p><p>who had always been friendly. </p><p> The savage growled an unintelligible</p><p>reply and turned his back. </p><p> At a loss to explain this unfriendliness</p><p>of a people who had fawned about him in </p><p>their desire for food only the week before, </p><p>Dick walked out of the village and sought </p><p>the trail to the post. Once or twice he </p><p>glanced back uneasily. </p><p> “Who cares if the beggars are unfriendly</p><p>now that the fish are beginning to fill their </p><p>miserable stomachs,” he muttered as he </p><p>walked swiftly down the trail. “We will </p><p>be gone tomorrow.” </p><p> A low hiss from the brush beside him</p><p>brought a quick halt and he turned to see </p><p>an old Indian looking out from behind a </p><p>giant pine. </p><p> “Hurry back,” whispered the man, whom</p><p>Dick recognized as an Islinois the Ouini- </p><p>begous had taken prisoner and kept as a </p><p>slave. “The child for whom the French- </p><p>man made medicine has died. The medi- </p><p>cine-man of the band has claimed that the </p><p>white men’s medicine kitled him. He and </p><p>the child’s father are even now on the way </p><p>to the white men’s cabine. Their minds </p><p>are evil and they carry the white men’s </p><p>arrows. If you would arrive in time to save </p><p>the bearded white man, do not wait. Get </p><p>into the canoes and flee, for the medicine- </p><p>man has stirred up all the people against </p><p>you.” </p><p> Before the man had finished Dick was</p><p>running down the trail. He realized in- </p><p>stantly what lay back of his reception at </p><p>the village and he had learned enough </p><p>of the treacherous nature of the Ouini- </p><p>begous to recognize the danger to Goddin. </p><p>It would not be an open attack. Neither </p><p>the medicine-man nor the lazy father of </p><p>the dead child would dare. It would be a </p><p>stealthy stalk in the shelter of the bushes </p><p>behind the cabine, a musket fired so close</p><p>there would be no chance of missing. </p><p> His heart chilled by the fear that he</p><p>would be too late to save his friend, Dick </p><p>ran as he had never run before. He forgot </p><p>the heavy musket in his hand, splashed </p><p>heedlessly through water and swamp and </p><p>melting snow, leaped over fallen trees and </p><p>dashed the brush aside. </p><p> Breathless, he came at last to the clearing</p><p>in which the two rojigh log buildings stood. </p><p>It was empty of any living tiling, and Dick, </p><p>hysterical in his thankfulness, stopping to </p><p>gulp the air into his bursting lungs, began </p><p>to search the brush around the edge for a </p><p>lurking figure. </p><p> As he looked Goddin stepped out through</p><p>the door. In the same instant that the </p><p>warning cry sprang to Dick’s lips a musket </p><p>roared and the Frenchman swayed, clutched </p><p>at his breast and then fell at full length. </p><p>CHAPTER X </p><p>ALONE </p><p>T'XICK JEFFREYS, sickened, nerveless, </p><p>*-• stunned by the horror of this unthink- </p><p>able crime, benumbed by the loss of his </p><p>friend, stared across the clearing as if he </p><p>were looking at something unreal, as if he </p><p>were still in the grip of a horrible nightmare. </p><p>He did not move, could not, until a black </p><p>head appeared from behind a clump of </p><p>bushes. </p><p> The sight brought instant action and he</p><p>dashed into the open, straight toward the </p><p>ambush from which Goddin had been </p><p>slaughtered. So quick was his rush, so </p><p>swiftly did rage spur him on, he had passed </p><p>the cabines before the murderers had gained </p><p>their feet to flee. One fired a musket </p><p>wildly and then dropped it. His back was </p><p>hardly turned before Dick was upon him, </p><p>and the Virginian’s heavy weapon crashed </p><p>.down through his skull. </p><p> The second savage, the father of the</p><p>dead child, the one whose musket was </p><p>empty and therefore who had actually </p><p>fired the shot which had killed Goddin, </p><p>dodged from tree to tree, but he had not </p><p>run twenty yards before a ball struck him </p><p>scjuarelv in the middle of the back.</p><p> Still raging, hysterical, sobbing, his brain</p><p>in a tumult, Dick turned back to the clear- </p><p>ing. Fearful now in the presence of </p><p>death, hesitating as he was about to look </p><p>into the white face of the man he had </p><p>grown to love, he approached Goddin’s </p><p>body slowly. When only a few paces away </p><p>there was a slight twitch in one of the </p><p>Frenchman’s legs and with a glad cry the </p><p>Virginian sprang forward and turned his </p><p>friend over. </p><p> “Antoine!” he cried. “Open your eyes!</p><p>You can not—you must not die!” </p><p> Eagerly he thrust his hand inside</p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>hi </p><p>Goddin’s shirt. The heart was still beat- </p><p>ing. </p><p> And then through his loneliness and</p><p>despair for his friend and his rage against </p><p>the savages who had brought this sorrow </p><p>to him another fact impressed itself. </p><p>Instantly he leaped to his feet. </p><p> Over the forest had descended a sudden</p><p>hush. There was no sound except the </p><p>occasional lazy grinding of a laggard ice </p><p>cake against the shore. Dick realized for </p><p>the first time that throughout his run </p><p>down the river from the Indian village, </p><p>while he stood at the edge of the clearing, </p><p>even while the savage’s musket roared and </p><p>Antoine fell, the death wail had been echo- </p><p>ing up and down the valley. Now all was </p><p>still. </p><p> Dick stood looking up the river. The</p><p>village was around a bend but he knew </p><p>instinctively what was transpiring there. </p><p>The women had ceased their wailing, but </p><p>in another moment the war-cry would take </p><p>its place. The musket shots had been </p><p>heard. The medicine-man and his dupe </p><p>would not return. Inside of an hour thirty </p><p>men would be at his heels. </p><p> Instantly he decided upon the only</p><p>possible course. He stooped over Goddin </p><p>just as the Frenchman opened his eyes. </p><p> “Thank God!” whispered Dick. “I must</p><p>carry you to the canoe. Tell me if it hurts </p><p>too much, but bear as much as you can, </p><p>my friend. The savages will be here in an </p><p>hour and we must be downstream as far </p><p>as possible.” </p><p> Dick slipped his arms gently beneath</p><p>Goddin’s body and staggered to his feet. </p><p>A canoe was drawn partly out of the water </p><p>and in this he laid his burden. Imme- </p><p>diately he was running back to the cabine, </p><p>to return with powder-horns, bullet pouches, </p><p>an ax, blankets and several other articles </p><p>that first met his eyes. He dumped these </p><p>into the bow and ran back for corn, wild </p><p>oats, a kettle and whatever else he could </p><p>lay his hands on. With an ax he crushed </p><p>in the sides of the remaining craft and five </p><p>minutes after he had lifted Goddin their</p><p>canoe was afloat and turned downstream. </p><p> For half an hour Dick paddled with all</p><p>his skill and strength. He wanted to get </p><p>as far away as possible before the pursuit </p><p>started because he knew that he must stop </p><p>soon to dress Goddin’s wounds. A long, </p><p>straight stretch of water a league below </p><p>the post offered the opportunity he desired </p><p>and when he reached the lower end of it </p><p>he turned ashore at a point where he could </p><p>command his back trail for a long distance. </p><p> As he stepped out and examined the</p><p>wounded man he felt suddenly numb, </p><p>suddenly alone in the vast, savage-peopled </p><p>wilderness. That there could be no hope </p><p>he recognized instantly, and yet because the </p><p>bond between them was so strong Dick </p><p>would not admit his despair. The bullet </p><p>had smashed Goddin’s right arm above the </p><p>elbow and then entered his right lung, </p><p>perhaps the left, for it had not passed out </p><p>on the other side. In the bottom of the </p><p>canoe was a pool of blood, and the injured </p><p>man’s beard was crimson. </p><p> Dick cut off the sleeve of the jacket and</p><p>bound up the arm as best he could. The </p><p>hole in the side was more difficult and every </p><p>time he moved the body blood gushed out. </p><p>He completed the task only partly to his </p><p>satisfaction and as he finished Goddin again </p><p>regained consciousness. </p><p> “It is bad,” he whispered as his eyes</p><p>met Dick’s. </p><p> “Not at all,” was the instant reply.</p><p>“Nothing that will keep you on your back </p><p>more than a few days.” </p><p> “I knew you would say that, Dick, but</p><p>I know what has happened. If I were in </p><p>Montreal with the best surgeon in New </p><p>France at hand, I could not live.” </p><p> “Of course not, if you think that way.</p><p>Why, Antoine, before we reach Michili- </p><p>makinac you’ll be helping me paddle.” </p><p>“Before we reach the river of the Mas- </p><p>coutens you will dig a grave,” answered </p><p>Goddin calmly. “But why are we in a </p><p>canoe. Dick?” </p><p> “I killed the dog who shot you and the</p><p>medicine-man who drove him to it,” was</p><p>the reply. “At the village they were sullen </p><p>and it needed only that to turn them into </p><p>a wolf-pack.” </p><p> “But the furs, and what remained of the</p><p>outfit! I wanted you to have the benefit </p><p>of them, my friend.” </p><p> “I wouldn’t touch a hide of them!” ex-</p><p>claimed Dick fiercely. “What is all the fur </p><p>in New France to your life, Antoine? </p><p>Don’t speak of such a thing now.” </p><p> “And my license, too,” continued the</p><p>Frenchman. “That is in a wallet in my </p><p>pocket, Dick. Don’t forget it when you </p><p>bury me.” </p><p> “I won’t listen to you!” cried the Vir-</p><p>ginian as he sprang to his feet. </p><p>112 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> He had been watching the long stretch</p><p>of river anxiously and suddenly he grasped </p><p>the bow of the canoe and set it afloat. </p><p> “They are coming, Antoine,” he whis-</p><p>pered as he pushed out into the current. </p><p>“Be brave, for it will be many hours before </p><p>we stop again.” </p><p>SEEKING always the swiftest cur- </p><p>rent, exerting all his strength in </p><p>every stroke, Dick drove the canoe </p><p>on. Hour after hour, without losing a pace </p><p>in distance or a moment in time, he kept </p><p>steadily on at top speed. The fear of the </p><p>pursuing Ouinibegous was constantly with </p><p>him, but it was never for himself. Always </p><p>there was the picture of their remorseless- </p><p>ness, the fiendish speed with which they </p><p>would bind Antoine to a tree that he might </p><p>not die before they could add to his agony. </p><p> The afternoon wore on and evening came.</p><p>The river bent often and sharply and there </p><p>were no long stretches by which he could </p><p>gauge the result of the race. At every </p><p>curve he glanced over his shoulder, but </p><p>darkness set in without his catching a </p><p>glimpse of the pursuing craft. He was </p><p>still ahead because he had only to flee, and </p><p>the savages had to guard against his hid- </p><p>ing on shore. </p><p> The night brought excessive weariness</p><p>but no cessation of his efforts. He knew </p><p>that he had probably held his own and now </p><p>he could not afford to forego the oppor- </p><p>tunity to increase his lead. The low </p><p>clouds, the absence of moon or stars, were </p><p>his hope, for the savages must go slowly to </p><p>make sure they did not pass him. Yet he </p><p>cursed the darkness fearfully for he could </p><p>no longer see the pale face of Antoine. </p><p>Even as he struggled on to save him life </p><p>might pass.' </p><p> This dread uncertainty finally brought</p><p>a halt, the first in long hours of paddling. </p><p>He laid aside his blade and crawled for- </p><p>ward. </p><p> “Antoine,” he whispered.</p><p> “Yes, Dick,” was the feeble answer.</p><p> “What can I do for you?”</p><p> “A drink, please. I am burning up, and</p><p>cold, too.” </p><p> Dick dipped the kettle over the side</p><p>and lifted Goddin’s head. Then he </p><p>wrapped blankets about him and returned </p><p>to the paddle in the stern. </p><p> More hours went by and in the silence</p><p>and darkness the canoe sped on into the </p><p>south. If Dick were weary, if his arms </p><p>and shoulders and back ached, he did not </p><p>know it. He thought only of what would </p><p>happen should the Ouinibegous overtake </p><p>him, of how he must outdistance them </p><p>so that he could have time to care for </p><p>Antoine. </p><p> As the night wore on Goddin became</p><p>delirious. He rolled and tossed in the </p><p>bottom of the canoe and often Dick was </p><p>forced to stop and thrust him down be- </p><p>neath the thwarts. He talked continually, </p><p>now of his boyhood in France, of his father </p><p>and mother, of Montreal, the river of the </p><p>Outaouas, of Perrot and Raddison and </p><p>Groseilliers, of many strange nations of </p><p>savages and of distant places he had seen. </p><p>Sometimes he spoke in French, sometimes </p><p>in the language of the Saulteurs, or the </p><p>Ouinibegous, the Hurons, the Outaouas </p><p>and even of the Nadouaissioux. </p><p> Dick understood them all, for he was</p><p>not only familiar with the Algonquin </p><p>dialects but, to his surprise, he had found </p><p>that the Ouinibegous spoke a language </p><p>almost the same as that of the Sheraws </p><p>of his own Virginia, while that of the </p><p>Nadouaissioux, who lived north of the </p><p>“great water,” as spoken by Goddin, </p><p>showed that these widely scattered nations </p><p>belonged to the same family. </p><p> The delirium added to Dick’s fear for</p><p>his friend since each contortion of the </p><p>Frenchman’s body reopened his wounds. </p><p>But he dared not stop for always there </p><p>was the greater fear of being overtaken </p><p>by the Ouinibegous. Of them and their </p><p>methods he had learned enough during </p><p>his Winter among them, and from Goddin’s </p><p>stories, to keep him pushing on after every </p><p>ounce of strength in his body seemed to </p><p>have been exhausted.</p><p> The Ouinibegous had once been a power-</p><p>ful nation, vain, insolent, deceitful, eaters of </p><p>their enemies’ flesh, wholly untrustworthy, </p><p>accused of more crimes than any people </p><p>except the Longhouses. Now they were </p><p>reduced to a comparative handful since </p><p>the Islinois had avenged themselves fora </p><p>bit of treachery that had brought exclama- </p><p>tions of horror even from several nations </p><p>of the savages themselves. Embittered in </p><p>their defeat, their desire for conquest and </p><p>torture had been sharpened. And all of </p><p>this would vent itself upon the helpless </p><p>Frenchman should they succeed in his </p><p>capture. </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>113 </p><p> In the dawn Dick kept on as he had all</p><p>night. He was without a plan, without </p><p>any alternative. He remembered that </p><p>Goddin had told him how, in the Spring </p><p>floods, it was possible to paddle across the </p><p>portage from the Ouisconsin into the river </p><p>which led to Lac Mecheygan. Now his </p><p>hopes depended upon that being true. If </p><p>he could reach this place and get through </p><p>to the river of the Mascoutens he might </p><p>escape in time to reach Lac Mecheygan </p><p>and Michilimakinac, where there undoubt- </p><p>edly would be Frenchmen and proper care </p><p>for his friend. </p><p> Dick estimated that, with the swift</p><p>current, he was making two leagues an hour, </p><p>if not a little more, and they had Wintered </p><p>about fifty leagues above the portage. If </p><p>he kept on paddling throughout the twenty- </p><p>tour hours he would come to the carrying- </p><p>place at noon. There he could leave the </p><p>Ouisconsin and in a short time be in waters </p><p>that flowed to Lac Mecheygan. </p><p> Success in his plan depended entirely</p><p>upon his ability to gain on the savages. </p><p>That they would continue the pursuit he </p><p>did not doubt, not only because he had </p><p>killed their medicine-man and another </p><p>but because they would not wish to incur </p><p>the hostility of the French and the powerful </p><p>nations allied with them. The Ouinibegous </p><p>in their weakened condition could not afford </p><p>to have news of their treachery reach </p><p>Michilimakinac. </p><p> But the forenoon hours dragged by</p><p>without his being able to learn whether </p><p>he were half a league or five leagues in the </p><p>lead. At dawn Goddin’s delirium had </p><p>ceased, but the bottom of the canoe was </p><p>covered with blood, a red stream trickling </p><p>down between Dick’s knees into the stern. </p><p>The wounded man’s face was deadly white. </p><p>He lay without movement and his eyes </p><p>were closed. </p><p> The suspense became unbearable to Dick.</p><p>Even if life remained it might pass at any </p><p>moment. At last, in frantic desperation, </p><p>heedless of consequences, he laid aside his </p><p>paddle and crawled forward. </p><p> “Antoine,” he whispered anxiously. “An-</p><p>toine. Are you awake?” </p><p> Goddin opened his eyes and looked up at</p><p>his friend. </p><p> “I was sleeping, Dick,” he whispered,</p><p>“but I am glad you wakened me for I feel </p><p>sure that I would have passed away without </p><p>knowing it.” </p><p> “Come! Come! You must not speak</p><p>that way!”/ </p><p> “Nor must you try to deceive yourself,</p><p>my friend. It is coming soon, very soon, </p><p>and I wish you would take me ashore, </p><p>lean me against a tree in the sun and let </p><p>me die looking at this fair land I have </p><p>grown to love.” </p><p> Dick was about to protest when Goddin’s</p><p>eyes closed, his face became contorted by </p><p>pain and blood flowed from his mouth. </p><p>The Virginian realized that what he had </p><p>tried to make himself believe could not be </p><p>true, that the end had come. </p><p>ILdB RETURNING to the stem he </p><p>KaB glanced back up-stream. He was </p><p>at the foot of a long, straight stretch, </p><p>the first he had passed since daylight. </p><p>Ahead the river turned sharply to the left, </p><p>curving at the foot of a low, grassy bank </p><p>upon which was a thick grove of oaks. It </p><p>was a spot Goddin would like, a fair view </p><p>of river and shore, and it would give Dick </p><p>an opportunity to watch his back-trail for </p><p>nearly a league. He paddled to it, landed, </p><p>and then with infinite care and at the cost </p><p>of all his strength he lifted Goddin to the </p><p>grass at the foot of the trees. </p><p> “Thank you, Dick,” said Antoine when</p><p>he looked up the long stretch of river. “It </p><p>is the place I would have chosen. 'Now if </p><p>I may have a drink, please. There. </p><p>Thank you. Now sit down in front of me, </p><p>Dick, and please do not look as if the end </p><p>of the world had come. There is no reason </p><p>why death should be so dreadful.” </p><p> “Antoine! Antoine!” cried the Virginian.</p><p>“Don’t speak so! You can not die </p><p>now!” </p><p> “You are young, my friend, and youth</p><p>always has the wrong idea of death. There</p><p>is no reason why death should not be </p><p>pleasant. It is for me as I lie here with this </p><p>view before me, with the smell of Spring </p><p>in the air and with you beside me. That is </p><p>one of the things I am most thankful for, </p><p>that I have known you, and that we have </p><p>this friendship. It has brought youth to </p><p>me, Dick, mine own youth back again, and </p><p>I owe you much.” </p><p> His eyes closed, his lips moved silently</p><p>for a moment, and he seemed to be asleep. </p><p>After a while he began to speak again. </p><p> “I am not regretful. I have lived a full</p><p>life, though I have not accomplished all </p><p>that I had wished. I have gone through it </p><p>ii4 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>with open eyes, knowing that this life in </p><p>the wilderness is filled with danger. But </p><p>it has been the sauce for the pudding, and </p><p>those of us who take the risks can not </p><p>complain when we are caught. </p><p> “I will be gone soon, Dick. I can see</p><p>only a little way up the river, just across </p><p>to the other shore. I want you to have my </p><p>license to trade, friend. It is the only </p><p>thing I can leave. And I will go content </p><p>that you will make honest use of it, that </p><p>you will see as I have seen that the fur is </p><p>only the beginning, that this fair land was </p><p>not meant for savages who spend their lives </p><p>in killing and torturing, that there is to </p><p>come a day when it will be filled with a </p><p>happy people. </p><p> “I know you have the vision, and the</p><p>true heart, and that you will do your share </p><p>in the work that is to be done. You may </p><p>never receive a reward, may even be perse- </p><p>cuted for what you do. History may never </p><p>give you credit, but those are little things. </p><p>Live so that you may die with a clean heart </p><p>and the honest conviction that you have </p><p>done your duty to your fellow-men. That </p><p>is the sum of life, and I know it will be </p><p>yours.” </p><p> Again his eyes closed and he was silent</p><p>for a long time. Dick feared the ei.1 had </p><p>come and waited in dumb terror. At last </p><p>the blood-blackened lips moved. </p><p> “I am going, Dick,” he whispered.</p><p>“Good-by, friend. I wish you would—no, </p><p>I will not ask a promise. I know you will </p><p>go on into this new land. I had hoped to </p><p>find it for my people, take it in the name of </p><p>my king. But yours will do as well, for it </p><p>can never be a king’s land but a country </p><p>of an honest, happy people. Good-bv, </p><p>Dick.” </p><p> The young Virginian, tears streaming</p><p>down his face, bent over the hand of his </p><p>friend and kissed it passionately. </p><p> “Antoine! Antoine!” he cried.</p><p> The fingers stiffened convulsively in his</p><p>clasp, blood flowed from the wounded </p><p>man’s lips, and Dick knew that he was</p><p>alone. </p><p> For a time he knelt there beside the body.</p><p>He had hoped, refused to believe, and now </p><p>that death had come to this man for whom </p><p>he had never had anything except love and </p><p>respect, he was as stunned as though the </p><p>Ouinibegous’ bullet had brought instant </p><p>oblivion. </p><p> Humbly, reverently, he stretched the</p><p>body out beneath the tree, folded the </p><p>hands across the chest and stood looking </p><p>down into the calm, peaceful face. </p><p> “It is when we die that we have the only</p><p>test of bravery,” he said aloud. “Life but </p><p>trains us for it. Here died a man with a </p><p>heart like those of the knights of old.” </p><p> The stillness of the bright, sunny Spring</p><p>noon wp suddenly rent by a chorus of </p><p>whoops Vnd shrill yells. Dick wheeled </p><p>toward the river to see three canoes, each </p><p>manned by a half-dozen savages, less than </p><p>half a league away. </p><p>CHAPTER XI </p><p>THE VISION </p><p>WITH his heart empty, in the deefl* </p><p>black despondency of youth, Dick’s </p><p>first thought was to remain where he was, </p><p>to stand above the body of his friend and </p><p>avenge him before he himself at last fell </p><p>beside it. He need not wait long. In a </p><p>few minutes all would be over. </p><p> But a remembrance of savage methods</p><p>of which he had heard quickened him to </p><p>action. It would be sacrilege to leave what </p><p>remained of his friend to be the plaything of </p><p>their inhuman passions, to permit that </p><p>strong, brave face to be mutilated even in </p><p>death. He stooped, grasped the body </p><p>about the waist and staggered down to tire </p><p>canoe with it. He dropped it on to the </p><p>blood-soaked blankets, for every second </p><p>was precious, and shoved off. A few </p><p>strokes took him around the bend but not </p><p>out of hearing of the yells of rage that </p><p>echoed up and down the river. </p><p> As grimly as twenty-four hours before,</p><p>Dick settled to his task. With a lead of </p><p>less than half a league not a stroke must be</p><p>missed. His own canoe was fast, one </p><p>Goddin had ordered made according to his </p><p>own design, but it was heavily loaded and </p><p>driven by only one paddle. The pursuing </p><p>canoes were larger, slower, but propelled by </p><p>half a dozen blades each, and the swift </p><p>current would play no favorites. </p><p> The one factor in Dick’s favor, the one</p><p>which probably had given him the last </p><p>uninterrupted moments with Antoine, was </p><p>the fact that the Ouinibegous would be </p><p>delayed by the fear that he would hide </p><p>behind some island or turn up a forest- </p><p>hidden tributary. Around one of the quick </p><p>bends it would be easy for him to go ashore, </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>ii5 </p><p>hide himself and the canoe, and watch them </p><p>pass. </p><p> But this would only serve to put his ene-</p><p>mies between him and ultimate safety, </p><p>while there was always the danger that a </p><p>sharp eye would catch a glimpse of sign on </p><p>the wet shore. For the present at least </p><p>his best course lay in keeping as far ahead as </p><p>possible and he drove on, always in the </p><p>swiftest part of the current, never overlook- </p><p>ing any position that would add to his speed. </p><p> He was weary, sore, losing strength, but,</p><p>like a true racer, he ascribed greater weari- </p><p>ness and debility to his adversaries, while </p><p>his will spurred muscles that shrieked their </p><p>agony but submitted. </p><p> An hour went by. The river twisted and</p><p>turned and not once did Dick catch sight of </p><p>the savages. Mid-af ternoon came and for the </p><p>first time he thought of the portage into the </p><p>river of the Mascoutens, the only route to </p><p>Lac Mecheygan and a land in which he could </p><p>find white men. He began to watch the </p><p>banks but nothing was familiar. He had </p><p>come up with Goddin when the water was </p><p>low at the end of a dry Summer. Now the </p><p>Ouisconsin was beginning to overflow its </p><p>banks and it was not at all like the stream </p><p>on which he had embarked the day before. </p><p> More perplexing than all else, his general</p><p>course was different. Early in the day he </p><p>had traveled in a southeasterly direction. </p><p>Now the declining sun was to the left of the </p><p>bow. It could mean only that he was trav- </p><p>eling toward the southwest, away from Lac </p><p>Mecheygan. </p><p> Dick, however, still hoped for the portage,</p><p>still watched the left bank for signs of the </p><p>carrying-place, but he dared not stop for a </p><p>careful search. So long as he could lift a </p><p>paddle he must keep on with the current. </p><p>If he had missed the portage it was a hazard </p><p>of the game all forest-rangers must expect. </p><p> Before sunset there was no longer any</p><p>doubt in his mind that he had passed it. </p><p>The character of the country had changed. </p><p>Pines had given way to oak, maple, linden, </p><p>elms, aspens and, along the shores, willows </p><p>in thick hedges. High bluffs now bordered</p><p>the valley, which was from one to two </p><p>leagues wide, and the river three or four </p><p>times as big as where he had begun his </p><p>journey seemed to wander about the great </p><p>bottom lands as if seeking a better channel. </p><p> The flood was not at its height for the</p><p>sandbars which formed the banks were </p><p>still dry. Dick could see evidences of how </p><p>the river sometimes had taken the entire </p><p>valley for its bed. Now it turned and </p><p>twisted, dashed from the high bluffs on one </p><p>side to those on the other, only to be turned </p><p>again by the great hills. </p><p> The river, too, was now thickly strewn</p><p>with islands. Sometimes they were bare, </p><p>white stretches of sand. Again they were </p><p>small, thin strips of higher ground upon </p><p>which great trees were growing. Always </p><p>the river gnawed at their sides and under- </p><p>mined trees hung far out over the current. </p><p>Often the islands stretched for a league or </p><p>two in a long line, connected by rows of </p><p>willows the tops of which waved in the cur- </p><p>rent. Two channels then resulted, each a </p><p>river in itself. </p><p> In the evening the stream straightened</p><p>out for more than a league and was com- </p><p>paratively free of islands. At the lower </p><p>end Dick laid aside his paddle and looked </p><p>back. As the canoe was whirled on by the </p><p>swift current he watched the far end of the </p><p>straight stretch. Now, if ever, the pursu- </p><p>ing canoes would be seen. But at last he </p><p>swung around the bend without a sight of </p><p>them. </p><p> In the evening chill his muscles had stiff-</p><p>ened in the short rest and when again he </p><p>took up his paddle it was only to torture </p><p>himself. Every muscle, every nerve, his </p><p>numbed brain, cried for rest. His eyes </p><p>ached. He was too near exhaustion even </p><p>to realize that he was hungry. </p><p> The canoe swung straight on in the center</p><p>of the swiftest part, sometimes stern first, </p><p>sometimes broadside to the current. He </p><p>was traveling without effort and darkness </p><p>would come soon. He stretched himself </p><p>out in the bottom and instantly was </p><p>asleep. </p><p> Dick was wakened by the sudden stop-</p><p>ping of the canoe and a swirling of water</p><p>against its side. Dazed, stiff, his brain as </p><p>cramped as his body, he lifted himself and </p><p>looked around. The sun was high. The </p><p>canoe had come to rest on the end of a sand- </p><p>bar opposite the base of a bluff which tow- </p><p>ered nearly four hundred feet above the </p><p>stream and against which the river dashed </p><p>furiously, only to be swung out again into </p><p>the center of the broad valley. </p><p> On the sandbar was dry driftwood and</p><p>Dick crawled out and started a fire. There </p><p>was a long stretch of water behind him, but </p><p>so far as he could see he was alone. Birds </p><p>sang, a fish sometimes flipped above the </p><p>ii6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>surface, but otherwise there was no move- </p><p>ment, no sound of life. He cooked break- </p><p>fast and, his strength and alertness revived, </p><p>immediately cursed himself for his folly in </p><p>so exposing himself to the pursuing Ouini- </p><p>begous. He shoved off and began to pad- </p><p>dle as swiftly as the day before. </p><p> WHEN nightfall came again Dick</p><p>mggb began to believe that he was no </p><p>longer followed. The savages had </p><p>not suspected his going down the Ouisconsin </p><p>past the portage. They were probably </p><p>seeking for him there, believing that he </p><p>had turned aside before he reached it or had </p><p>attempted to paddle through to the river </p><p>that led to Lac Mecheygan. All day he </p><p>had made his two leagues an hour, had </p><p>passed through a country as beautiful as </p><p>any he had ever seen, and yet there had </p><p>been no sign of human habitation. </p><p> He and Goddin had often talked with the</p><p>Ouinibegous during the Winter in an effort </p><p>to learn something of the “great water.” </p><p>that lay to the westward. But no member </p><p>of the tribe had ever been to it, though they </p><p>believed that it was only a few days’ pad- </p><p>dle down the Ouisconsin. It was a great </p><p>water, they said. On its shores strange, </p><p>fierce nations dwelt, and beneath its surface </p><p>were great monsters that swallowed whole </p><p>canoes and all that was in them at a gulp. </p><p>None of their people had ever dared ven- </p><p>ture so far. They would not risk it now. </p><p> In the darkness Dick again abandoned</p><p>himself to the current and stretched out in </p><p>the bottom of the canoe. When morning </p><p>came he found that some miracle had kept </p><p>him off the sandbars all night, and he was </p><p>still drifting, now straight west, in the same </p><p>cliff-bound valley. With his breakfast </p><p>came confidence that he need no longer fear </p><p>pursuit and for the first time he gave </p><p>thought to the problem that now confronted </p><p>him. The body beneath the blanket in </p><p>the bow must be buried. This necessity </p><p>redoubled his loneliness and his sense of </p><p>loss, but it also brought an idea. He set </p><p>the canoe afloat and began to paddle. </p><p> Now with the bluffs towering above him</p><p>on the right, now swinging at the base of a </p><p>high cliff on the left, turning from side to</p><p>side of the broad valley, Dick kept on with </p><p>the current. The river had become a great </p><p>noble stream, as beautiful as any he had </p><p>ever seen. He had gone so far to the south </p><p>since the murder of Goddin he found the </p><p>leaves budding, the land green with the </p><p>vividness of Spring. The little islands, </p><p>with which the channel was dotted, lay like </p><p>huge emeralds before him. The towering </p><p>bluffs had entirely lost their ruggedness </p><p>beneath their new cloaks of verdure. The </p><p>valley was a broad prairie studded with </p><p>clumps of oaks. </p><p> At noon the hills came close to the water</p><p>on either side, and then the river swung </p><p>around a bend and straightened out into </p><p>a long expanse which broadened at the far </p><p>end beneath a line of high hills. For two </p><p>leagues the water was unbroken except for </p><p>a few small islands directly in front. On </p><p>the left a long ridge rose nearly four hundred </p><p>feet above him, and on the right low, oak- </p><p>covered hills gave way to a broad prairie. </p><p> For a moment the sheer beauty and</p><p>grandeur of the scene held Dick breathless. </p><p> “Not even the river that flows into the</p><p>sea at New Amsterdam excels it!” he </p><p>whispered. </p><p> And then the significence of what he saw</p><p>impelled itself and he knew that even then </p><p>his speeding canoe was at the mouth of the </p><p>Ouisconsin, that he, the first of white men, </p><p>was looking upon the “great water,” the </p><p>upper reaches of the Misisepe. </p><p> Dazed by the magnificence of this won-</p><p>derful confluence of the two waters, Dick </p><p>sat motionless, only unconsciously keeping </p><p>the canoe headed with the current. The </p><p>force of the water swept him on past the </p><p>islands and then the view opened before </p><p>him to the north and south. For leagues in </p><p>either direction he could see the great </p><p>river. To the south it was broad, un- </p><p>broken, stretching from bluff to bluff. To </p><p>the north it widened, the channel studded </p><p>by many islands, washing at the base of the </p><p>hills on the west and at the edge of a prairie </p><p>on the east. Not until its strong, quiet, </p><p>sweeping current caught and whirled him </p><p>away to the south did Dick begin to paddle. </p><p> Straight on toward the west he went,</p><p>where a mountain towered above the water. </p><p>The current became swifter, not the bub- </p><p>bling, swirling, twisting water he had known </p><p>in the Ouisconsin, but a silent, powerful </p><p>drift, a force entirely in accord with the </p><p>majesty of such a stream. </p><p> Swept down, fighting steadily, at last</p><p>catching a huge eddy, Dick finally reached </p><p>the base of the mountain on the western </p><p>side and beached his canoe. Immediately </p><p>above him, twenty feet higher than the </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>117 </p><p>water, directly facing the entrance of the </p><p>Ouisconsin and commanding a broad sweep </p><p>of the great river itself, was the bare crown </p><p>of a knoll. </p><p> He set to work at once. With his ax he</p><p>made a rough spade with which to dig a </p><p>shallow grave in the rocky soil. He was </p><p>forced to cut out a thwart in the canoe to </p><p>remove the body of Goddin, but he reached </p><p>the knoll with it and laid it in the slight </p><p>depression. Over it he built up a tomb of </p><p>stones as high as his shoulders. Then he </p><p>hewed from a dry driftwood log a plank in </p><p>which he burned deeply with the heated </p><p>end of his ramrod this inscription: </p><p> ANTOINE GODDIN</p><p> He Served His People</p><p> “Oh, Antoine!” cried Dick as he stepped</p><p>back and looked at the result of his work: </p><p>“If you could only know! But you must </p><p>know! You must know that you he in the </p><p>land you sought, beyond the ‘great water.’ ” </p><p> In the spell of the emotion which gripped</p><p>him Dick stood for a time beside the tomb </p><p>of his friend. In the first moments he was </p><p>overpowered by a sense of loneliness. On </p><p>the Ouisconsin there had always been the </p><p>fear of being overtaken by the Ouinibegous. </p><p>Now he seemed to realize for the first time </p><p>that he was more completely, more utterly </p><p>alone than man had ever been before. </p><p> In that moment there was no room for</p><p>thought of the glory of his achievement. </p><p>If there were gladness it was only because he </p><p>had been able to lay the body of his friend </p><p>on the shore of the “great water” that he </p><p>had desired so in life, that beside it he might </p><p>peacefully sleep away the ages and watch </p><p>perhaps the coming of the people for whom </p><p>he had planned and hoped. </p><p> Loneliness and grief Dick suffered too, but</p><p>somehow it was no longer the former un- </p><p>reconciled bitterness. In its place had </p><p>come a quiet, sorrowful acceptance of the </p><p>fact that he must say good-by to the only </p><p>man he had ever really loved and travel </p><p>alone on the “great water,” hundreds of </p><p>leagues from the nearest of his race, com- </p><p>pletely surrounded by thousands and thou-</p><p>sands of savages. </p><p>GRADUALLY, despite his grief and </p><p>his loneliness, the one great thought </p><p>impressed itself. He, the first of the </p><p>white race, had found that for which men </p><p>had toiled and hoped through a century. </p><p>He, of the colony of Virginia, in one short </p><p>year had done what the French had sought </p><p>to do for scores of years. He had been </p><p>driven to it, had reached the river when </p><p>fleeing from certain death at the hands of </p><p>savages. But nothing could detract from </p><p>the indisputable fact that he was there, </p><p>that he had found the “great water,” that </p><p>to him had come the distinction of being </p><p>first. </p><p> He looked up and down the broad reaches</p><p>of the stream, across to the Ouisconsin, up </p><p>to the towering cliffs and bluffs. Never, </p><p>he thought, had he looked upon a grander </p><p>a more imposing, scene. Except that he </p><p>knew he was far to the west of Lac Mechey- </p><p>gan, he had no knowledge of the country in </p><p>which he found himself. What this Misi- </p><p>sepe was, whence it came, where it finally </p><p>reached the sea, he could not even guess. </p><p>Where he stood it flowed straight south </p><p>bending slightly toward the east. But for </p><p>all he could tell it might swerve off to the </p><p>west and the Gulf of California, or to the </p><p>east and the coast of the Western ocean </p><p>south of Virginia. </p><p> Behind him was a deep ravine that</p><p>seemed to offer an opportunity to scale the </p><p>bluff and see more of the beautiful land </p><p>that lay about him, and impulsively he </p><p>started toward it. </p><p> Deep into the heart of the hills he went,</p><p>his path darkened by great maples and elms </p><p>and oaks. A tiny stream trickled over </p><p>rocks and und§r moss, and as the ravine </p><p>narrowed he was forced back and forth </p><p>across it, sometimes straight up its bed. </p><p>Suddenly he was confronted by cliffs that </p><p>rose straight up past the tops of the tallest </p><p>trees. The water had cut and worn them, </p><p>and the rough surface was brilliant with </p><p>alternate strata of many colors. </p><p> Still following the bed of the stream,</p><p>Dick came at last to a pool at the base of a </p><p>cliff. From the top the water fell in a </p><p>broad, thin sheet. As he looked up he saw</p><p>that his only course lay behind the water- </p><p>fall. A ledge offered slippery footing and </p><p>he passed back of the cascade, around the </p><p>edge of the falls and up into a broader </p><p>ravine. </p><p> Here he turned to the left up a steep</p><p>slope clothed with oaks and at last, pushing </p><p>through a fringe of brush, came out with </p><p>startling suddenness upon the point of the </p><p>bluff. </p><p> Dick could not repress an exclamation</p><p>118 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>of amazement. Far to the north and the </p><p>south stretched the great river. Its width </p><p>was a measure of the mighty valley of which </p><p>it was the center. The glint of the sun from </p><p>its surface was only a flash of the bright- </p><p>ness of a vast land. The hazy distance en- </p><p>shrouded its coming and going and yet in- </p><p>vited pleasant journeying into the mystery </p><p>beyond. </p><p> The river itself held a peculiar power in</p><p>its vastness, its silent, majestic, incontest- </p><p>able might. There was no hurry, no tur- </p><p>moil. Calm, dignified, peaceful, it lay there, </p><p>the great artery through which flowed the </p><p>life of the world’s wonderland. </p><p> Directly opposite Dick opened the mouth</p><p>of the Ouisconsin, most beautiful of water- </p><p>ways. As far as he could see in either </p><p>direction steep, rounded, heavily-wooded </p><p>bluffs hemmed in the Misisepe on the west. </p><p>To the east and north lay a broad, green </p><p>plain which, to Dick, could have been in- </p><p>tended by the Maker only for the nurture of </p><p>a coming race. The whole land, in fact, </p><p>seemed dormant, expectant, lying ready. </p><p> “What an empire!” cried the Virginian</p><p>aloud. “Nothing could be more fair than </p><p>this. It is as Antoine said, the land for a </p><p>strong, happy race of people. If only he </p><p>might have lived to see it!” </p><p> The mention of his friend’s name brought</p><p>a realization of what his friend had longed </p><p>for, what he had planned and worked for, </p><p>what had been so cruelly denied him, and </p><p>what had now been given to one who had </p><p>not even striven for it. </p><p> The thought brought a sense of humility</p><p>and of responsibility. Not when he had </p><p>revolted at the rape of the Islinois, not when </p><p>he had avenged the death of Antoine God- </p><p>din, not when he had knelt beside his dying </p><p>friend, did Dick Jeffreys emerge from the </p><p>chrysalis of youth. It remained for this </p><p>knowledge that he had found a new land, </p><p>the land of which Antoine Goddin had </p><p>dreamed, to stiffen the fibers of his soul, to </p><p>bring him face to face with responsibility </p><p>and duty. </p><p> For a time Dick stood there, dizzy with</p><p>the idea, failing to grasp anything more than </p><p>the present. Then Antoine’s dying words </p><p>returned to him, and the thought and the </p><p>trust behind them. </p><p> “The fur is only the beginning. This fair</p><p>land was not meant for savages who spend </p><p>their lives in killing and torturing. I know </p><p>that you will have the vision, that you will </p><p>do your share. You will have done your </p><p>duty to your fellow-men. No, I will not </p><p>ask a promise. Your king will do as well, </p><p>for it can never be a king’s land, but a land </p><p>of honest, happy people.” </p><p> “Not for your sake, Antoine,” he said</p><p>aloud. “Not for the sake of any man. </p><p>You said once that a king is only a symbol </p><p>to you, a symbol of that which holds a </p><p>people together. You were right, my </p><p>friend. You were honest and brave, and </p><p>you had the vision. I can do no better </p><p>than follow.” </p><p> He walked forward to the very edge of</p><p>the cliff and there, silhouetted against the </p><p>April sky, high above the mighty river, he </p><p>cried in a loud voice: </p><p> “In the name of the people of England</p><p>and through their king, Charles the Second, </p><p>I claim this land.” </p><p> He turned, chose a giant oak several</p><p>paces behind him, and began to hew away </p><p>one side. When he had a broad, flat sur- </p><p>face he built a fire, heated his ramrod and </p><p>burned into the wood the words he had cried </p><p>to the heavens a few minutes before. </p><p> With some difficulty he counted the days</p><p>since Antoine had been shot and thereby </p><p>arrived at the date. Beneath his inscrip- </p><p>tion he burned: </p><p>April 17, 1673 </p><p> Dick did not even dream that two months</p><p>later to the day two canoes would appear </p><p>between the islands far up the Ouisconsin </p><p>and that, as he had doue a few hours be- </p><p>fore, Louis Joliet, representative of the </p><p>French king, and Jacques Marquette, </p><p>Jesuit, with five French voyageurs, would </p><p>sweep out into the current of the Misisepe. </p><p> Dick’s thoughts were elsewhere. Before</p><p>him lay six or seven hundred leagues of </p><p>wilderness, thousands upon thousands of </p><p>savages, hunger and toil and privation, </p><p>possibly torture and death, and, at the end </p><p>of it all, Sir William Berkeley with his </p><p>hatred and his noose. </p><p> He did not falter for an instant. His</p><p>face was stem, his eyes steady and bright </p><p>with a new zeal. He turned swiftly down </p><p>the side of the bluff with a glad shout— </p><p>“Back to Virginia!” </p><p>TO BE CONCLUDED </p><p>Seeds of Wrath </p><p>Author of "No Brains," "On Short Allowance," etc. </p><p> T WAS not the sacrilege alone</p><p>I ] that made the Reverend John </p><p>V my McTodd arise with sudden red </p><p>rage when Imbi tossed the gilded </p><p>crucifix off the home-made bamboo table </p><p>in the lamp-lit bungalow and grinned im- </p><p>pudently. It was the calm insolence of </p><p>the half-naked savage that seemed with </p><p>one stroke to rub in six months of sneering </p><p>effrontery from all his evil tribe. </p><p> McTodd came to partial sanity to find</p><p>the leg of a shattered Chinese bench in his </p><p>hand and himself bending over a prostrate </p><p>Imbi whose brownish face was running red. </p><p>To his own surprise the missionary found </p><p>himself not thinking in Christian horror </p><p>of his attack on a fellow-man but seeming </p><p>to listen, as if in a sardonic trance, to words </p><p>spoken months before by the portly, round- </p><p>faced secretary of the Board of Foreign </p><p>Missions who sent him to this fiendish </p><p>island. </p><p> “Use tact, gentleness, kindness,” in-</p><p>structed the well-groomed and fatherly </p><p>secretary in his comfortable New York </p><p>office. “The work is dangerous and I </p><p>honor you for having chosen it. These </p><p>people are real savages. You must win </p><p>their friendship by ignoring minor irrita- </p><p>tions and making them look up to you </p><p>for moral and spiritual guidance. We look </p><p>to you for results in keeping with your </p><p>education, enterprise and magnificent phys- </p><p>ical condition. Remember, above all, stick </p><p>to those three things: tact, gentleness, </p><p>kindness!” </p><p> “Tact!” snarled McTodd as the brown</p><p>form of Imbi began to writhe into con- </p><p>sciousness. “I’ll tact you! Let’s see where </p><p>I’ve started.” </p><p> The missionary lifted the wobbling head</p><p>in a mighty arm and examined his handi- </p><p>work closer. </p><p> “Scalp wound,” he muttered. “Lucky</p><p>I didn’t kill him!” </p><p> There was still no churchly regret in the</p><p>Reverend John McTodd. The softening </p><p>ties of the divinity school seemed to have</p><p>burst at one sudden explosion and made </p><p>him again the university man who had </p><p>mopped up whole football teams by his </p><p>own herculean strength and mad determi- </p><p>nation. He splashed a rag in a bucket of </p><p>water and swabbed the tribesman’s matted </p><p>forehead unemotionally until a realization </p><p>of his own position began to seep into his </p><p>brain and bring him up standing. The </p><p>youth he struck was the son of a chieftain. </p><p> “I’m done!” nodded the missionary as he</p><p>stared at his black shadow on the matted </p><p>wall. “Oh, well!” He shrugged his </p><p>shoulders. “It might as well come now. </p><p>I’m sick of it all—sick of it!” And then </p><p>he gasped in a lightning-flash of self-dis- </p><p>coverv. “I’m talking to myself!” he yelled, </p><p>clenching hairy hands till the nails bit into </p><p>his palms. “I’ve come to that! I’m talk- </p><p>ing to myself!” </p><p>119 </p><p>120 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Six months of loneliness, futility and sun-</p><p>heat had done it. Three months of self- </p><p>searching because of his failures had made </p><p>it worse. Filled with high ideals and </p><p>higher hopes he had come to this smelly </p><p>green-and-yellow island, a smooth-shaven, </p><p>blue-eyed blond giant among coffee-colored </p><p>pigmies. He wanted to be friends. </p><p> He had prayed for these people, smiled</p><p>upon them, played with their babes, tried </p><p>to insinuate the Word into their intellect; </p><p>but they only passed from curiosity to </p><p>aloofness and then to grinning mockery </p><p>until their monkey-like boycott had almost </p><p>driven him rabid. He, a man educated </p><p>to heights they never dreamed of, was a </p><p>pariah among them and a mark for con- </p><p>temptl </p><p> Had he known what the chieftain had</p><p>said about him in solemn, brush-lit council </p><p>in a grove of palms, he might have under- </p><p>stood more. </p><p> “The man is a fool,” said fat old Makosa</p><p>in his native dialect while the firelight </p><p>glistened on the knives of his warriors. </p><p>“He has the stature of a mighty warrior. </p><p>He talks of a God that does not appear, and </p><p>sings woman-songs, and plays with children. </p><p>Therefore his wits are gone.” </p><p> It was not a simple matter of eliminating</p><p>the Reverend John McTodd off-hand. </p><p>That was tried on a previous white man </p><p>but some queer devil-boat appeared soon </p><p>thereafter and hurled lyddite and gun- </p><p>cotton through village and palm-grove till </p><p>trees, huts and islanders were blown into </p><p>one mass of spattered ruin. Since then the </p><p>tribe was less able to meet invading war- </p><p>riors. Makosa never forgot the lesson. </p><p> The incident was known to McTodd</p><p>but his own attack on a native placed him </p><p>in a different situation; but something was </p><p>stirring his pulses strangely and he let it </p><p>grip him harder as he noted that Imbi was </p><p>looking at him steadily, without sign of </p><p>emotion, like a silent reptile biding its time. </p><p> “Get out!” snapped McTodd, pointing</p><p>with the bench-leg toward the veranda. </p><p> Imbi’s head went down like a whipped</p><p>dog’s and he limped along queerly on all </p><p>fours, shuffling his knees at every move </p><p>and throwing grotesque shadows from the </p><p>lamplight. He turned the corner of the </p><p>door and vanished, leaving a sinister red </p><p>trail along the matting, like a portent of </p><p>things to come. McTodd’s lips tight- </p><p>ened. </p><p> “It’s war,” he nodded. “It’s me against</p><p>’em all. Well, so be it. I’m ready!” </p><p>I I A GREAT load seemed to fall from </p><p>|]32g|i his shoulders. No longer did he </p><p>« i have to meet these creatures with </p><p>gentleness, seek their friendship, turn the </p><p>other cheek. He knew now that he loathed </p><p>the whole dirty tribe and owned a majestic </p><p>white man’s contempt for them that he </p><p>never suspected before. He had not been </p><p>a hypocrite. He had striven mightily and </p><p>lashed his own soul when he failed. He </p><p>had prayed for guidance night after night, </p><p>seeking aid for his lonely heart while tom- </p><p>toms beat for orgy-dances on the beach </p><p>below. </p><p> At first when he looked up toward the</p><p>glaring tropic stars for comfort he thought </p><p>his prayers brought him surcease; yet </p><p>lately those prayers had only rung in his </p><p>ears like hollow noises. But now it was </p><p>different. </p><p> A hundred generations of warrior-clans-</p><p>men forefathers were whispering strange </p><p>tilings to his soul, making his blood thrill </p><p>with pagan thoughts that had nothing to </p><p>do with church or creed. He half-realized </p><p>he was running amuck, but though his </p><p>flinty Scotch conscience railed at him it </p><p>only made him worse through defiance of it. </p><p>He had crossed his Rubicon and thrown </p><p>aside his cross. </p><p> “I’m a Christian no longer,” he muttered,</p><p>“and I might as well make a good job of it.” </p><p> McTodd’s glance fell on a little black</p><p>prayer-book with gilded edges on the green </p><p>cloth under his reading-lamp. He picked </p><p>it up and tossed it far out of the door, </p><p>smiling grimly while it rustled through the </p><p>hrush. The crucifix on the floor next </p><p>caught his attention. It was given him by </p><p>a Catholic priest who wished him well. </p><p>The crucifix was just about to follow the</p><p>prayer-book when McTodd stopped him- </p><p>self. His action was too much like Imbi’s. </p><p>Instead, he placed the gleaming thing on </p><p>the table carefully. </p><p> “I have deserted my God,” he ruminated,</p><p>“but I’m not a savage—yet!” </p><p> On the table was a letter on dainty blue</p><p>stationery, now soiled by much thumbing. </p><p>It had come to him in Manila when he first </p><p>started for this island and even more than </p><p>the prayer-book it had been his comfort. </p><p>The gracious daughter of the secretary of </p><p>the Board of Foreign Missions had written </p><p>The Seeds of Wrath </p><p>121 </p><p>it and shown her faith and affection in every </p><p>word. He knew it by heart. </p><p> “I know you will come back in triumph</p><p>because you can not fail,” it said. “You </p><p>will win the hearts of these people as you </p><p>won mine, because of yourself and because </p><p>you will treat them in a way they can </p><p>understand.” </p><p> There were to have been golden days</p><p>after McTodd made good on the island and </p><p>won his way to promotion. That had been </p><p>thoroughly understood. </p><p> McTodd smiled tiredly. The letter had</p><p>taken him through many a trouble and put </p><p>heart into him; but now it was like a thing </p><p>from some past age, still sacred because of </p><p>its memories, but without influence. </p><p> “I can not fail!” he laughed, while the</p><p>walls echoed the sound weirdly. “Win the </p><p>hearts of these people? Huh—I’ll win ’em </p><p>if they get within range!” </p><p> Acting on that idea, McTodd went to a</p><p>trunk in his bedroom and dug out a fine </p><p>Navy revolver. It worked perfectly and </p><p>the cartridges fitted, and that was all the </p><p>man cared to know just then. </p><p> It was the calm before the storm and the</p><p>lonely man sensed it as he walked to the </p><p>veranda and took a look about. Above, </p><p>the stars shone with tropic boldness. To </p><p>his right, beyond the fronds of a big palm </p><p>tree, the dim firelights of a hut village </p><p>flickered. To his left a black mountain </p><p>sloped upward to a grim crater silent for </p><p>many decades. Ahead, below the cliff on </p><p>which the bungalow stood, the Pacific </p><p>pounded on the reefs and bellowed its </p><p>thundering sea-song, or showed its phos- </p><p>phorescent breakers on the beach below' </p><p>the village. Into McTodd’s nostrils came </p><p>sweetish, dampish smells from foliage too </p><p>thick for its acreage. Into his strained ears </p><p>came no human sound. </p><p> For ten minutes the big tow-headed</p><p>Scotsman in white drill stood like a sentinel, </p><p>and then came the pattering of feet on the </p><p>gravel below the bungalow. The natives </p><p>were coming. McTodd stepped into the</p><p>house, sat down, picked up a book, and pre- </p><p>tended to read. He found his heart beating </p><p>strangely but his nerves steady as a rock, </p><p>and he only looked up again when eight </p><p>brownish figures had crowded through the </p><p>doorway and the lamplight glittered on </p><p>the steel of their big, cruel knives. </p><p> It was a motley delegation of undersized</p><p>half-humans. Baleful head-hunter eyes </p><p>stared from under matted mops of black </p><p>hair. Rainbow-colored loin-cloths—blue, </p><p>green, yellow, red—flashed fantastically </p><p>with ever)' move of queerly-shaped bodies </p><p>and thin, bent legs. The leader had the </p><p>greenest cloth of all, the biggest knife, the </p><p>thinnest, crudest face. It was Taafa, sub- </p><p>chief and prime-devil, now frankly angry. </p><p> “What for you bang Imbi?” he de-</p><p>maded, in an outburst of trader’s English. </p><p> “Because Imbi was fresh,” returned the</p><p>white man, equally frank. </p><p> The word was new to Taafa.</p><p> “Fraish?” he snarled. “What fraish?”</p><p> The devil within McTodd made him</p><p>show his disdain for the sub-chief. </p><p> “That is none of your business,” he</p><p>replied, quite evenly. </p><p> The words were not understood but the</p><p>inflection was. Eight hands went to sword- </p><p>hilts. Seven stayed there, but the great </p><p>blade of Taafa flashed out with a sweep of </p><p>his scrawny arm. </p><p> “What for you bang Imbi?” he roared</p><p>again. Then he stuttered. “You—you </p><p>go away-quick!” He pointed with the </p><p>sword toward the ocean and continents </p><p>beyond. “You go—go—go!” he screamed. </p><p>You go other place quick. You no go-” </p><p> He flexed his wrist and made the sword</p><p>sing through the air. </p><p> “So!” returned McTodd, coolly. “That</p><p>means I’m invited to leave the island. Well, </p><p>you leave the bungalow. You savvy? </p><p>You go—go—git!”</p><p> And he arose to full height and pointed</p><p>toward the door. He had stood six months </p><p>of insult and now he was through for good. </p><p>INCREDULITY and amazement </p><p>showed for an instant on the scarred </p><p>face of the savage and then he let his </p><p>natural impulses flow, forgetting the lesson </p><p>of the bombardment, forgetting everything. </p><p> “Yah!” he shrieked, brandishing his</p><p>sword and advancing on McTodd fero- </p><p>ciously while the others yelled and prepared </p><p>for action. </p><p> The temper of the savages was up. So</p><p>was McTodd’s. The air was electric. It </p><p>was war. </p><p> The missionary took a step backward</p><p>when the sharp blade cut the air toward </p><p>him and then he went mad—violent, </p><p>Berserk mad. He crashed a mighty sledge- </p><p>hammer fist with all his strength into </p><p>Taafa’s face. The sub-chief went limp </p><p>122 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>and slumped to the floor while the other </p><p>screaming islanders came on with their </p><p>knives. McTodd whipped out the pistol. </p><p>He fired into the thick of them while the </p><p>bungalow rocked with the thunder. </p><p> One came under the weapon, got brushed</p><p>aside by a frantic elbow, and slipped up </p><p>behind him, grinning evilly. The white </p><p>man whirled and smashed the screaming </p><p>savage through the flimsy wall. The </p><p>bungalow stood on a rock alongside a ravine. </p><p> An agile figure dodged up to McTodd</p><p>as he turned again. The point of a knife </p><p>just touched his ribs. The maddened </p><p>Scotsman struck with the pistol-butt in his </p><p>fingers and the native dropped silently. </p><p> Clear for an instant, McTodd leveled</p><p>the pistol and pulled the trigger fast. </p><p>The first wild shot missed a figure jumping </p><p>toward him. The next did not. Neither </p><p>did the other three. The place was filled </p><p>with acrid smoke, spitting flame, shrieking, </p><p>dancing fighters and the roar of powder- </p><p>explosions until at last when the white man </p><p>pulled trigger only an empty click resulted. </p><p> With one forearm the panting, sweating</p><p>McTodd brushed away the perspiration </p><p>trickling into his eyes and his sight took </p><p>quick account of the scene. Only one </p><p>brownish figure faced him, a poisonous little </p><p>reptile with curved knife in hand, hesitating </p><p>whether to attack or run. The blond giant </p><p>grimly reversed the pistol in his hand and </p><p>started with the butt to finish the job, </p><p>stepping over dark figures that were either </p><p>still or quivering. The last native gave a </p><p>yell of terror and vanished. </p><p> “That means more are coming,” panted</p><p>McTodd, unsteadily. </p><p> The conqueror looked about the room.</p><p>It was a wreck. His chairs were splintered, </p><p>the pictures on the wall had crashed down, </p><p>his desk was overturned, the side-wall </p><p>toward the ravine was half-gone, and on </p><p>the floor brown figures with green and </p><p>yellow and red loin-cloths were huddled </p><p>queerly, their knives glinting on the reddish </p><p>matting between them. Taafa, the sub- </p><p>chief, had come to consciousness and was</p><p>starting to rise; but when he saw the </p><p>Scotsman’s gaze upon him he played dead </p><p>quickly. </p><p> McTodd allowed himself a bitter smile.</p><p>His brain was working fast. </p><p> “A hostage!” he murmured, thickly. “A</p><p>loaf of bread, a box of cartridges, and </p><p>thou—until some boat arrives!” </p><p> The white giant strode to Taafa, grabbed</p><p>him by the scruff of the neck as he would </p><p>a snarling dog, dodged a snapping attempt </p><p>to bite, swung him to his legs, rushed him </p><p>into the bedroom, and tied his hands and </p><p>feet with a rope. After that the pistol was </p><p>reloaded and the missionary sat on the bed </p><p>to get his breath and consider his next move </p><p>while Taafa writhed around the floor. </p><p> The white man’s absent-minded glance</p><p>roved to the front room where the huddled </p><p>brown figures were lying under the garish </p><p>light from a lamp that still burned. As if </p><p>seeing the sight for the first time McTodd </p><p>stiffened and gasped, then buried his face </p><p>in trembling, remorseful hands. </p><p> “And I came here to preach peace and</p><p>good will!” he sobbed, brokenly. </p><p> The reaction had set in. He began to</p><p>tremble. 'Jhe pit of his stomach seemed </p><p>gone. He felt alone—terribly, frightfully </p><p>alone, like a child sweating from a bad </p><p>dream and peering into the darkness. The </p><p>fronds of the palms murmured in the wind </p><p>outside and he jumped from sheer cat- </p><p>nervousness, then looked out of a window </p><p>toward the quiet stars, finding no comfort </p><p>because blood-guilt was on his conscience </p><p>and he and his God had parted company. </p><p>He shivered as with a chill. </p><p> And then McTodd noted the vicious fa£e</p><p>of Taafa leering below him and his fighting </p><p>spirit returned. Hatred called to hatred, </p><p>louder than the call of conscience or soften- </p><p>ing influences. The snarling little devil </p><p>seemed to typify all the bitter humiliations </p><p>and defeats the white man had suffered and </p><p>McTodd longed to throttle him; but Taafa </p><p>was too valuable as a hostage. </p><p> That brought up the question of</p><p>McTodd’s immediate future. Should he </p><p>hide in the brush with Taafa and dodge</p><p>from thicket to thicket, a mark for any </p><p>spear while he slept, or should he. face the </p><p>whole crowd where he was and bargain </p><p>with them, beat them, or go down like a </p><p>white man? </p><p> His jaw set, McTodd decided to stay to</p><p>the finish, even though the native who fled </p><p>had already spread the alarm through </p><p>village and palm-grove. </p><p>THE fleeing one had come upon old </p><p>Makosa squatting in front of his hut </p><p>and chatting with two of his con- </p><p>freres. The runner burst upon them in </p><p>great excitement and haste, neglecting to </p><p>The Seeds of Wrath </p><p>123 </p><p>mention that he had taken time to cut </p><p>himself so as to show honorable wounds of </p><p>mortal combat. </p><p> “The white man has gone quite mad!”</p><p>panted the wide-eyed bearer of tidings. </p><p>“Seven are gone and I alone stood him off </p><p>until my wounds drained my strength. He </p><p>is quite mad!” </p><p> The old chief’s nut-brown face skewered</p><p>into many wrinkles and he scratched the </p><p>dazzling white wool of his head while </p><p>tribesmen came running to hear the tale- </p><p>bearer’s story, embellished with liner detail </p><p>as the crowd augmented and ending with a </p><p>frenzy of words. When it was all over </p><p>Makosa arose slowly and counted noses. </p><p> “You have heard. What shall be done?”</p><p>he asked. </p><p> Cruel faces snarled monkey-like; savage-</p><p>looking knives were fondled and voices </p><p>chattered shrilly in the crowd that swirled </p><p>about the fat-stomached, spindle-shanked </p><p>old chieftain. </p><p> “Here!” snarled a warrior, stretching out</p><p>a curved blade. “Are we children, to stand </p><p>here talking? What are these for?” </p><p> “And have another devil-boat throw ruin</p><p>into us?” reminded Makosa. </p><p> The crafty old chieftain was thinking</p><p>hard. Leaving aside the terrible lesson </p><p>given two years before by a big cruiser </p><p>with a most demoniac battery, Makosa saw </p><p>the big blond white missionary as a State </p><p>problem in himself. Seven men were </p><p>gone—seven warriors from a thinned com- </p><p>munity which already had trouble to ward </p><p>off raiders who came annually. </p><p> From a high hill on a clear day Makosa</p><p>could look across the Pacific’s sunlit waters </p><p>and see the faint blue mountain-tops of </p><p>Chandapan, whose people had never been </p><p>bombarded and—who owned anuoying war- </p><p>canoes. To Makosa seven fighters meant </p><p>something—and the blond white giant still </p><p>had that pistol. </p><p> “But the man is mad—mad—mad!”</p><p>chattered the runner, still haranguing </p><p>public opinion. </p><p> “Enough!” roared Makosa. “He is not</p><p>mad! He is come to sanity! Look you. </p><p>His mind has been the mind of a witless </p><p>child and his body the body of a mighty </p><p>warrior. He sang for women and played </p><p>with children. He spoke of a Gospel </p><p>advising meekness before all enemies, being </p><p>quite demented. But now his brain is </p><p>cleared. He thinks of women and children </p><p>and meekness no longer. He is come to </p><p>sanity. He is a warrior. I shall see him.” </p><p> And thereupon the chieftain did so.</p><p> The scene at the interview was as formal</p><p>as a meeting of Mandarins, colorful as a </p><p>vivid picture by some splashy impressionist, </p><p>grim as the slumbering old volcano that </p><p>towered above the lamplit bungalow. Ma- </p><p>kosa, in State regalia, consisting of a sword, </p><p>two daggers and a purple-and-yellow sash, </p><p>waddled through the bungalow door, fol- </p><p>lowed by his choicest warriors, with the </p><p>spear-carrying populace massed behind him. </p><p> Further inside the room the cold-eyed</p><p>McTodd faced them stiffly, holding the </p><p>blue-steel pistol ready in his right hand and </p><p>keeping the bound and mutilated Taafa </p><p>before him as an exhibit and a hostage. </p><p>The lamplight gleamed impartially on white </p><p>steel and blue steel that seemed to shimmer </p><p>with the electricity in the air. </p><p> When workmen had cleared away the</p><p>huddled heap of lost warriors, the grunting </p><p>Makosa squatted on the matting like some </p><p>distorted Buddha come to give judgment. </p><p>The rest of the warriors did likewise and, </p><p>seeing it was not war but palaver, McTodd </p><p>warily seated himself on the arm of a bat- </p><p>tered chair, wondering what was coming </p><p>next. </p><p> In trade-English Makosa opened with</p><p>accusations concerning Imbi and seven </p><p>warriors. McTodd responded with coun- </p><p>ter-accusations, throwing in frank opinions </p><p>of the whole tribe, starting with Makosa </p><p>and working down. Brown forms behind </p><p>the chieftain began to sway restlessly like </p><p>long grass in a breeze; but Makosa held </p><p>out a commanding hand and the murmuring </p><p>subsided.</p><p> Then the chieftain began to talk in</p><p>earnest, picking words slowly from his small </p><p>vocabulary; and as he went along the </p><p>white man’s face showed alternate amaze- </p><p>ment, calculation, wariness and relief. </p><p>It was a cold proposition to unfold to a </p><p>missionary who came to preach a Gospel </p><p>of gentleness but it brought a glint of hope </p><p>to his eyes for at least it offered a way out— </p><p>if it were sincere. </p><p> “You—you mean you want me to join</p><p>your warriors?” blurted the dazed white </p><p>man after Makosa had finished. </p><p> The old chief nodded affirmatively and</p><p>McTodd’s eyes narrowed. </p><p> “It may be treachery and it may be true,”</p><p>he muttered. “It’s worth considering.” </p><p>124 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> His searching, level glance met Makosa’s</p><p>and he found it hard to conceal his loathing </p><p>of the dirty little fat savage, but he did it </p><p>by laughing mirthlessly. </p><p> “And I was a Christian missionary! Oh,</p><p>well, I’ve almost gone the whole distance </p><p>now—what’s the difference?” He nodded </p><p>to the chieftain. “All right. I’ll take you </p><p>up, but I’ll be the boss. Understand? </p><p>There’s going to be discipline!” He re- </p><p>lapsed into trade-English, pointing a finger: </p><p>“White man say you do, you do; you no do, </p><p>white man shoot!” </p><p> Makosa caught the general idea and</p><p>nodded grave approval, for the wily old </p><p>chieftain estimated this six-foot-three white- </p><p>skin to be a most desirable ally. Thus the </p><p>palaver was concluded; after which Makosa </p><p>arose and blandly started to waddle toward </p><p>Taafa. Thinking fast, the white man </p><p>decided to let the sneering little devil go, </p><p>so he stood aside, while the general populace </p><p>started to file out. </p><p> Severing Taafa’s cords Makosa started</p><p>to leave also, but his eye caught the gleam- </p><p>ing crucifix on the table. Half-forgetting </p><p>McTodd, he began to edge toward it. </p><p>When he got in front of the table he turned </p><p>as if to look toward Taafa but his left hand </p><p>was behind him. </p><p> “Drop that!” snarled McTodd, jumping</p><p>toward him. “Here, you dirty little thief— </p><p>let go of that!” </p><p> He wrenched the crucifix out of the chief’s</p><p>hand while warriors in the doorway turned </p><p>and stood irresolutely. McTodd found his </p><p>anger seething up again. </p><p> “I’ve a notion to ram it down your</p><p>throat!” he roared into the livid face of old </p><p>Makosa. </p><p> Then another thought struck him.</p><p> “No—here, you take it!” he thundered.</p><p>“You’ll keep it now and every day I’ll </p><p>demand an accounting! It will keep you </p><p>out of mischief. I hereby appoint you </p><p>the Grand Chief Bearer of Loot. Now </p><p>go—git!” And he pointed toward the</p><p>doorway. </p><p> The old chief grabbed the glittering thing</p><p>thrust into his hand and fairly flew out of </p><p>the door, knocking aside swordsmen com- </p><p>ing to his rescue, who stood uncertainly </p><p>for a moment before following him for </p><p>council. When they had gone clamoring </p><p>down the hill the big white man stood alone </p><p>in his battered living-room, his temper </p><p>sagging away again. </p><p> “And I have fallen even to this sacrilege!”</p><p>he murmured, bowiqg his head. “Well, </p><p>so be it.” He straightened again and his </p><p>mouth set in a grim line. “I am no better </p><p>than my fellow-savages—as is proper. </p><p>And now that I’ve started I’ll make ’em </p><p>better warriors, dead or alive!” </p><p>FILLED with this aggressive reso- </p><p>lution McTodd strode to the village </p><p>next morning, still half expecting to </p><p>be surrounded and killed but prepared for </p><p>anything. Dirty brown warriors gave him </p><p>strange, half-awed and half-hateful looks, </p><p>but none molested him even though he </p><p>walked into the hut of the chief. </p><p> “Get your gang together!” ordered</p><p>McTodd, pointing to a cleared field. The </p><p>white man seemed like a person possessed </p><p>of the demon of energy so old Makosa </p><p>nodded and ordered his crowd to work, </p><p>not without first accounting for that </p><p>crucifix. </p><p> “Now we’ll have some drilling,” an-</p><p>nounced McTodd to the spearmen who </p><p>straggled out past him. “It’s long since </p><p>I was in the university cadets but you won’t </p><p>know the difference anyhow. Hey, you— </p><p>turn around—go other way!” </p><p> He grabbed a warrior and shoved him</p><p>toward the field briskly. Subconsciously </p><p>he was glorying in his unhallowed leader- </p><p>ship. He had been a pariah here. This </p><p>was different. </p><p> Sorting out his wondering savages by</p><p>stature, separating swordsmen from spear- </p><p>men, the white giant finally managed to </p><p>aline his dubious rabble of brown non- </p><p>descripts and teach them elemental com- </p><p>mands in terse English. At first the crowd </p><p>gave interest and squirmed through easy </p><p>evolutions because it was novel, but within</p><p>an hour the ranks began to sag and indiffer- </p><p>ence took place of obedience. </p><p> Then McTodd commenced to assert his</p><p>discipline with calculated audacity. </p><p> The first savage who fell out of line was</p><p>cuffed and shoved back. The second was </p><p>kicked and straightened up. The third </p><p>was knocked down instantly and scowls </p><p>began to meet the white man from every </p><p>side, but he did not care now. He meant </p><p>to overcome them right at the start. Once </p><p>after two hours of it they started for him </p><p>but the ready pistol-muzzle came forth and </p><p>they fell back. </p><p> McTodd knew he was arrogant, over-</p><p>The Seeds of Wrath </p><p>125 </p><p>bearing, even brutal, but the memory of </p><p>those six months of purgatory was with </p><p>him always. He would either master these </p><p>half-humans or go down shooting. For a </p><p>time it looked as if he were going down. </p><p>He felt like a lion-tamer, able to face these </p><p>wild creatures but loath to turn his back. </p><p> Then Makosa arrived, still clutching that</p><p>gilded crucifix. McTodd gave him public </p><p>obeisance and led him to the front rank </p><p>and made him stand there. The queer old </p><p>man in the purple-and-yellow breech-cloth, </p><p>holding that gleaming thing, became the </p><p>center of all attention. McTodd noted the </p><p>change and smiled mirthlessly. He was </p><p>learning. A chieftain holding an emblem </p><p>in the front rank means something the </p><p>world over. McTodd kept him there for </p><p>good and through this miracle the first day </p><p>passed and the white giant- had gone far </p><p>toward establishing mastery. </p><p> Seven days the implacable Scotsman</p><p>drilled the natives with the aid of tongue, </p><p>fist and pistol, and by the eighth they </p><p>could swing by him in solid ranks, answer- </p><p>ing to his iron discipline. Some had given </p><p>trouble but these were knocked to the </p><p>ground relentlessly; and somehow, in place </p><p>of black looks, McTodd noted he was </p><p>getting more willing obedience. After that </p><p>it was easier. He had them under control. </p><p> It was a different McTodd now. He had</p><p>become a bearded, coatless athlete with the </p><p>terse manners of a truckman and the bark- </p><p>ing voice of a drill-sergeant. He was no </p><p>longer the gentle churchman; he never </p><p>expected to be one again; but at least he </p><p>was now a master and intended to remain </p><p>so until a trading-schooner came to take </p><p>him away. </p><p> On the ninth day the natives felt impelled</p><p>to start a weird, rhythmic chant that ran </p><p>from rank to rank as they marched until it </p><p>swelled to the full four hundred voices. </p><p>McTodd stood the ghoulish noise as long as </p><p>he could, then— </p><p> “Stop that!” he barked.</p><p> Slowly the crooning died away and</p><p>questioning eyes turned toward the white</p><p>man and made him embarrassed. Though </p><p>that noise gave him the creeps it was not </p><p>policy to stop the natural chanting of </p><p>marching men. </p><p> “Here!” he yelled after an awkward</p><p>pause. “If you must sing, learn music!” </p><p>His mind cast about for something, but he </p><p>knew little except the tunes of the clergy. </p><p>“All right,” he shouted, recklessly, “sing </p><p>this: </p><p> Onward, Christian soldiers,</p><p> Marching as to war,</p><p> With the Cross-"</p><p> The sacrilege seemed to stick in his</p><p>Scotch throat but he shrugged his shoulders. </p><p>It was no worse than the rest of this busi- </p><p>ness so McTodd finished in a roaring voice </p><p>that seemed to have defiance in it; and </p><p>gradually, little by little, the mass of brown </p><p>figures took it up imitatively as the white </p><p>man chanted it over and over again. </p><p>THEY sang it. when the men of </p><p>Chandapan came in war-canoes one </p><p>morning, ready to sweep all before </p><p>them. McTodd’s spearmen sang it when </p><p>they charged in a solid, disciplined phalanx </p><p>as the invaders swarmed to the beach and </p><p>the white man’s pistol spat into them. </p><p>McTodd’s swordsmen sang it when they </p><p>grappled at close quarters. His bowmen </p><p>did not sing at first because they were </p><p>cleverly concealed by squads in ambush, </p><p>but later all joined in the chorus while six </p><p>big upturned war-canoes floated dolefully </p><p>up to the sands; and still later they roared </p><p>it in mad celebration while the white man </p><p>tried to sleep in his bungalow and wondered </p><p>how soon a sail would appear. </p><p> He was master and arbiter of the island</p><p>and yet he was strangely uncomfortable, </p><p>for at night his searching Scotch conscience </p><p>asked him questions that he could not </p><p>answer except by defiance. </p><p> He had come a Christian and a gentle-</p><p>man. He would leave as a hard-hitting, </p><p>reckless, masterful, brutal adventurer, unfit </p><p>to mingle with Christians because his </p><p>Christianity was a frail thing that fell away </p><p>like a thin coat of shellac when his mighty</p><p>muscles obeyed a pagan temper. Thus he </p><p>reasoned during the long nights when that </p><p>conscience made him squirm to its merciless </p><p>lash. </p><p> In the old times he had winced from</p><p>humiliation when the sun was up but slept </p><p>like a child when night came. Now by </p><p>day he bullied and domineered like a man </p><p>who did not care, and at night he writhed. </p><p>As the weeks lengthened into months he </p><p>found his alternate arrogance and self- </p><p>abasement worse until the nights became </p><p>a terror and to keep his mind occupied </p><p>he stayed as late as possible around the </p><p>126 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>village-fires of his people, holding arbitrary </p><p>inspections concerning personal cleanliness, </p><p>listening to their cases at law, giving ir- </p><p>revocable judgments, doling out medicines </p><p>for their ills, and teaching them to chant </p><p>the sacred songs he knew while he beat </p><p>time ironically on a goat-skin drum. </p><p> And at last a sail appeared.</p><p> Relieved and yet more scared because</p><p>it brought to a focus the problem of his </p><p>future, the white giant, with a lump in his </p><p>throat, watched the thing grow from a tiny </p><p>speck on the horizon to a good-sized </p><p>auxiliary schooner that cast anchor off </p><p>the beach and lowered a boat. But before </p><p>the schooner had come within two miles </p><p>of shore McTodd had shaved, donned </p><p>decent clothes, and even composed himself </p><p>for the first step toward the inevitable con- </p><p>fession of his ghastly failure. </p><p> He managed to pull himself together and</p><p>start toward his crisis manfully, but when </p><p>he returned among his dusky minions on </p><p>the beach he rubbed his eyes at what he </p><p>saw, and trembled as if with palsy. </p><p> That lissome, white-clad figure alongside</p><p>the portly man in the boat, calling and </p><p>waving to him—where had he seen it before? </p><p>He passed a hand over his muddled head </p><p>and pieced the matter out slowly from a </p><p>flood of memories. It had lived as his </p><p>dark-eyed queen in a castle-of-dreams, </p><p>among roses and geraniums and shady </p><p>nooks and sunlit meadows in some distant </p><p>rainbow-land where gentle beings with fair </p><p>skins held human companionship and rarely </p><p>knocked each other down. It did not </p><p>belong on this ferocious island. The thing </p><p>was incongruous—like a white fairy wander- </p><p>ing into hell. </p><p> McTodd pinched himself to see if he were</p><p>awake, but he was, for the radiant vision </p><p>in tailor-made garments was stepping off </p><p>the beached boat and its hand touched his </p><p>and its beautiful, rounded face with the red </p><p>lips smiled into his until the smile changed </p><p>to a look of horrified amazement, and then </p><p>to infinite pity and tenderness. </p><p> “John!” she gasped, taking him into her</p><p>anxious arms like a protecting mother. </p><p> It was only one word but its vibrant</p><p>compassion thrilled his soul and tied his </p><p>tongue so he could only hold her mutely, </p><p>as if afraid she would vanish into dreams </p><p>again. </p><p> “John—the lines on your face!” She</p><p>drew away a little, appraising him in- </p><p>tently. “And the terrible look in your </p><p>eyes! Oh, my poor big boy, how you must </p><p>have suffered!” </p><p> And he saw the tears of pity glisten and</p><p>wondered what to say. </p><p> “Some—some others suffered, too!” he</p><p>muttered, idiotically. </p><p> She quivered and drew a little further</p><p>away and studied him very thoughtfully, </p><p>making his heart sink by dropping his hand </p><p>and shaking her head. A stout American </p><p>gentleman in business clothes—the secre- </p><p>tary of the Board of Foreign Missions— </p><p>stepped in front of her and grasped Mc- </p><p>Todd’s listless hand and shook it; but his </p><p>smile, too, vanished as he looked into </p><p>McTodd’s somber face and he turned to the, </p><p>girl, getting a quiet nod and understand- </p><p>ing it. . </p><p> “Come, John,” requested the man,</p><p>gently, as he took one of McTodd’s arms </p><p>and the girl took the other. “Let us go to </p><p>your bungalow and talk. Come, John!” </p><p> It was a coaxing, part-commanding</p><p>voice that almost tempted the quick-acting </p><p>McTodd to show who was master right </p><p>there; but it was also a friendly voice, so </p><p>he allowed himself to be led along like a </p><p>dull child while those beside him exchanged </p><p>glances. </p><p> They ate inside the bungalow with the</p><p>secretary talking of everything but the </p><p>island and the work; and gradually </p><p>McTodd’s ear became used to the speech </p><p>of gentlefolk and his mind became saner, </p><p>as if he were starting to shake off the thrall </p><p>of a terrible nightmare. The secretary </p><p>only lost his conversational control once and </p><p>that was after McTodd had stared past </p><p>the palm trees outdoors to the sinister reef </p><p>where surf lashed about in frothing rage</p><p>like a baffled thing eternally hurled back </p><p>oy demons. </p><p> “I’ve failed!” rasped McTodd suddenly,</p><p>crashing a heavy fist on the table. “I’m </p><p>through—I’ve failed!” </p><p> His defiant eyes met the startled ones of</p><p>the others and he began to rise as if to </p><p>have it out; but the secretary tugged at his </p><p>sleeve pleadingly. </p><p> “Let us enjoy ourselves now and forget</p><p>the rest,” urged the elderly man. “Later </p><p>you can show us your island and your work </p><p>and then, perhaps, we may judge.” </p><p> McTodd took the hint and listened</p><p>patiently thereafter to the tale of the </p><p>secretary’s travels while on his tour of in- </p><p>The Seeds of Wrath </p><p>127 </p><p>spection; and later, when his hour of </p><p>paradise was over, McTodd decided with </p><p>a sigh to let his guests -see conditions for </p><p>themselves, without his telling them. Thus </p><p>he left them in the bungalow and went </p><p>below to summon his people and put them </p><p>through their paces so that his visitors could </p><p>visualize the thing. Explanations would </p><p>then be needless—and useless. </p><p>LINING up his warriors, McTodd </p><p>gave them terse directions and </p><p>went back to the bungalow and </p><p>brought his thoughtful, wondering guests </p><p>to a little knoll. He did not tell them he </p><p>was planning a queer military review, nor </p><p>did the astonished visitors have an inkling </p><p>until solid ranks of brown warriors, keeping </p><p>step, marched out of a grove of trees into </p><p>a meadow below the hill. </p><p> Subconsciously McTodd found himself</p><p>curious as to how his savages would act </p><p>under their own leaders. It was his first </p><p>chance to stand away from it all and look </p><p>over his handiwork and he was quickly </p><p>forced to admit that his cynical handiwork </p><p>was good. He even found himself owning </p><p>an apologetic vanity in the matter. </p><p> Holding weapons rigidly in their right</p><p>hands, swinging their left arms in broad </p><p>arcs like Russian grenadiers, the little </p><p>savages that McTodd had terrorized into </p><p>discipline were merged into a compact, </p><p>businesslike machine that obeyed the Eng- </p><p>lish commands of its leaders instantly. </p><p>First came Makosa, carrying the emblem. </p><p>Then the prime swordsmen swung across </p><p>the field in four ranks of twenty-odd men </p><p>each, keeping perfect alinement. Behind </p><p>them a hundred spears bobbed and flashed </p><p>in the sun, flanked on either side by bow- </p><p>men and skirmishers whose left arms </p><p>swayed rhythmically as they walked. </p><p> Some one started singing. The others</p><p>took it up and soon the chorus rolled from </p><p>rank to rank—the grand old hymn of </p><p>Christianity, quaintly distorted in the </p><p>queer, savage wording: </p><p> “On-gwa Clifton so-jass-”</p><p> McTodd glanced toward the secretary</p><p>at his left and saw the man’s jaw drooped </p><p>in petrified amazement. When he looked </p><p>around there was something like admiration </p><p>in his quizzical eyes, but McTodd quickly </p><p>shifted his glance to the girl at his right. </p><p>He only saw her straight profile. She was </p><p>staring below and on her face was a deeper </p><p>color than he had ever seen before. He </p><p>found himself trembling. </p><p> “And you have failed?” came her vibrant</p><p>voice, queerly intoned. </p><p> “Yes,” he murmured, unsteadily. “I—</p><p>I did not come here to train warriors.” </p><p>“Perhaps you had to,” she replied, “and </p><p>maybe you builded better than you knew. </p><p>Look!” She pointed a white-clad arm </p><p>toward the swinging black column that </p><p>was counter-marching. “You came here </p><p>to teach these people at least the forms of </p><p>our religion. Hear them? They are sing- </p><p>ing the song of that religion!” </p><p> She turned to him and in her eyes he saw</p><p>a great admiration and triumph, as though </p><p>he had justified all her mighty faith. </p><p> “It’s—it’s splendid!” she cried. “They</p><p>have been taught law and order. They </p><p>are clean and neat. They have learned </p><p>discipline. Why—it’s perfect! Even the </p><p>cross is ‘going on before.’ Do you see?” </p><p>And she pointed toward the fat old chief- </p><p>tain holding the emblem in his right </p><p>hand. </p><p> As if a binding had been stricken from</p><p>his eyes McTodd gasped, electrified at </p><p>what he saw. He rubbed his eyes, awake </p><p>at last. In a flash of vivid understanding </p><p>he realized that he had planted the seed he </p><p>had come to plant and opened the ground </p><p>he had come to open. He was the plow- </p><p>man. He had used dynamite because the </p><p>soil was hard; but now the top crust was </p><p>softened and those who came after him </p><p>need only be the cultivators. The children </p><p>of these savages could be friends to civiliza- </p><p>tion forevermore. McTodd knew at last </p><p>that he had not failed. </p><p> The white man’s methods had been</p><p>harsh and brutal. He had been goaded </p><p>to things unthinkable in his sane and </p><p>Christian state. He had killed. He had </p><p>denied his Creator. But now his head</p><p>bowed and tears ran unashamed down his </p><p>cheeks. </p><p> “I see it all now,” he choked. “I am</p><p>His servant after all!” </p><p> The .girl patted his shoulder tenderly.</p><p> “I know,” she agreed. “You always</p><p>were. We all are. With you it was only </p><p>a question of making these people under- </p><p>stand you.” </p><p> McTodd looked away suddenly, for he</p><p>felt the old demon of grimness gripping him </p><p>again—for the last time. </p><p> “I did,” he nodded.</p><p>MAKING GOOD </p><p> FOR MULEY</p><p> %</p><p>W.C.Tuttlo </p><p>Author of "A Prevaricated Parade"Loco or Love," etc. </p><p>F THERE’S a word of truth in </p><p>that old saying about beauty </p><p>being only skin deep Susie </p><p>Abernathy was the thinnest- </p><p>skinned person I ever saw. I may not be a </p><p>judge of womanly beauty, and the poetry </p><p>of my soul may have been shook loose by </p><p>pitching broncos, and buried deep under a </p><p>coating of alkali dust, but I sure do sabe </p><p>when a woman is hard to look at. </p><p> Seems to me like it’s human nature for a</p><p>feller with squirrel-teeth, no jaw to speak </p><p>about and a physique like a corn cultivator </p><p>to marry a beautiful female, and vice versa </p><p>—not that “Muley” Bowles qualifies in the </p><p>beauty division, but at that I reckon he </p><p>shaded Susie a little. </p><p> Muley was a poetical puncher, of con-</p><p>siderable avoirdupois, and he found Susie </p><p>a thing of beauty and a joy forever. Susie </p><p>was a niece of Zeb Abernathy, who owned </p><p>a sheep outfit on Willow Creek, and a </p><p>grouch toward all cowmen—and Muley </p><p>punched cows for the Cross J outfit, and </p><p>drew forty a month from old man </p><p>Whittaker. </p><p> I’m not belittling Muley’s salary, ’cause</p><p>I drew the same, and so did “Telescope” </p><p>Tolliver and “Chuck” Warner. Back in the </p><p>dim and distant past, when cows first </p><p>come into style, the old-timers got to- </p><p>gether and settled the pay of the average </p><p>cow-hand. </p><p> They figured that any normal puncher—</p><p>if there is such an animal—would try at least </p><p>three turns of the roulette wheel, at ten </p><p>dollars per turn. That left him ten dollars. </p><p>He’d buy some tobacco, some red neckties </p><p>and perfume, and what was left, at two-bits </p><p>a drink for hooch, would just carry him a </p><p>few inches short of the murder and sudden </p><p>death stage. </p><p> I’ve just been up to the house to draw my</p><p>stipend from the old man, and am on my</p><p>way back to the bunk-house, when Muley </p><p>rides in. He’s humped over in his saddle, </p><p>like Misery going to a cemetery, and if you </p><p>can stamp despair on a full-sized milk- </p><p>cheese he had it on his face. </p><p> He slips his saddle off, turns his bronc</p><p>into the corral, leans against the fence and </p><p>cuts loose the granddaddy of all sighs. </p><p>There ain’t many men that you can hear </p><p>sigh at pointblank range for a .30-30, but </p><p>you could with Muley. It was like re- </p><p>leasing the air on a freight train. </p><p> I wanders down there and passes the time</p><p>of day with him, but he don’t respond. He </p><p>exhausts deep into his soul once more, and </p><p>hangs up his saddle. </p><p> “Some of your relatives die, Muley?”</p><p>I asks. </p><p> “Hello, Hen,” says he, sad-like, “I ain’t</p><p>got no relatives—except one aunt. I don’t </p><p>know whether she’s alive or not.” </p><p> “Name of Bowles?”</p><p> “Nope. Name’s Allender. Maw’s name</p><p>was Allender, and that’s why I was named </p><p>Making Good for Muley </p><p>129 </p><p>Lemule Allender, and—what do you want </p><p>to know for?” </p><p> “You sighed a couple of times,” I reminds</p><p>him, and he nods and looks off across the </p><p>range. </p><p> “Henry, how can I make some money?</p><p>Regular money. I can’t get along on forty </p><p>a month—no more.” </p><p> “You aim to marry Susie Abernathy?”</p><p>I asks. </p><p> Muley digs a little trench with the</p><p>toe of his boot, and shakes his head, sad- </p><p>like— </p><p> “No-o-o, I reckon not, Hen.”</p><p> “Just come from there?” I asks.</p><p> “Uh-huh. Listen, Hen: can you keep a</p><p>secret? I know danged well that you can’t, </p><p>but I got to talk to somebody. Me and </p><p>Susie’s got it all framed up to get married, </p><p>but she argues that I got to see Zeb. Susie </p><p>ain’t of age yet, and Zeb is her guardian. </p><p>Sabe? </p><p> “Believe me, Henry, if I owned a peni-</p><p>tentiary I’d hire Zeb. I’d a killed him a </p><p>long time ago if it wasn’t for Susie, ’cause </p><p>no sheep-man can tell me where to head in </p><p>at—dang his old billy-goat face! He’s a </p><p>darned-” </p><p> “Not to change the subject, Muley,” says</p><p>I, “but why don’t you ask him?” </p><p> “I did. Do you think I’d feel this way</p><p>over futures? You’re dam well right I </p><p>asked him! Know what he said? He said </p><p>to me, just like this: ‘Mister Bowles, you </p><p>keep away from Miss Abernathy. She’s </p><p>got her sights set higher than a forty-dollar </p><p>puncher.’ </p><p> “That’s what he said, Henry, and then</p><p>I said: ‘Mister Abernathy, you’re tilting </p><p>that gun for her: let her do her own shoot- </p><p>ing,” and he said, ‘Your reputation ain’t </p><p>none too good, and if the Vigilantes ever </p><p>organize here Susie would be a widow.’ </p><p>‘You wouldn’t know it,’ says I, ‘ ’cause</p><p>they’d get you first.’ </p><p> “Muley,” says I, “which one of you shot</p><p>first?” </p><p> “Neither one. I beat him on the draw,</p><p>but you can’t kill your sweetheart’s guard- </p><p>ian. It ain’t ethical, Hen. He told me </p><p>that any old time I could show enough </p><p>money to buy out his herd I could have </p><p>Susie. I told him I wasn’t in the habit of </p><p>buying either sheep or wives, and he said </p><p>he knowed that without me telling him. </p><p>Said that no forty-a-month puncher was </p><p>ever that foolish.” </p><p>9 </p><p> “How about Susie—does she love you,</p><p>Muley?” </p><p> “Uh-huh,” he sighs, “she sure does. I</p><p>don’t know how she can, but she does.” </p><p> “I don’t know either, Muley, but it takes</p><p>all kinds of folks to make a world.” </p><p> “I been thinking of marriage for a long</p><p>time,” he sighs, “I been afraid to ask her, </p><p>but today she up and kissed me, and that </p><p>settled it, Hen. Funny what a little kiss </p><p>will do thataway. It makes me desperate.” </p><p>“It would have done the same to me, </p><p>Muley. If a girl like her kissed me I’d </p><p>likely turn outlaw. You aim to go to </p><p>Chicago with that train of cows?” </p><p> “I can’t, Hen. I hope the old man don’t</p><p>ask me to. You going?” </p><p> “No. Telescope and Chuck are going,</p><p>but the old man wants me to act as foreman </p><p>while they’re gone—he’s going, too. I’ll </p><p>ask him to let you stay, if you want me to, </p><p>Muley.” </p><p> “I’d love you like a brother, Hen,” he</p><p>sighs, “I want to be near her.” </p><p> That’s Muley. Being of a poetical tem-</p><p>perament he has to confide in folks. If me </p><p>or Telescope or Chuck got kissed by a lady </p><p>we’d cherish the memory to our graves— </p><p>unless it was Susie, and think of it only </p><p>when alone. </p><p> I ain’t so bad to look upon, and a lady</p><p>couldn’t be censured for giving me a kiss,</p><p>but when it comes to Telescope and </p><p>Chuck—well, I suppose they’ll eventually </p><p>marry beautiful women. </p><p> Telescope is built like a bed-slat, and</p><p>orates openly that he’s a twig of the </p><p>Tolliver tree, which flourished and bought </p><p>colored help in Kentucky before the plans </p><p>were drawn for the pyramids. Chuck </p><p>Warner don’t claim nothing, and don’t get </p><p>sore if you subtract from his ancestry. He </p><p>was bom west of the Arizona line, and if he </p><p>descended from anybody it was Ananias. </p><p> Chuck’s legs are as short as his memory,</p><p>and he was born with the face of a horse </p><p>and the trusting eyes of an angel. He never </p><p>told the truth but once. A big feller, from </p><p>down below Mesquite, took him down and </p><p>bumped his head on the ground. </p><p> “You got enough?” asks the big person,</p><p>and Chuck howls— </p><p> “Plenty!”</p><p> “You ain’t lying, are you?” asks the</p><p>feller, after he lets Chuck up. </p><p> Chuck brushes off his clothes and shakes</p><p>his sore head: </p><p>130 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “No! Dang it all! I wasn’t in no position</p><p>to lie about it!” </p><p>MULEY told me that I couldn’t </p><p>keep a secret, and I didn’t. Me and </p><p>Chuck and Telescope rides to town </p><p>that afternoon, to foiler out the usual </p><p>program expected of punchers with a </p><p>month’s pay aboard, and I tells them </p><p>about Muley’s troubles. </p><p> “He’s more to be censured than pitied,”</p><p>admits Chuck. “I don’t blame Zeb, but </p><p>I do hate a shepherd what thinks a puncher </p><p>ain’t good enough for his relatives.” </p><p> “Poor Muley,” says Telescope, sad-like,</p><p>“any man what is just one aunt shy of being </p><p>an orphan has my sympathy. I’ll promise </p><p>you, Hen, that I’ll do all I can.” </p><p> “In Muley’s name I thanks you,” says I,</p><p>“but if you can’t do it for Muley don’t do </p><p>it on my account. I ain’t going to marry </p><p>her. I just feel sorry for him. I’d feel </p><p>sorry for anybody what was in love with </p><p>Susie.” </p><p> “She ain’t exactly of the vampire type,”</p><p>agrees Chuck. “Muley’s got one dead </p><p>immortal cinch though: nobody’s going to </p><p>come along and steal her away from him.” </p><p>“Zeb says he’ll have to marry her over </p><p>his dead body or bring money enough to </p><p>buy out his sheep,” says I. </p><p> “The latter is the more revolting,” says</p><p>Telescope. “Tell Muley we’ll fix it for him </p><p>after we get back if we have to steal Zeb’s </p><p>sheep so he won’t have nothing to sell.” </p><p>The next few days we’re a busy crew, </p><p>loading twenty cars of beef for Chicago, </p><p>and we don’t have much time for con- </p><p>versation. Muley is too fat to herd ’em </p><p>up the chute, so he sets down cross-legged </p><p>on top of a car, and checks off the loads. </p><p>Zeb Abernathy comes over to the yards and </p><p>sets down on top of the fence, along with </p><p>a lot of other loafers, and when Telescope </p><p>sees him he crosses the corral and sets down </p><p>beside Zeb. </p><p> “Howdy, Zeb,” says Telescope, rolling a</p><p>smoke. “You going to leave here after </p><p>you sells out, or are you going to make your</p><p>home with Susie and her husband?” </p><p> “Hu-u-u-u-h?” grunts Zeb, amazed-like,</p><p>“what’s that you said?” </p><p> “Haw, haw, haw!” laughed Telescope, slap-</p><p>ping Zeb on the back. “You can’t keep </p><p>things like that a secret around here, old- </p><p>timer. What’ll we bring to the charivari— </p><p>sheep-shears or tin cans?” </p><p> Zeb sets there, working his jaws faster</p><p>and faster over his tobacco, and pretty soon </p><p>he looks up at Muley. Muley grins at him, </p><p>and nods. That’s the last straw. </p><p> “Muley’s going to buy out Zeb and marry</p><p>his niece,” states Telescope to Johnny </p><p>Myers, owner of the Triangle brand. </p><p>“Muley’s going to be a sheep-king, Johnny.” </p><p>All this time Zeb has been getting off the </p><p>fence, and he’s so mad that he dances a jig </p><p>in the dust when he hits the ground. </p><p> “Ya-a-a-a-ah!” he whoops, waving his</p><p>long arms like a swarm of bees was after </p><p>him. “Telescope Tolliver, you’re a liar if </p><p>you think it! Marry that fat, forty-dollar </p><p>fool! Buy my herd! Say, he ain’t never </p><p>had money enough to buy a woo! sock! </p><p>Ya-a-a-a-ah! You think you’re funny, </p><p>don’t you?” </p><p> “Ya-a-a-ah!” mimics Chuck, wiggling his</p><p>ears. “Zebbie, you’re learning. Now the </p><p>chorus—ba-a-a-a-a-ah! ’ ’ </p><p> Zeb’s feelings can’t stand no more, so</p><p>he turns around like a man with a sore </p><p>throat, and goes back toward town stiff- </p><p>legged like a bear with a peeve on. </p><p> “Zeb loves you fellers,” laughs Johnny.</p><p>“I heard him say this morning that there’s </p><p>just five things he hates. One is a rattle- </p><p>snake and the other four draws a salary </p><p>from Whittaker. What’s he sore at you </p><p>fellers for? Has the sheep affected his </p><p>brain?” </p><p> “Such a theory is absurd, Jolmny,” says</p><p>I. “It can’t be proved, ’cause nobody with </p><p>brains ever mixes up with sheep. You </p><p>can’t corrupt a coyote.” </p><p> A little later on me and Muley are setting</p><p>on the fence, when Telescope climbs up </p><p>beside us and talks to Muley like a father.</p><p>“You realize what this here marriage </p><p>stuff means, Muley?” he asks. “You sure </p><p>you ain’t just sick like a calf for it’s maw?” </p><p>“I know my own heart, liver and lights, </p><p>Telescope,” replies Muley. </p><p> “Really love her with all your heart and</p><p>soul, eh? Say, I’ll bet you’d turn her down </p><p>cold if it was to your advantage.” </p><p> “You dang well know I wouldn’t!</p><p>“Suppose,” says Telescope, “suppose </p><p>somebody said to you: ‘Muley, I’ll give you </p><p>a year’s salary if you’ll keep away from </p><p>Susie? What would you do?” </p><p> “Me? I’d rise up on my hind legs</p><p>and inform him that my love ain’t </p><p>for sale. Sabe? Not for the salary of a </p><p>lifetime.” </p><p>Making Good for Muley </p><p>131 </p><p> Telescope thinks it over for a while, and</p><p>then shakes his head, sad-like: </p><p>' “Maybe you would, Muley. I sure </p><p>hopes you gets them sheep, ’cause you </p><p>qualifies for the shepherd class without no </p><p>fixing. I’ve read about love making a fool </p><p>out of a man, but—well, it ain’t no funeral </p><p>of mine.” </p><p> That night we shakes hands with Tele-</p><p>scope and Chuck and the old man, and </p><p>wishes them many happy returns of the </p><p>day. </p><p> “Don’t give up the ship, Muley,” advises</p><p>Telescope. “Do a lot of thinking while </p><p>we’re gone, and if you can figure out any </p><p>way of making money, without robbing a </p><p>bank, me and Chuck will put her over for </p><p>you, eh, Chuck?” </p><p> “A stiff upper lip gathers no mustache,”</p><p>proclaims Chuck, “and a faint heart never </p><p>rustled no sheep, Muley. So-long, you </p><p>pitch-fork puncher. And, Ilen-ree, don’t </p><p>fall in love. One shepherd in the family is a </p><p>plenty.” </p><p> Me and Muley rides back to the ranch,</p><p>but Muley ain’t got much to say. Love </p><p>is a queer little animal, and affects folks </p><p>different. Muley’s was the dark-blue vari- </p><p>ety, with circles around the eyes. </p><p> The next morning after breakfast Muley</p><p>gets a sheet of paper and a pencil, and seems </p><p>to compose deep-like. After a while he cuts </p><p>loose a deep sigh, and looks, dreamy-like, </p><p>at the ceiling. </p><p> “I’m here,” says I. “Can I help you in</p><p>any way, Muley?” </p><p> “I’ve got it,” he sighs. “You can’t</p><p>appreciate it, ’cause you ain’t got no finer </p><p>feelings, but I’ll recite it to you: </p><p> “I loved a darling angel,</p><p> And she loved me quite a lot.</p><p> Her ears are like the clam shell,</p><p> And I can forget her not.</p><p> She’s doomed to marry money,</p><p> And my heart will break, I think,</p><p> If I don’t wed this angel,</p><p> I will drown myself in drink.”</p><p> “Nice sentiment,” I applauded. “Bob-</p><p>by Burns never had nothing on you except </p><p>the long sound of his r’s, but you’ll have </p><p>to put off your demise for at least another </p><p>month. You can’t do an artistic job of </p><p>drownding in a couple of dollars’ worth </p><p>of hooch. If you was to get in over your </p><p>depth in liquor, Muley, what brand would </p><p>you prefer?” </p><p> Right then Muley gets sore at me. I</p><p>finds that you can josh a man about love </p><p>just so far, and then he turns like a worm </p><p>and tries to bite me. </p><p> FOR the next few days he writes</p><p>RfraJ poetry in the evening, and is absent </p><p>most all day. He ain’t a pleasant </p><p>critter to talk to, so I spends most of my </p><p>time playing solitaire. One day down in </p><p>Paradise I runs across Susie. </p><p> “Seen Muley lately?” I asks, and she</p><p>shakes her head. </p><p> “No. Uncle Zeb ordered him off the</p><p>ranch, and since then I’ve only seen him </p><p>at a distance. He—he said he was going </p><p>to try and convince uncle that he’s some- </p><p>thing more than an ordinary cowboy. Do </p><p>you think he can, Mister Peck?” </p><p> “Not unless uncle loses his sense of sight.</p><p>Muley is pining away, day by day, and </p><p>unless something comes up to relieve the </p><p>situation he’ll be able to go through a door </p><p>without turning the knob. I know this </p><p>is a leading question, Miss Abernathy, but </p><p>would you marry that Lemuel Bowles if you </p><p>had a good chance?” </p><p> “Why—er—uh-huh,” says she, nodding</p><p>her head brave-like, while her ears get hot </p><p>enough to light a cigaret on. </p><p> “I feel sorry for Muley,” says I, letting</p><p>her take it any way she wants to, and then </p><p>I lopes away, ’cause I sees Zeb coming.</p><p> The next morning we ain’t no more than</p><p>out of bed when in rides old Paddy Morse. </p><p>Paddy runs the post-office, along with his </p><p>little store, and this is the first time I ever </p><p>seen him at the Cross J. </p><p> “Is Le-mule Allender Bowles to home?”</p><p>he inquires, peering over his specs at me. </p><p> “Right here, Paddy,” says Muley.</p><p>“What do you want?” </p><p> “Letter for you. Reckon it’s for you,</p><p>’cause there ain’t no other Bowles around </p><p>this here neck of the woods. You got to </p><p>sign your full name, same as on that letter </p><p>or I can’t let you have it. Sabe? </p><p> “This here is a special delivery letter—</p><p>darn such things! Uncle Sam forces me </p><p>to ride plumb up here to deliver this or take </p><p>the consequences, which I believe is three </p><p>hundred days in jail or a year—sign right </p><p>on that line. Now, I reckon I’ll go on back. </p><p>Hope it ain’t bad news, Muley. Mostly </p><p>always a letter of that kind or a telegram </p><p>means death. Come from Milwaukee. </p><p>You got any kin in Milwaukee?” </p><p> But Muley has gone back into the house,</p><p>132 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>and Paddy don’t get the information he </p><p>seeks. </p><p> About fifteen minutes later Muley comes</p><p>down to the bunk-house, where I’m putting </p><p>some rosettes on a new bridle, and he’s got a </p><p>grin plumb across his fat face. I glances at </p><p>him and goes on working. </p><p> “Henry,” says he, after a little while,</p><p>“would you like to have a job herding my </p><p>sheep?” </p><p> “Your sheep? Sure. I’ll herd all you got</p><p>in my sleep.” </p><p> “I’m going to be the richest man in Yaller</p><p>Rock County,” he proclaims. </p><p> “You better talk lower, Muley,” I ad-</p><p>vises. “If the county commissioners hear </p><p>you talk thataway they’ll way-bill you to </p><p>the loco-lodge at Warm Springs.” </p><p> “You remember me telling you about</p><p>my Aunt Agnes, Hen? She died.” </p><p> “And left you a sheep?” I asks.</p><p> “Sheep—always sheep! Take a look at</p><p>this.” </p><p> He hands me a letter—the one what</p><p>Paddy brought him, and I looks her over. </p><p>The brand opines it to be from Milwaukee, </p><p>and the top of the letter proclaims that </p><p>Frederick &amp; Quincy are lawyers. She listens </p><p>something like this: </p><p>Dear Sir: </p><p> It grieves us to inform you that your aunt, Miss</p><p>Agnes AUender, of this city, died on the fifth day </p><p>Df August, 1900. </p><p> According to her last will and testament, you,</p><p>which she designates as her favorite nephew, will </p><p>inherit the bulk of her estate, which is valued at </p><p>about one hundred thousand dollars. </p><p> As you likely know she was a very eccentric</p><p>person, and her will imposes you as follows: without </p><p>receiving a cent of said inheritance you must, before </p><p>the fifteenth day of August, 1900, have invested </p><p>four-fifths of said hundred thousand dollars in</p><p>sheep. </p><p> She also designates that: the said Lemuel</p><p>AJlender Bowles must not marry for the space of </p><p>five years under penalty of forfeiture of entire </p><p>inheritance. Also that he take a care for Alfred </p><p>and Amelia for the rest of their natural lives. All </p><p>of the foregoing requests must be complied with </p><p>or my estate is to be divided between charitable </p><p>institutions aforementioned in my will. </p><p> On the fifteenth day of August, 1900, our repre-</p><p>sentative will call on you and examine your invest- </p><p>ments. We wish you luck. </p><p> I hands it back to him, and goes on</p><p>working. </p><p> “Well,” says he, sort of choking-like,”</p><p>don’t I get congratulated?” </p><p> “As soon as I gets time I’m going to feel</p><p>sorry for you, Muley. How in thunder </p><p>can you invest eighty thousand dollars </p><p>around here, when everybody knows you </p><p>ain’t got a cent, and everybody hates sheep. </p><p>You can’t get married for five years, and </p><p>you’ve got to feed, water and groom Alfred </p><p>and Amelia all the rest of their natural lives. </p><p>Wonder what them twin-sounding things </p><p>are, Muley?” </p><p> Muley sets to thinking it over, and folding</p><p>and unfolding that letter: </p><p> “Since you sympathized with me, things</p><p>don’t look so rosy,” he admits, with a deep </p><p>sigh. “Reckon I missed that marrying </p><p>part. If Alfred and Amelia got a fair start </p><p>they ought ,to be about due. Reckon I’ll </p><p>ride down to Paradise—dang the luck! </p><p>I’ve torn that letter plumb in two!” </p><p> He puts the two pieces in his vest pocket</p><p>and goes off down to the corral. </p><p> The longer I thinks things over the</p><p>harder it looks for Muley. Muley ain’t </p><p>got the reputation of a saint around here, </p><p>and can’t even lie so folks will believe him. </p><p>Zeb owns all the visible supply of sheep, </p><p>and Muley ain’t got no time to spare if he’s </p><p>going to make good. </p><p> Along about noon Muley rides in. He’s</p><p>got a big bundle under one arm and a big </p><p>box under the other. He deposits his</p><p>plunder on the steps, and sets down. I sets </p><p>down beside him to wait until he gets </p><p>through sighing, when all to once a squeaky </p><p>voice yells: </p><p> “Way ’round ’em, Shep! Who’s crazy!”</p><p>I hops plumb off the steps, and whirls </p><p>with my gun ready. Muley looks at me, </p><p>sad-like, and sighs again—■ </p><p> “That’s Alfred, Henry.”</p><p> “Alfred?” I asks. “Alfred who?”</p><p> “I don’t know. Nobody introduced me,</p><p>but it don’t matter—Alfred is a parrot.” </p><p>“Oh!” says I, “what’s Amelia—a lady </p><p>bug?” </p><p> “Naw-w-w! Cat.”</p><p> “Squr-r-r-r-reek! Sheep dip! Sheep dip!</p><p>Har, har, liar! Squr-r-reekl” announces </p><p>Alfred. </p><p> “Hen, what’s the natural life of a parrot?”</p><p>asks Muley, without lifting his head. </p><p> “I don’t know. Why the question?”</p><p>“That letter specifies ‘natural lifetime.’ </p><p>That’s the joker.” </p><p> “Did it say that?”</p><p> “Sure did. Wait, I’ll show you.” He</p><p>fumbles around in his pockets for a while, </p><p>and then looks foolish-like at me: “The </p><p>front half of that letter is gone, Henry! </p><p>Making Good for Muley </p><p>133 </p><p>Now, where in thunder did I drop that?” </p><p> He hunts some more but his pockets don’t</p><p>essay a trace. </p><p> “Har, har, har! Way ’round ’em, Shep!”</p><p>shrieks Alfred, and Muley kicks the cage </p><p>off the porch. </p><p> “Shut up! You cross between a duck</p><p>and a phonygraph! You ain’t yelped </p><p>nothing but sheep-talk since I got you. No </p><p>wonder Aunt Agnes died—she must have </p><p>had ticks!” </p><p> “You ain’t showing proper respect for</p><p>the dead, Muley,” I reminds him. </p><p> “Is that so!” he yelps. “Is that so!</p><p>Well, dog-gone it, Hen, she didn’t show no </p><p>respect for the living when she shipped me </p><p>these trinkets, did she? Sending a puncher </p><p>a sheep-talking buzzard ain’t showing a </p><p>whole lot of respect. That cat is so old </p><p>I’ll have to feed it on a bottle, and-•” </p><p> “Sheep dip!” screams Alfred. “Who’s</p><p>crazy?” </p><p> Muley throws his coat over the cage,</p><p>and slams the whole works into the house. </p><p>He follers it inside, and I sets there for a </p><p>while thinking things over. The slats on </p><p>Amelia’s home arfi’t none too secure, so I </p><p>loosens one end, and as I goes inside the </p><p>bunk-house I sees Amelia trotting off </p><p>toward the barn. </p><p> Muley comes down after a while and sets</p><p>down on the bunk. “Alfred danged near </p><p>bit my finger off, and Amelia’s made her </p><p>getaway, Hen,” he announces in a sad </p><p>voice. “Amelia was down there on the </p><p>corral fence, making faces at Chuck’s </p><p>coyote pup, and she offers fight when I </p><p>tries to calm her spirits. Aunt Agnes must </p><p>have been a nut over ferocious animals.” </p><p> “Nevertheless she was your mother’s</p><p>sister, and left you all her wealth,” I chides </p><p>him. </p><p> “Yah! Like throwing both ends of a rope</p><p>to a drownding man, and forgetting to hang </p><p>on to the middle. Can’t marry for five—</p><p>huh!” </p><p> He gets up and stomps out of the place,</p><p>and I opines that Muley’s inheritance is </p><p>beginning to bear down upon his immortal </p><p>soul. </p><p>THE next day Hank Padden, who </p><p>owns the Seven A outfit, shows up, </p><p>and sets down with me in the parlor. </p><p>Muley is washing up, and when Hank asks </p><p>for him he yells that he’ll be out in a minute. </p><p> “I’m going to make Muley an offer,” says</p><p>Hank to me, confident-like. “I hears that </p><p>he’s going to get married, and I needs a </p><p>foreman what is a married man. Sabe? </p><p>Single men ain’t got nothing to hold ’em </p><p>down. I like Muley—dang his fat carcass </p><p>—and I rides over here to see him.” </p><p> “Uh-huh,” says I, ’cause there ain’t</p><p>nothing else to say, and then Hank yells </p><p>at Muley: </p><p> “Come out here, you half-ton puncher!</p><p>I want to talk to you about-” </p><p> “Sheep dip! Sheep dip! Har, har, har!”</p><p>I know it’s Alfred, but if it don’t sound </p><p>like Muley I’ll eat my quirt. Same little </p><p>wheeze that Muley has in his laugh. </p><p> Hank comes to his feet like a shot, and</p><p>glares at the half-closed door. He puts </p><p>on his hat, walks straight out of the door, </p><p>gets on his bronc and fogs away from the </p><p>Cross J. </p><p> I hears a crash in the next room, a couple</p><p>of shrieks, and out comes Alfred with most </p><p>of his tail feathers missing. He sails </p><p>around the room a couple of times, finally </p><p>hits the open door, and perches on the hitch- </p><p>rack in front of the house. </p><p> Muley comes out, with a shotgun in his</p><p>hand, and glares around. </p><p> “Natural lifetime, Muley,” I informs</p><p>him, and he tosses the gun on the sofa. </p><p> “That bird will be the death of me,</p><p>Henry!” he wails, “yelping sheep-talk at </p><p>Hank Padden is like lighting a cigaret with </p><p>a stick of dynamite. What did he want</p><p>of me?” </p><p> “He came over to sympathize with you</p><p>about your aunt.” </p><p> “Oh!” says Muley, blank-like, looking</p><p>out of the window. “Ain’t this Wick </p><p>Smith coming?” </p><p> It was Wick. He ties his bronc and</p><p>comes inside. To hear him talk you’d </p><p>think that rheumatism had typhoid-pneu- </p><p>monia and bubonic plague beat so far that </p><p>you could cure ’em both with internal </p><p>applications of peach pie. </p><p> “I got to get away from here,” states</p><p>Wick, after we discusses the weather a </p><p>while. “Every season I lives here brings </p><p>me that much nearer the grave. I want </p><p>to take a pardner into my store, and while </p><p>I ain’t decided exactly about it, I comes </p><p>up here to have a talk with Muley. I needs </p><p>new blood in my place, and I got to have a </p><p>married man, which has a little money. </p><p>Sabe?”	J</p><p> “You got any sheep?” I asks.</p><p>134 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Wick sets up straight and glares at me.</p><p> “Sheep? I’m a merchant—not a shep-</p><p>herd!” </p><p> “Wool is good for rheumatism,” says I,</p><p>offhand-like, trying to smooth over my </p><p>mistake. </p><p> “If you’re looking for a married man with</p><p>money you sure got into the wrong pew, </p><p>Mister Smith,” states Muley. </p><p> “Zeb told me that you had an aunt—”</p><p>begins Wick, wise-like, and then: </p><p> Squr-r-r-r-reekl Meo-o-o-o-o-ow! Yip,</p><p>yip, yip! </p><p> First comes Amelia. She’s traveling so</p><p>blamed fast that she looks like a string of </p><p>about six cats. Right behind her comes </p><p>that coyote pup, digging deep into his soul </p><p>for joyful sounds, and behind him, screech- </p><p>ing and screaming comes Alfred, and they </p><p>invades the parlor. </p><p> Wick hops to his feet as they enters, and</p><p>of course he’s the highest point in the room. </p><p>A cat will always hit for elevation—there- </p><p>fore Wick got Amelia. Me and Muley </p><p>sort of draws back to keep the score, but </p><p>things happens too fast for computation. </p><p>Amelia draws all four feet together in Wick’s </p><p>scalp, the same of which makes Wick </p><p>wrinkle up his face, and forget the rheuma- </p><p>tism in his legs. The bird and the coyote </p><p>don’t do much except cut circles until Wick </p><p>starts, blind-like to leave there, and falls </p><p>over a chair. </p><p> Wick turns over once, lands on his hands</p><p>and knees, and pilgrims out of the door, </p><p>with the cat prospecting his dandruff, </p><p>Alfred hopping up and down on his back, </p><p>and the coyote pup hanging on to his coat- </p><p>tails, and skidding along, making little </p><p>snappy barks of delight. </p><p> They all rolls off the porch, where the</p><p>three animals tangles up, leaving Wick </p><p>alone. He forks his bronc in a hurry, and </p><p>sets there rubbing the haze out of his eyes. </p><p> Amelia is setting a new cross-country</p><p>record for cats, as she hunts for a high spot, </p><p>and the pup is singing along right behind </p><p>her. </p><p> Alfred walks circles around a post for a</p><p>few seconds, and then flutters to the top of </p><p>the hitch-rack. He ruffles up what feathers </p><p>he’s got left, cocks his head on one side and </p><p>screeches: </p><p> “Har, har, har! Sheep dip! Who’s</p><p>crazy?” </p><p> “My gosh!” explodes Wick. “That cy-</p><p>clone hit me so hard that I can see green </p><p>eagles and hear ’em talk!” and he backs his </p><p>bronc away, cautious-like, and leaves us in </p><p>a hurry. </p><p> Me and Muley looks at each other for a</p><p>while, and then Muley yawns: </p><p> “I must have lost that piece of letter</p><p>where Zeb could find it. Well, it didn’t </p><p>say nothing about buying sheep, anyway. </p><p>Hen.” </p><p> “Lucky it didn’t, Muley. If the com-</p><p>munity thought you intended to bring </p><p>eighty thousand dollars’ worth of sheep on </p><p>to this range you’d be the honored guest </p><p>at a cravat party. Your auntie didn’t </p><p>understand conditions when she wrote that </p><p>will, Muley.” </p><p> “Why emphasize ‘when she wrote that</p><p>will,’ Henry!” he asks, sad-like. “After </p><p>looking at Alfred and Amelia—well, Henry, </p><p>there’s a destiny what shapes our ends.” </p><p>Next morning at breakfast we’re inter- </p><p>rupted. Comes a thump of feet outside </p><p>the door, and a voice yells— </p><p> “Hello, the house!”</p><p> “Hello the-!” says I. “That sounds</p><p>like Zeb Abernathy, Muley.” </p><p> Muley steps over and picks up the old</p><p>man’s shotgun. </p><p> “Let him in, Henry,” says he. “If he</p><p>comes on the prod I’ll scatter his remains </p><p>to the four winds. </p><p> I opens the door, and the old pelican</p><p>bows to me like I was the fourth king in the </p><p>deck to enter his hand. </p><p> “Howdy, Henry,” says he, and then he</p><p>happens to see Muley with the shotgun. </p><p>“I comes in sorrow not in anger,” he states, </p><p>“my soul is filled with contrition.” </p><p> “As long as she’s filled with something</p><p>I’ll save my buckshot,” opines Muley. </p><p>“Come on in and rest your ticks, Zeb </p><p>Abernathy.” </p><p> “Nice weather,” observes Zeb, mopping</p><p>his face with a red handkerchief. “May </p><p>rain and it may not. I kind of look for a </p><p>dry spell.” </p><p> “The Weather Bureau at Washington</p><p>gets out annual reports, which reach us too </p><p>late, so we thanks you for the information,” </p><p>says Muley. </p><p> “I hope I see you both well,” opines Zeb.</p><p>“Your eyesight don’t worry me none to </p><p>speak about,” states Muley. “The last </p><p>time I meets up with you I made you throw </p><p>your gun down the well. How’s your </p><p>sentiments concerning me at present?” </p><p>“I’m filled with meekness and contrition, </p><p>Making Good for Muley </p><p>135 </p><p>as I aforementioned, Le-mule. It aches </p><p>my heart to know that I provoked you </p><p>thataway, and I pilgrims over here to make </p><p>amends. Sabe?” </p><p> “Why this sudden change of attitude?”</p><p>inquires Muley, and Zeb sort of squirms in </p><p>his chair. </p><p> “She comes to me like a yelp in the</p><p>night,” says he, pious-like, “I gets to think- </p><p>ing thusly: ‘Le-mule Allender Bowles, I </p><p>ain’t treated you right. I hops on to you </p><p>like a coyote on a carcass, and reviles you </p><p>abusive-like, ’cause you desires to marry </p><p>into my family. I lets my interest in Susie </p><p>blind me to her best interests, but now I </p><p>sheds the scales off my eyes, and comes out </p><p>into the sunshine of true understanding.’ </p><p>“The more I thinks about it, Le-mule, </p><p>the worse I feels. Youth calls to youth, </p><p>and what is stronger than the call of true </p><p>love? She ain’t never yelped at me, boys, </p><p>but I’m a heap wise. While Le-mule is </p><p>only getting forty a month now, I feels </p><p>that in the due course of time he’ll be a </p><p>shining light of the community, and maybe </p><p>go to Congress.” </p><p> “Good sentiments, Zeb,” I agrees, “but</p><p>it will likely be a close race between the </p><p>voters and the sheriff to decide whether </p><p>he goes to Helena or Deer Lodge.” </p><p> “Haw! Haw!. Haw!” roars Zeb. “Muley</p><p>will never go to the penitentiary.” </p><p> “Not willingly,” I agrees. “What are</p><p>your sheep worth today?” </p><p> “I have no sheep, Henry,” he grins.</p><p>“Sold out to a feller from St. Marie’s basin, </p><p>and his drive started today. Yep. I’m a </p><p>civilian now.” </p><p> “Got a good price, too,” he grins, when</p><p>he sees me look foolish-like at Muley. </p><p>“Glad I sold. Too much sentiment against </p><p>sheep. Well, boys, I reckon I’ll toddle </p><p>along. I couldn’t sleep until I comes over </p><p>and squares myself with Le-mule. Come </p><p>over and make yourself to home at my </p><p>place, Le-mule.” </p><p> “Thanks, Zeb-uleon,” says Muley,” I</p><p>may do that little thing, Zeb-uleon. How’s </p><p>Susie, Zeb-uleon?” </p><p> “Tolable, Le-mule. She’s pining.”</p><p> We watches him ride away, and then</p><p>Muley spits, reflectively: </p><p> “Henry, if that old pelican had called</p><p>me Le-mule once more I’d have slaughtered </p><p>him. He must have found that letter I </p><p>lost.” </p><p> “You ought to invest your money in a</p><p>detective agency, and run it yourself. I </p><p>suppose you’ll go over to see Susie?” </p><p> “Dang well know I will! Why not?”</p><p> “Go ahead. Go ahead, Muley, and lose</p><p>a hundred thousand. What’s a fortune </p><p>beside her? Your brain ain’t big enough, </p><p>Muley. When it gets over forty dollars </p><p>it all looks alike to you. You take my </p><p>advice and buy sheep.” </p><p> “Yah-h-h-h!” he blats. “Where?”</p><p> “What will you give me if I buy ’em for</p><p>you?” I asks. </p><p> “You? You got a dead aunt, too,</p><p>Henry?” </p><p> “No, but* I got brains, and I can buy</p><p>sheep.” </p><p> “Go buy ’em then!” he snaps, “I’m from</p><p>Missouri—me.” </p><p>MULEY rides away in the general </p><p>direction of his heart’s desire, and </p><p>I gets an inspiration. Over in St. </p><p>Marie’s basin is plenty of sheep, and I never </p><p>saw a sheep-man yet what wouldn’t sell out. </p><p>I like Muley. Dog-gone his irresponsible </p><p>heart, I like him. His mind ain’t big </p><p>enough to contemplate a hundred thousand </p><p>dollars, and I feels glad for him that he’s </p><p>got a friend like me to make good for him. </p><p> I may be rewarded for my efforts, and</p><p>maybe not, but anyway I’ve always wanted </p><p>to handle big money, and show to the world </p><p>that Henry Peck could be more than he’s </p><p>ever showed.</p><p> I saddles up Glory and puts a pack on</p><p>Blazer, and leaves a note for Muley, </p><p>telling him that I’ll be back on the fatal </p><p>day to save him from ruin. Little Henry </p><p>is going to be a hero, and hopes to do his </p><p>heroing on a commission basis. </p><p> I pilgrims over into a country that cow-</p><p>men designates as being a fair example of </p><p>the place where sinners will reside in the </p><p>hereafter, and eats mutton and talks sheep. </p><p> Believe me I could talk sheep faster than</p><p>the men that owned the herds, and I con- </p><p>fides in ’em about Muley’s inheritance. Of </p><p>course I didn’t tell it all, but anyway I got </p><p>options on enough sheep to cause Yaller </p><p>Rock County to build an extra wing on </p><p>the insane asylum, and said options didn’t </p><p>cost me a cent. </p><p> “Old Testament” Tilton rides back with</p><p>me. I’ve spent about fifteen thousand of </p><p>Muley’s credit with him, and being a minis- </p><p>ter, he’s a little suspicious of his fellow-men. </p><p> “I ride with you for the good of my soul,”</p><p>136 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>orates the old boy, when he offers to accom- </p><p>pany me. </p><p> I reckon that when a shepherd goes into</p><p>cow-land, it’s like taking a ship into fresh </p><p>water to knock off the barnacles. </p><p> He’s a queer old coot. Imagine a man</p><p>of his cognomen, add the smell of sheep, </p><p>dress him up around the neck like a </p><p>preacher, tuck his pants into the top of a </p><p>pair of heavy boots, and you’ve got a </p><p>portrait of Old Testament. He rides a </p><p>little calico bronc, with one cropped ear </p><p>and a rat-tail, and calls it Ebenezer. The </p><p>only way, I figure, that he could ever hand </p><p>out salvation would be by correspondence. </p><p> “Now, this here Le-mule Bowles,” re-</p><p>marks the old boy, “do you think I could </p><p>induce him to come into the vineyard?” </p><p>“Muley will go into anything that’s got </p><p>a door on it,” says I. “Also, he’ll take any- </p><p>thing what ain’t nailed down.” </p><p> “I fear me it will be a task,” he says, sad-</p><p>like, and then he sort of brightens up. </p><p>“Have you ever considered your soul?” </p><p> “I have no soul,” says I.</p><p> “Say not that you are a lost sheep,” he</p><p>chides me, and it makes me sore, and I </p><p>points off down the valley. </p><p> “We’re in cow-land now, old-timer, so</p><p>you lay off on that lost-sheep stuff. Sabe? </p><p>Down here they calls ’em plain strays.” </p><p> We plods down into the Sleeping Creek</p><p>country, and stops at Hank Padden’s place </p><p>for dinner. Old Testament and Hank are </p><p>old friends, but Hank don’t more than give </p><p>me a nod. I reckon he ain’t forgot what he </p><p>thought was Muley’s voice, and he blames </p><p>me, too. When we gets ready to leave </p><p>Hank acts like I had a contagious disease. </p><p> “Drop in any old time, Tilton,” says</p><p>Hank. “Glad to see you.” </p><p> “Me, too, Hank?” I asks, and he gives</p><p>me a hard look. </p><p> “You travels on your own responsibility,”</p><p>he replies. </p><p> “I wonder what Hank is sore at me for?”</p><p>I asks Old Testament, a little later, but he </p><p>shakes his head, and mumbles something </p><p>about the flocks on the seven hills and the </p><p>wrath to come. </p><p> “Did you tell him that I bought them</p><p>sheep?” I asks, and he nods. </p><p> “Yea. I did not Me, Henry Peck. I</p><p>know naught of Bowles.” </p><p> “I suppose you also told him that I was</p><p>going to stock this here range with sheep, </p><p>didn’t you?” </p><p> “I merely told him that I surmised</p><p>so.” </p><p> We rides almost to the Cross'J, when we</p><p>overtakes Abe Evans, the depot agent at </p><p>Paradise. </p><p> “Gosh! I’m glad you caught me,” pants</p><p>Abe, “I never was built to fit a saddle, and </p><p>this here nag ain’t no rocking-chair. Here’s </p><p>a telegram for Lemule Bowles, charges paid. </p><p>You sign for it, Hen, and let me go back </p><p>home.” </p><p> We pilgrims on to the ranch, but Muley</p><p>ain’t there. There’s a note on the table </p><p>which orates that he’ll be there at three </p><p>o’clock, and it’s addressed to Weinie Lopp, </p><p>of the Triangle. </p><p> “This here telegram ought to be opened,”</p><p>opines Old Testament, who is as nosey as </p><p>a pet coon. “A telegram always means </p><p>that something is going to happen, and it’s </p><p>better to be prepared.” </p><p> I tears the cover off and looks her over.</p><p>It says— </p><p> Will arrive your town this date meet me with a</p><p>vehicle. </p><p> And she’s signed Frederick &amp; Quincy.</p><p> I looks at my watch and decides on quick</p><p>action. </p><p> “You set down here and rest your feet,”</p><p>says I to Old Testament, “I’ll hitch up the </p><p>buckboard, and go to town. I just got</p><p>enough time to get there.” </p><p> That was some ride. Them broncs were</p><p>as wild as deer, and we went to Paradise </p><p>so fast that the dust didn’t settle for thirty </p><p>minutes after I ties up at the station. </p><p> The train is late, so I goes over to Mike</p><p>Pelly’s place, and washes the sheep-taste </p><p>out of my throat. It takes quite a lot of </p><p>liquid, and when I goes back to the station </p><p>I’m sheep-proof. </p><p> The train pulls in and I spots my man.</p><p>There’s quite a crowd at the station, but </p><p>I knowed him the minute he got off, and it </p><p>takes me about three steps to get where </p><p>he’s standing. Being sheep-proof, I’m also </p><p>polite, so I takes his valise away from him, </p><p>and starts for the rig. </p><p> “Come on, Blackstone,” says I, “your</p><p>carriage waits without.” </p><p> He starts with me, but he seems to com-</p><p>plain a heap, so I stops and asks him </p><p>whyfore the objections. </p><p> “Where the Sam Hill are you taking my</p><p>bag?” he asks, getting red in the face. </p><p>“Who told you to take that valise?” </p><p>Making Good for Muley </p><p>137 </p><p> “Mister,” says I, “don’t excite yourself</p><p>thataway. I’m doing all I can to make you </p><p>comfortable. Sabe? I advises you to come </p><p>along peaceable, and anything you may say </p><p>will be used against you.” </p><p> I always thought that lawyers tried to</p><p>settle things peaceably, but I don’t reckon </p><p>this one runs true to form, ’cause he hit me </p><p>so hard under the chin that he drove my </p><p>head right up to the top of my hat. That </p><p>hat always was too small, but after that </p><p>wallop I has to stuff the sweat-band with </p><p>paper so she’ll lit. </p><p> The train is pulling out when I wakes up,</p><p>and I sees that fat feller standing on the rear </p><p>platform. </p><p> “What was you aiming to do, Hen?” asks</p><p>Bill McFee, our sheriff, who is setting beside </p><p>me on the platform. </p><p> “That was the feller I was here to meet,</p><p>Bill,” says I. “He’s sure a sudden son-of-a- </p><p>gun for a lawyer.” </p><p> “He ain’t no lawyer, Henry,” says Bill.</p><p>“He’s the railroad paymaster, and he </p><p>thought you was trying to steal his </p><p>roll.” </p><p> “Wrong man,” says I. “Seen any</p><p>stranger get off the train?” </p><p> Bill shakes his head, so I pilgrims around</p><p>to where I tied my rig, and there sets Tele- </p><p>scope, Chuck and the old man. Them </p><p>three acts like they was tickled stiff, and </p><p>Telescope yelps at me— </p><p> “Got the telegram, did you, Henry?”</p><p> I don’t have nothing to say, and that</p><p>seems to make ’em more joyful. I don’t </p><p>keep silent from choice, but that feller darn </p><p>near unjointed my jaw and she hurts like </p><p>thunder when I opens my face. </p><p> “Muley still wearing crape?” asks Chuck,</p><p>as we ride out of town, and all three of ’em </p><p>busts out laughing. </p><p> “Danged mean trick,” opines the old</p><p>man. “You remember Jimmy Frederick,</p><p>don’t you, Hen? He was out here a few </p><p>years ago. He knows Muley well. We </p><p>were up in his office and Telescope and </p><p>Chuck got him to write that letter.” </p><p> “How many sheep has Muley bought on</p><p>his nerve?” asks Chuck. </p><p> “Come on through, Hen. Did he buy</p><p>out Zeb’s herd? I hope he ain’t got mutton </p><p>for our supper.” And then Telescope sings </p><p>sort of plaintive like: </p><p>“I love a little chicken and I love a little fish. </p><p>When somebody says ‘ham and eggs,’ I pass along </p><p> my dish.</p><p>When I get good and hungry I could eat a roarin’ </p><p> bull,</p><p>But when they passes mutton meat my stummick’s </p><p> full.”</p><p> And then Chuck joins in the chorus:</p><p>“I’m a tough old rooster, and I’ve eaten snakes, </p><p>I’ve spread giant powder on my buckwheat cakes, </p><p>I’ve drank rawliide stew ’till I was out of breath, </p><p>But when they serves up mutton meat I starves </p><p> to death.”</p><p> “You’re a fine bunch of friends!” I snaps,</p><p>taking a chance that my jaw is still on its </p><p>hinges. “She was his favorite relative, </p><p>and since that letter he ain’t done nothing </p><p>but mope. You’re a danged bunch of </p><p>ghoul comedians. Muley’s due to kill </p><p>somebody when he finds out about it. </p><p>What was the main idea?” </p><p> “Well,” laughs Telescope, “we made him</p><p>rich for a while, didn’t we? Zeb orates </p><p>that he wants Susie to marry money, so </p><p>we gave it to him in a lump. We puts in </p><p>that marriage clause just to see if Muley </p><p>loved her enough to lose the money. Sabe? </p><p>We knowed danged well that he couldn’t </p><p>buy no sheep. What did the parrot have </p><p>to say, Hen?” </p><p> “Told Hank Padden he could use sheep</p><p>dip.” </p><p> “Haw, haw, haw!” whoops Chuck. “Did</p><p>he honest say that? I sat up all one night </p><p>and day trying to teach that parrot some</p><p>sheep-talk, but all it ever did was to bite </p><p>me. Telescope swiped that cat at the </p><p>depot in Milwaukee.” </p><p> /JUST before we reaches the ranch</p><p>| three people rides in ahead of us </p><p>and waits for us to come up. It’s </p><p>Hank Padden. Johnny Myers and “Scenery” </p><p>Sims. They all got rifles. </p><p> We exchanges greetings, but they don’t</p><p>seem glad to see nobody but me. </p><p> “We don’t aim to be nosey, Mr. Peck,”</p><p>says Hank, “but we’d admire to hear a little </p><p>more about them sheep.” </p><p> “What sheep?” I asks, surprised-like.</p><p>“Old Testament told me,” says Hank. </p><p>“He spoke about you going to start a herd </p><p>here and-” </p><p> “I thanks you for the compliment,” says</p><p>I. “It seems nice to be mistaken for a </p><p>capitalist, Hank, but what I wants to know </p><p>is this: how long since have you been </p><p>taking the word of a shepherd? Do I need </p><p>to deny it?” </p><p> “Old Testament must have lied, Hank,”</p><p>138 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>states the old man. “He must have been </p><p>crazy to state such a thing. Somebody’s </p><p>crazy anyway.” </p><p> “That’s what I said,” squeaks Scenery.</p><p>“Hen Peck couldn’t buy a pair of wool </p><p>socks.” </p><p> They all nods sort of agreeable-like, and</p><p>he drives on. </p><p> “After a while, when there ain’t nobody</p><p>around to interrupt us, I’m going to ask </p><p>you a few questions, Henry,” states Chuck, </p><p>solemn-like. </p><p> “You better bring a witness,” says I.</p><p>“All I wants is an uninterested third party </p><p>present so I can prove I shot in self- </p><p>defense.” </p><p> We pulls up to the ranch. The front</p><p>door is open and two rigs are tied out in </p><p>front. We pilgrims up to the door, and are </p><p>greeted with some sight. </p><p> There’s Old Testament standing in the</p><p>middle of the room, with his eyes rolled </p><p>toward the rafters, while in front of him </p><p>stands Susie Abernathy and Muley Bowles. </p><p>Muley’s vest is stretched to the bursting </p><p>point, and you could light a match on </p><p>Susie’s freckles. </p><p> To one side stands Zeb Abernathy, and</p><p>on the other stands Weinie Lopp, all </p><p>dressed up in a celluloid collar, and no place </p><p>to put his hands. </p><p> We hears Old Testament finish up his</p><p>prayer, and as Muley folds Susie to his </p><p>bosom we troops inside. Muley sees us </p><p>over Susie’s shoulder, and breaks the clinch. </p><p>Zeb grins out through his whiskers and </p><p>Weinie Lopp turns up the collar of his coat. </p><p> Everything is still for a few seconds, and</p><p>then Old Testament smiles at me over his </p><p>specs: </p><p> “My son,” says he, “it’s fortunate that</p><p>I came with you. I had considered taking </p><p>a trip over into the Bitter Roots, and Mister </p><p>Lopp would have missed me.” </p><p> “Exactly,” says I, having the under-</p><p>standing of a fish. “All very true. Was </p><p>Weinie on your trail?” </p><p> “Uh-huh,” gurgles Weinie,“I—I was after</p><p>a preacher for Muley.” </p><p> “They—they just got married,” chuckles</p><p>Zeb. “Just now.” </p><p> “Well,” says Chuck, foolish-like, “who</p><p>gets the first kiss from the bride—after you, </p><p>Muley?” </p><p> “Muley, you’re a hero!” gasps Telescope.</p><p>“Any man is a hero who will sacrifice a </p><p>hundred thousand dollars at the throne of </p><p>love. Everybody take off your hats to </p><p>Muley Bowles.” </p><p> Everybody’s got their hats off so we don’t</p><p>respond. </p><p> “What did you mean by that, Tele-</p><p>scope?” gasps Zeb. “Do—do you mean </p><p>that he—he’ll lose all that money ’cause he </p><p>married Susie?” </p><p> “You said it, Zeb,” grins Telescope.”</p><p>Ain’t you proud of him? What a nephew- </p><p>in-law!” and then he turns to Muley: </p><p>“Muley, old-timer, I didn’t think you had </p><p>it in you, but you never can tell which way </p><p>a dill pickle will squirt. How does it seem </p><p>to lose a hundred thousand dollars?” </p><p>“Well,” grins Muley, putting one arm </p><p>around the shrinking bride. “I ain’t lying </p><p>to you when I says I don’t know how it </p><p>feels. You see, Telescope, the name of </p><p>Allender don’t cover no branch of my </p><p>family-tree, and I never had any Aunt </p><p>Agnes.” </p><p> There’s a painful silence for a minute, and</p><p>then comes a flutter of feathers, and in </p><p>waddles Alfred. He ain’t got no tail- </p><p>feathers left, and the rest of his carcass is </p><p>pretty well plucked. He looks us over, </p><p>wild-eyed, ruffles up his remaining foliage, </p><p>croaks: </p><p> “Har, har, har! Who’s crazy?”</p><p> Zeb looks wide-eyed at the bird for a</p><p>moment, and then sneaks past it and out </p><p>on the steps:	*</p><p> “I’m going away,” says he, in a low,</p><p>hoarse voice. “Going away before that </p><p>bird answers its own questions.” </p><p> “Tally three more,” states Telescope,</p><p>and him and Chuck and the old man sneaks </p><p>out. </p><p> “Make it five,” says I, and me and</p><p>Weinie goes out, too. </p><p>Captain Jinx </p><p>[iV Kingsbury Scott </p><p>Author of "Young Johnny Eisledt." </p><p> HE call for bottoms on salt water</p><p>threatened to sweep the lakes </p><p>clear of craft, with tons of coal </p><p>to be shipped to the upper lakes </p><p>and bushels of wheat to be carried from </p><p>Lake Superior. Whole fleets of new canal- </p><p>size steel ships were being fitted for salt- </p><p>water service, and wooden craft were being </p><p>rushed on the stocks to follow them. </p><p> Everybody had a job or the prospect of</p><p>one and hundreds of licensed officers were </p><p>taking advantage of the let-down of the bars </p><p>in the inspection sendee to post up for the </p><p>salt-water examinations. Masters came </p><p>in plenty to brush up on navigation, and </p><p>engineers added condensing engine knowl- </p><p>edge to their fresh-water experience, all </p><p>tempted by the bonus of the merchant ma- </p><p>rine, which made them forget the subma- </p><p>rines in their dreams of a luxurious time </p><p>ashore when a few voyages across the sea </p><p>had been finished. </p><p> Every licensed sailor man in Lakeport</p><p>seemed fired by the same idea—all except </p><p>Captain Johnny Rice. </p><p> The fact is, Johnny Rice had not sailed a</p><p>boat for five years, for the very simple </p><p>reason that he had not been offered one to </p><p>sail. Five years before, the superintendent </p><p>of the Superior Transit Company had told </p><p>him that the company had nothing for him, </p><p>but advised him to wait until something </p><p>turned up in the line. So for five years </p><p>Johnny Rice had waited. </p><p> He had seen the new boats come up from</p><p>the Ecorse and the Wyandotte yards, with </p><p>youngsters who had wheeled for him, on </p><p>their bridges, but still he waited for some- </p><p>thing to turn up. Each Spring he made his </p><p>application for a berth to the superintend- </p><p>ent, until it had become merely a matter </p><p>of form to him as well as to the superin- </p><p>tendent. </p><p> In the meantime Johnny Rice had to</p><p>work at something to keep his board paid at </p><p>Mother Reagan’s, so he took a job as floor </p><p>boss in the Hudson Line’s warehouses,</p><p>where the hours were long and he earned </p><p>sixty a month. </p><p> Johnny knew the reason as well as any</p><p>sailor along the water-front and it cut into </p><p>his sensitive nature to hear them discussing </p><p>him as “Captain Jinx.” He could not for- </p><p>get that he was the man who had rammed </p><p>the bow out of the Clarion against the </p><p>Broadway Bridge in Milwaukee. Neither </p><p>could he escape the recollection that he was </p><p>the man who had torn the bottom out of the </p><p>Hesperia on the north crib at Lakeport one </p><p>foggy morning. </p><p> Worst of all, he knew he was marked</p><p>from one end of the lakes to the other as the </p><p>man who had rammed the passenger </p><p>steamer Corunna in St. Mary’s River with </p><p>the Superior Line’s big freighter, Baltic, and </p><p>sent both ships to the bottom with too many </p><p>of their people with them. </p><p> The Government inspectors had not</p><p>exactly blamed him entirely for the acci- </p><p>dent. They had merely suspended his </p><p>139 </p><p>140 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>license for the remainder of that season. </p><p>But the Superior Line, with damage suits to </p><p>pay, had gone a bit farther. They had ap- </p><p>peared to have suspended him indefinitely, </p><p>retaining him in their service from year to </p><p>year—without pay. </p><p> Furthermore, he had been black-listed</p><p>by every insurance company and every </p><p>other line on the lakes. In fact, bad luck </p><p>had seemed to follow him from the very </p><p>day he walked out of the inspector’s office at </p><p>Lakeport with his master’s license. Though </p><p>he felt that he had earned his title, Captain </p><p>Jinx, he resented it none-the-less. </p><p> “It’s the bad luck that’s followin’ me,” he</p><p>comforted himself. “And it’s been bad </p><p>luck after me since the day I went aboard a </p><p>ship of my own. I’d get away from it if </p><p>they’d give me a chance.” </p><p> The hours were long, the pay was small</p><p>and the work in the warehouse grated on </p><p>the sensitive nerves of Captain Johnny Rice </p><p>in the five years which followed the Corunna </p><p>affair, but there seemed no ray of light </p><p>shining ahead of him. </p><p> Then the war came on. The sound of the</p><p>boiler-makers’ hammers beat the silence at </p><p>deserted wharves and the odor of fresh </p><p>paint filled the air. Smoke curled from the </p><p>stacks of the foul-bottomed ships, which had </p><p>not turned a wheel for years. The freights </p><p>were up and going higher and there were </p><p>not bottoms enough to carry the cargoes. </p><p>Everything which could pass the inspection </p><p>was going liack into commission. </p><p>JOHNNY RICE was in the midst of </p><p>a cloud of flour dust in the ware- </p><p>house one morning when he saw </p><p>Felton, the superintendent of the Superior </p><p>Line, dodging between the long line of rum- </p><p>bling trucks, trying to avoid being run down </p><p>by the “hunky” handlers. Something told </p><p>Johnny that the superintendent wanted </p><p>him and he started forward through the </p><p>dust. </p><p> “I’m looking for you, Johnny,” an-</p><p>nounced the superintendent. “Something’s </p><p>turned up at last. Do you want a boat to </p><p>sail?”</p><p> “That I do, sir,” promptly responded the</p><p>dusty man. “What’s it to be?” </p><p> “The Swain," answered Felton. “We’re</p><p>fitting her out and I’ve got to have her </p><p>right away. I want a good man to sail </p><p>her.” </p><p> He did not tell Johnny Rice that he had</p><p>been trying to find a man for two days, to </p><p>sail the Philip Swain, and it would have </p><p>made little difference if he had. Captain </p><p>Jinx had enough of the warehouse and he </p><p>would have taken command of one of the </p><p>Columbus caravels had it been offered to </p><p>him. </p><p> “The hoodoo, eh?” he remarked, with a</p><p>grin. “With me aboard, the two of us, </p><p>between us, ought to bust the jinx.” </p><p> “She’s been abused, that’s all,” said Fel-</p><p>ton, fearing that even Johnny Rice might </p><p>refuse the berth. “There’s nothing wrong </p><p>with her and we’ll pay you the steel boat </p><p>scale. I want to get her out the first of the </p><p>week, Johnny, when can you come aboard?” </p><p> “Tomorrow morning,” replied Johnny</p><p>Rice, “or tonight, if you like.” </p><p> “The sooner the better, as far as we are</p><p>concerned. Your pay starts today, then,” </p><p>declared Felton. “You’ll have to pick up </p><p>your own crew.” </p><p> That very night Captain Johnny Rice of</p><p>the steamer Philip Swain began picking up </p><p>his crew. He went first into Mother Rea- </p><p>gan’s barroom at an hour when he knew </p><p>he’d find Tom Carter and Willie Larson </p><p>together and mellow in their cups. In fact </p><p>he chose the hour that he might find them </p><p>not too sober and yet not too drunk. He </p><p>needed a couple of mates and he knew they </p><p>would fill the bill once they were safely </p><p>aboard ship and away from Mother Rea- </p><p>gan’s “forty rod.” </p><p> It required all of the diplomacy at his</p><p>command, which he finally cinched at the </p><p>proper time, with an appeal to their pa- </p><p>triotism to do their part in the country’s </p><p>work, to secure their promise. But as it </p><p>happened they were just ripe for an appeal </p><p>to do their bit for their Uncle Sam in the</p><p>merchant marine of the Great Lakes. </p><p> They insisted strongly at first that he</p><p>bring the old shoe up to Mother Reagan’s </p><p>they they might have a good look over her, </p><p>but once they agreed to be with him, Cap- </p><p>tain Johnny knew the deal was closed. </p><p>Tom Carter and Willie Larson never broke </p><p>their word with him. </p><p> He had a harder task with old Harvey</p><p>Goulder, who had quit drinking too late to </p><p>save him from the fate of pulling the </p><p>throttle on a fish tug. But Johnny Rice </p><p>knew and every other marine man knew </p><p>that old Harvey Goulder, with his big ton- </p><p>nage papers, was a wizard of a chief en- </p><p>gineer. He knew also that old Harvey was </p><p>Captain Jinx </p><p>141 </p><p>not getting on very well with the salary his </p><p>fish-tug job paid, and that the scale on a </p><p>steel boat was likely to look pretty good to </p><p>the old Scotsman and to the old lady in the </p><p>house which was falling to pieces around </p><p>them. </p><p> “What boat is it?” asked old Harvey,</p><p>suspiciously sitting on the edge of his chair </p><p>in the sitting-room with cracked paper on </p><p>the walls. </p><p> “The Philip Swain,” admitted Johnny</p><p>Rice, with a gulp in his throat. </p><p> “That old corpse!” exclaimed the old</p><p>man. “So they’ve dug her up out o’ the </p><p>grave, too, eh? She’s not turned a wheel </p><p>for years.” </p><p> “But she’s a big ship and well built,</p><p>Harvey,” ventured the skipper. “She’s </p><p>never been given half a show.” </p><p> “With a machine that was a wreck when</p><p>it was built,” commented Goulder. “She </p><p>went through herself twice the first season </p><p>out. </p><p> “I made a trip to Buffalo in her once and</p><p>I watched that old engine dance around the </p><p>engine-room the whole trip. Then I went </p><p>ashore in Buffalo and got drunk and I </p><p>wasn’t around when she was ready to leave. </p><p>I thought that drunk had saved my life, and </p><p>you could have knocked me over when I </p><p>heard she got back to Chicago without the </p><p>machine walkin’ out of the gangway.” </p><p> Old Harvey Goulder smoked his pipe vig-</p><p>orously and stared at the cracked wall-paper. </p><p>It would have been hard to follow his </p><p>thoughts, perhaps, but at the end of his </p><p>dream he turned his fiery old eyes on Johnny </p><p>Rice and glared at him from under his white- </p><p>fringed brows. </p><p> “You and me are in about the same fix,”</p><p>he remarked, slowly. “We aint been in the </p><p>swim much lately, have we, Johnny? I </p><p>don’t see why we shouldn’t take a chance on </p><p>our old hides and get some of the surplus </p><p>the Superior Line’s goin’ to pull out o’ the </p><p>high freights. If the old wagon goes under </p><p>with us, she goes, that’s all and we might’s</p><p>well end up that way as starve to death here </p><p>ashore. You’ve got nobody, and the old </p><p>woman’d be better off without me.” </p><p>WITH young Hughie McGregor, </p><p>his nephew, who had just passed his </p><p>examination for his second’s papers, </p><p>as his assistant, Harvey Goulder was </p><p>pounding and pulling at the Swain’s run- </p><p>ning-gear early the next morning. Little by </p><p>little the crew of the steamer was pieced </p><p>together. Firemen from Donovan’s and </p><p>Mother Reagan’s with their duffle on their </p><p>backs, and watchmen and oilers and deck- </p><p>hands, the flotsam of the human sea, came </p><p>aboard, one by one. They were kicked at </p><p>and sworn at by big Tom Carter, sick of his </p><p>mate’s job and keeping full of whisky to for- </p><p>get his disgrace, and fed on the grub thrown </p><p>at them by a cook who was hiding away </p><p>from the Army. </p><p> “I’ve a fine crew here,” mused Johnny</p><p>Rice, when he stood on the bridge at last, </p><p>ready to pull the stand-by whistle. </p><p>“They’re a fine bunch to run this old ark </p><p>light to the head of Lake Superior this time </p><p>of the year.” </p><p> “But, Lord knows I’m runnin’ no bigger</p><p>chance with them than they are with me,” </p><p>he sighed. </p><p> Swinging out from the dock with her big</p><p>rusty hull high in the water, the ungainly </p><p>ship caught the current of the stream just </p><p>at the wrong moment and swirling around </p><p>until her stern line snapped, she crashed into </p><p>the side of the old schooner, Sunset, across </p><p>the channel. As she slowly backed away </p><p>the rusty steel bow slipped out of a jagged </p><p>hole in the wooden side of the sailing craft. </p><p>Gradually the Sunset began to settle lower </p><p>and lower like an animal which had re- </p><p>ceived its death blow, until her deck was </p><p>awash. </p><p> “That’s the first one,” exclaimed Johnny.</p><p>“If that’s the beginning, we’re goin’ to have </p><p>a fine time of it before we get to Lake </p><p>Superior.” </p><p> Down in the engine-room Harvey felt the</p><p>shock as he jumped to respond to the back- </p><p>ing signal. </p><p> “Lord bless us!” he cried. “Captain</p><p>Jinx is beginnin’ early. The poor devil! </p><p>No man’s ever been chased as hard by a </p><p>hoodoo as him.” </p><p> When at last the Swain steamed out of</p><p>the harbor that early Fall morning, the </p><p>superintendent breathed a sigh of relief. </p><p> “Well, he’s away at last,” he remarked</p><p>grimly to the old port captain, who stood </p><p>beside him. “I’m glad he didn’t leave his </p><p>mark on anything but the old Sunset. </p><p>Funny, aint it, the luck he has?” </p><p> “The Swain always was a bad one to</p><p>handle,” responded the port captain. “And </p><p>with nothing in her she’s worse than a big </p><p>basket in the wind. I’m not envying him </p><p>his run light to Lake Superior. With the </p><p>142 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>ore in her coming down, she will handle bet- </p><p>ter if she don’t swamp.” </p><p> Up Lake Michigan to the Straits of Mack-</p><p>inac steamed the Swain with the seas from </p><p>the westward rolling her slimy old bottom </p><p>up to the sun. Old Harvey Goulder down </p><p>below, watched the big engine dance at a </p><p>lively pace, and sweated the beer and booze </p><p>out of his firemen keeping steam to give her </p><p>speed. With all of her shortcomings it </p><p>must be said that the Swain had the legs. </p><p>With all of its clanging and clattering and </p><p>its threats to fall apart, her engine could </p><p>drive her at a good fifteen-mile clip pro- </p><p>viding the boilers could be coaxed into hold- </p><p>ing the steam. </p><p> Through the straits she sped into St.</p><p>Mary’s River with her luck still holding </p><p>good. But Captain Johnny Rice faced sus- </p><p>pension every minute for exceeding the </p><p>speed permitted in the channel by Uncle </p><p>Sam. Flashing along, with her bilge water </p><p>shooting far out from her shanky side, she </p><p>swung the bends in the river like the most </p><p>delicate motor-car, answering her helm with </p><p>a fidelity that was almost uncanny. </p><p> “She scares me, sor!” commented the</p><p>wheelsman up through the swearing-box </p><p>to the skipper. “She’s that angelic that I </p><p>fear she’s figurin’ on something devilish </p><p>later on. Sure, I’ve wheeled her before, </p><p>sor, and I know that there were times when </p><p>I’d swore on me oath that there was nothing </p><p>on the other end of these wheel chains.” </p><p>“Make the best of her while she’s be- </p><p>havin’, Murphy,” cautioned the skipper. </p><p>“Remember, we’re gettin’ to the Soo. </p><p>Look out for the locks!” </p><p> “I’m rememberin’, sor, and I’m remem-</p><p>berin’ that if there is anything within a </p><p>mile of her, she’ll hit it, too.” </p><p> Going through the locks the Swain did</p><p>nothing more serious than scrape the con- </p><p>crete walls so viciously that the officers </p><p>ashore swore vigorously at {he skipper and </p><p>threatened to report him for carelessness. </p><p>In the wheelhouse, Murphy ground his </p><p>teeth and fairly hung to the wheel. </p><p> “The dirty devil!” he growled. “She’s</p><p>human and downright mean, that’s what </p><p>she is!” </p><p> Below in the engine-room Harvey Goul-</p><p>der stood a watch with his young nephew, </p><p>standing with his hand on the throttle and </p><p>his pipe clenched between his teeth. </p><p> “I’ll not be easy until we get her out into</p><p>open water again, boy,” was his com- </p><p>ment. “She needs room and speed to be </p><p>safe.” </p><p> A lucky star seemed to be hovering over</p><p>the old Philip Swain, as she locked through </p><p>the canal, and Johnny Rice rang up the </p><p>engine-room as soon as he was clear, with </p><p>the welcome signal to Goulder to give her all </p><p>she had once more. Out past the White </p><p>Fish Point light, she foamed with a howling </p><p>nor’easter blowing behind her. The gale </p><p>increased and with it the Swain added to </p><p>her speed, with the big seas rolling up and </p><p>hissing under her lifting stern. </p><p> It was blowing great guns outside of the</p><p>point and the Swain riding high in the </p><p>water, pitched heavily into the great hollows </p><p>which raced up behind her and overtook her. </p><p>Clouds of black smoke poured from her </p><p>funnel and streamed out far ahead of her, </p><p>spreading like a fan over the huge greenish </p><p>combers. Wrapped in his ulster, Captain </p><p>Johnny Rice clung to the bridge rail. </p><p> “Good thing she’s runnin’ before it,” he</p><p>told himself. “Standin’ up out of water </p><p>like this, the old tub couldn’t do much with </p><p>a head sea.” </p><p>DAY and night the gale kept up as </p><p>the Swain plugged along at her </p><p>tremendous clip. The skipper with </p><p>but a wink of sleep now and then in his </p><p>room in the Texas, had remained almost </p><p>continually on the bridge. In the engine- </p><p>room Harvey Goulder dozed by bits in his </p><p>armchair, to start up each time the seas </p><p>smashed hard under the stern with a metal- </p><p>lic crash. As the Swain neared Keweenaw </p><p>Point, jutting out for miles into Lake </p><p>Superior, with its copper-laden rocks, the </p><p>skipper and his chief met at supper. </p><p> “Are you goin’ through the canal?” asked</p><p>Harvey Goulder. “There’s probably a big </p><p>sea off the point, with this wind.”</p><p> “Sea or no sea,” asserted Johnny Rice.</p><p>“I’m going to keep outside if she ships the </p><p>seas through the smoke stack. There’s </p><p>nothing coming down the lake against this </p><p>weather and there’s no danger of fetching up </p><p>against- anything when she’s got the whole </p><p>lake to herself.” </p><p> “I’m glad to hear it,” declared Goulder.</p><p>“It’s room and speed she needs to make her </p><p>behave. I’d rather take a chance with her </p><p>going full speed outside, if she does bob like </p><p>a cork, than to be hittin’ each side o’ the </p><p>canal goin’ through. There’s probably a </p><p>hundred boats in Mud Lake and she’d </p><p>Captain Jinx </p><p>143 </p><p>have a fine time buntin’ into ’em all and </p><p>smashin’ their plates for ’em.” </p><p> A great idea seemed to form in Johnny</p><p>Rice’s mind and he smiled for the first time </p><p>since he had left the Soo. </p><p> “Right you are, Harvey!” he cried.</p><p>“Right you are, by Gad!” </p><p> When the morning came with a streaky</p><p>light in the sky the Swain was doing some </p><p>great performance off the point. As the </p><p>light broadened Captain Rice could see the </p><p>rocky headland standing out against the </p><p>milky spray, beating at its base. Fully </p><p>three miles ahead and off his port bow, </p><p>Captain Johnny Rice was astounded to see </p><p>a big steamer wallowing in the seas. With- </p><p>out comment, he focused his glasses upon </p><p>her. </p><p> She was low in the water, evidently</p><p>loaded with ore, and the seas were foaming </p><p>over her decks, amidships. As the skipper </p><p>of the Swain studied her through the </p><p>glasses, he saw four jets of steam rise from </p><p>her siren, and although the sound of the </p><p>whistle was lost in the storm, he knew that </p><p>she was calling for assistance. </p><p> “She’s in trouble!” he shouted to Carter,</p><p>the mate who was standing the watch on </p><p>the bridge with him. “And she’s in a bad </p><p>way there, driftin’ up against that point. </p><p>See what you make out of it, Carter.” </p><p> The mate took the glasses and studied the</p><p>stranger carefully. </p><p> “It’s one of the Bessemer ore fellows.</p><p>Looks like she had no headway at all, sir,” </p><p>he announced. </p><p> “We’re not any too well off ourselves,”</p><p>said the skipper, “but if we could get near </p><p>enough to do those poor devils any good, I’d </p><p>try it. I hate to stand by and see them go </p><p>under.” </p><p> “You’re the skipper, sir,” declared Carter.</p><p>“I’m with you in whatever you do. Thisold </p><p>shoe’s hard to handle and we stand a chance </p><p>o’ losin’ her.” </p><p> “It wouldn’t be much loss to the com-</p><p>pany,” said the skipper. “But I don’t want </p><p>to dump this gang into Lake Superior, </p><p>without givin’ ’em a chance. We’ve got to </p><p>do something quick if we do it at all. We’ll </p><p>give it a try, anyway, and if the old tin box </p><p>piles up on the rocks, it’ll have to stand </p><p>against my soul.” </p><p> Plunging along like a race-horse with the</p><p>foam flecking her sides, the Swain bore </p><p>down upon the distressed steamer, keeping </p><p>to the windward of her to avoid the nar- </p><p>rowing space between the disabled craft and </p><p>the rocks. As the Swain approached, the </p><p>name Thomas Benton, Buffalo, in round- </p><p>ed gold letters stood out visibly on the </p><p>stern. </p><p> Within thirty feet of the Benton's stern</p><p>Johnny Rice rang to Goulder to check </p><p>down. The Swain was just coming abreast </p><p>of the helpless craft when she felt the slack- </p><p>ening of speed and almost instantly she </p><p>began to perform. Her helm spun help- </p><p>lessly and the rolling combers sent her </p><p>swirling down upon the Benton. With a </p><p>crash and a shudder which caused the </p><p>skipper and the mate to cling fast to the </p><p>bridge rail the two boats came together </p><p>broadside in the roaring sea. </p><p> Down in the engine-room old Harvey</p><p>Goulder picked himself up from the floor </p><p>and rubbed a sore elbow. </p><p> “What the blazes has Captain Jinx hit</p><p>now, out here in the middle of Lake Supe- </p><p>rior!” he shouted, angrily. </p><p> Young McGregor bounded up the safety</p><p>ladder to the main deck as Goulder scram- </p><p>bled back to the throttle. Within a few mo- </p><p>ments the second engineer came rushing </p><p>back with his eyes popping. </p><p> “We’re layin’ up ’longside a big fellow</p><p>that’s in a bad way,” he announced. “And </p><p>they’re heavin’ a line aboard of her. I </p><p>heard her skipper yell to Johnny that she’d </p><p>broken her shaft and was driftin’ on the </p><p>rocks.” </p><p> With his announcement came the clang</p><p>of the gong. The telegraph indicator spun </p><p>around to the signal, “Full speed ahead!” </p><p>Harvey gave her all she had and the old</p><p>Swain creaked and strained under the drag </p><p>of the laden craft she had taken in tow. </p><p>But the straining was short lived. Sud- </p><p>denly the Swain seemed to leave the water </p><p>in a headlong dash forward and speed ahead </p><p>like a hound freed from a leash. </p><p> “There’s one rotten line gone,” com-</p><p>mented Goulder. “If we have the usual </p><p>luck it’ll be in our wheel in a minute.” </p><p> From the bridge Captain Johnny Rice</p><p>saw the line let go and he groaned with </p><p>disappointment. </p><p> “Might have known it wouldn’t go right,”</p><p>he growled between clenched teeth. </p><p>“Tilings never did for me and they never </p><p>will, I guess. Rotten old line like every- </p><p>thing else on board this outfit! We’ll have </p><p>to do it all over again.” </p><p> “Carter!” he called out. “Get out every</p><p>144 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>heavin’ line aboard the ship and splice ’em </p><p>all together somehow! Maybe they’ve got </p><p>something on the Benton that’ll hold, if we </p><p>can get a heavin’ line aboard.” </p><p> With the wallowing Benton far astern and</p><p>still drifting slowly inshore toward the </p><p>rocks, the Philip Swain began swinging </p><p>around in a wide arc to avoid wracking as </p><p>much as possible. But as she fell into the </p><p>trough of the mountaineous seas, the rush- </p><p>ing greenish combers threatened to roll her </p><p>; clear over. </p><p>, Everything loose swept across her decks </p><p>with a roar as she lurched down and then </p><p>went racing back as she rolled the other way. </p><p>The seas struck her steel sides and the spray </p><p>broke completely over her in white clouds, </p><p>leaving her slimy bottom visible clear to the </p><p>keel. At last in a perfect cataract of foam </p><p>she swung her nose into the seas and pitched </p><p>violently, fore and aft. </p><p>FOR more than an hour she bat- </p><p>tled on against the wind and the </p><p>seas until every window in her pilot- </p><p>house was shattered clean from its sash, and </p><p>Mike Murphy, who was at the helm, stood </p><p>drenched and shivering at the wheel, his </p><p>face and hands bleeding from a dozen </p><p>cuts. </p><p> But the Benton was astern again on the</p><p>starboard side when the Swain began to </p><p>repeat her contortions in the trough of the </p><p>sea, as Murphy put her about again. And </p><p>with the seas behind her once more, every </p><p>one on board the Swain breathed a little </p><p>sigh of relief, along with a prayer of thanks- </p><p>giving, perhaps. At any rate the Swain </p><p>picked up her headway rapidly and bore </p><p>down again upon the disabled Benton. </p><p> For once things seemed about to turn out</p><p>as Captain Johnny Rice figured they </p><p>should. Fortunately the progress of the </p><p>ore-laden Benton toward the rocky shore </p><p>line had been slow. The seas had swept </p><p>over her continually but her heavy, bulky </p><p>hull, low in the water, resisted the drive </p><p>like a water-soaked log. </p><p> As she drifted slowly into shallower water</p><p>off the point, she let go her anchors as a last</p><p>hope and the rocky bottom furnished a </p><p>catch for them. The chains strained and </p><p>tugged and clanged with the roll of the </p><p>boat, but they held, though the sweeping </p><p>seas threatened constantly to break the grip </p><p>of the anchors on the bottom. </p><p> With an audacity which astounded him-</p><p>self, Johnny Rice drove the Swain full speed </p><p>into the channel between the Benton and </p><p>the rocks. So close was the speeding ship </p><p>to the outlying rocks of the point that the </p><p>roar of the breakers sounded in the skipper’s </p><p>ears above the howl of the wind. But the </p><p>Swain drove forward as true as a die to her </p><p>helm. </p><p> A grim smile of satisfaction spread over</p><p>Johnny Rice’s face. He had solved the </p><p>secret of mastery of the hoodoo ship, and his </p><p>great idea had worked out successfully. </p><p>Under strong headway the Swain would </p><p>handle with the accuracy of a racing yacht. </p><p>Without it she was as helpless as a craft </p><p>without a rudder. </p><p> Just at the right time Carter, stationed on</p><p>the after cabin, sent the thin black heaving </p><p>line twisting through space and as it landed </p><p>with a thud on the wet deck of the Benton, </p><p>a desperate sailor from that ship sprawled </p><p>over it, emerging from a sea which buried </p><p>him at the same time, with the line clasped </p><p>firmly in his hands. Like a madman he </p><p>rushed forward with it and with lightning </p><p>fingers he made it fast in the bight of the </p><p>stout cable which was waiting there. The </p><p>skipper of the Benton appeared to have read </p><p>the mind of Captain John Rice. </p><p> Several hundred feet of heaving line,</p><p>spliced together, had spun out from the </p><p>Swain as she passed the Benton at express </p><p>speed. Then she slackened up to save the </p><p>strain which would come when the heavy </p><p>cable came dripping and twisting through </p><p>the sea like a long, thin snake. And when </p><p>it was aboard at last and made fast around </p><p>the drum of the big windlass in the Swain’s </p><p>stern, the big siren roared out a triumphant </p><p>signal. The cable straightened out under </p><p>the strain, and the screw of the Swain </p><p>sent the water rumbling away from her </p><p>stern. </p><p> On board the Benton, the anchor hoists</p><p>rattled and deck engines coughed rapidly.</p><p>Quickly the great folding anchors which had </p><p>saved her were torn from their grip on the </p><p>rocks below, and the deep-laden ship began </p><p>to slip forward, slowly and uncertainly at </p><p>first and then more steadily with increasing </p><p>speed. Her prow swung outward as the </p><p>Swain pulled her away from the rocks and </p><p>destruction. As the Benton plunged for- </p><p>ward under the steady pull, a deep blast from </p><p>her whistle informed the Swain of her safety </p><p>in a language stronger than the victorious </p><p>shouts of men. </p><p>The Raven Mocker </p><p>145 </p><p>IT WAS a long dreary drag to Du- </p><p>luth, but the gale had blown itself </p><p>out when the Swain pulled into the </p><p>outer harbor with the Benton plowing at the </p><p>end of a long tow line behind her. A tug </p><p>came rolling out to relieve her of her burden </p><p>and the Swain went on alone up the chan- </p><p>nel, bumping a dock, here and there, to </p><p>maintain her reputation. </p><p> Captain Johnny Rice stumbled ashore as</p><p>soon as she landed and remained long </p><p>enough to wire a report of the affair to </p><p>Felton. Then he went back aboard and </p><p>rolled into his bunk, without removing his </p><p>clothes. When he awakened twenty hours </p><p>later, the lake country from Buffalo to Port </p><p>Arthur, was ablaze with the press yarns of </p><p>his performance, and Carter was nearly </p><p>frantic in his effort to keep the marine re- </p><p>porters from breaking in upon the skipper’s </p><p>slumbers. </p><p> Felton’s telegram was the first thing to</p><p>catch Captain Johnny Rice’s eye as he </p><p>rolled out of his berth and he tore open the </p><p>yellow envelope with a quick yank to see if </p><p>lie had been relieved of his command for </p><p>his foolishness. However, a sleepy smile </p><p>forced itself into his countenance as he </p><p>read: </p><p> Great! You’ve busted the jinx. Come home</p><p> by rail.</p><p> Have something here for you.</p><p>Author of "The Skidi Feed the Evening Star,” “A New Keeper of the Wampum,” etc. </p><p>OWN the Great War Trail that </p><p>threaded all the country east </p><p>of the Mississippi together in </p><p>peace and war sped Yanegwa, </p><p>“Big Bear,” returning from the home of </p><p>the Iroquois to the Upper Towns of the </p><p>Cherokee Nation on the Tennessee. The </p><p>Upper Towns had expected an embassy </p><p>of old and experienced warriors to under- </p><p>take the mission in this Autumn of 1738. </p><p>'But in the great council held at Echota, the </p><p>capital and peace town, the priests spent </p><p>a day in studying the great talismanic </p><p>crystal and reported it was always the </p><p>figure of the young warrior that floated to</p><p>the top. So he “went to the water” to </p><p>10 </p><p>purify himself by bathing. For ten days </p><p>he drank the peace medicine and then got </p><p>eagle feathers. </p><p> Having completed these preliminaries,</p><p>the belt was put around him and his talk </p><p>tied up in a bundle, and he set forth with </p><p>instructions to proceed, if need be, to the </p><p>ancient home of the Mohawks in the far </p><p>North, near the place where the sky vault </p><p>was constantly rising and falling to crush </p><p>those who presumed to venture beyond the </p><p>horizon’s rim. </p><p> It had not been necessary for him to visit</p><p>the Mohawk country, however, as repre- </p><p>sentatives of that tribe were gathered at </p><p>the Great Council Fire of the Five Nations </p><p>146 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>at Onondaga, the League’s seat of govern- </p><p>ment. It was the proudest moment of </p><p>his life when he addressed that illustrious </p><p>assemblage, Mohawk, Onondaga, Seneca, </p><p>Oneida and Cayuga. No warrior’s triumph </p><p>could equal his thrill of joy as he produced </p><p>the bag his talk was in and opened it. </p><p> When he made the symbolic fire of dry</p><p>elm, the light of which should be a beacon </p><p>to all tribes, he felt close kinship with the </p><p>gods. When he stripped the white hickory </p><p>bark, that the fire might be moved on it </p><p>from place to place and illumine all dark </p><p>comers of the league, the approbation of </p><p>the silent warriors stole over him like </p><p>incense. With impressive dignity he pre- </p><p>sented the wampum, showing one dish and </p><p>one spoon, signifying all tribes should eat </p><p>together in amity. W’ith great eloquence he </p><p>proclaimed his people’s desire to bur}' the </p><p>hatchet so deep no warrior of either nation </p><p>could ever dig it up again. </p><p> In concluding he had said:</p><p> “Blood has been spilled and must be</p><p>wiped up clean. Bones have been scattered </p><p>and must be collected and buried and </p><p>covered with white bark. Come fearlessly </p><p>to the Eldest Brother of the Nation (Ech- </p><p>ota) and you will always find the white </p><p>benches in place and the great white peace </p><p>pipe with its seven stems leaning against </p><p>them. The white wampum now hangs </p><p>between the Iroquois and my people. The </p><p>talk I have given I leave with you to give </p><p>to other tribes, who shall come to learn </p><p>what means the fire I have lighted.” </p><p> And he received peace belts in return</p><p>and set out for home, conscious he had </p><p>done well and stood high in the esteem </p><p>of the fierce Northern tribes, kinsmen and </p><p>ancient enemies of the Cherokee. </p><p> His exaltation abided with him till he</p><p>crossed the Potomac. Now that he was </p><p>nearing home and bringing momentous </p><p>news to the elders each eager stride should </p><p>have added to his climax of joy. But as he </p><p>pressed on through the blazing glory of </p><p>Autumnal woods he was dismayed to find </p><p>a vague unrest disturbing his mind. The </p><p>War Trail, which his eloquence and bearing</p><p>had turned into a Path of Peace, began to </p><p>oppress him. The red blush of the maples </p><p>suggested blood. He sought to diagnose </p><p>this morbid fancy, and instantly imagi- </p><p>nation began working and hinting at an </p><p>unknowable yet impending evil. </p><p> Such a mental attitude was preposterous,</p><p> reason told him—unless it be the malignant</p><p>work of a wizard or witch. That it might </p><p>be the natural reaction from a too long </p><p>sustained pitch of thought never entered his </p><p>calculations. White men as well as red </p><p>believed in witches and demons. The very </p><p>fact such notions could enter his head at </p><p>such a time was proof positive some </p><p>malicious agency was working against him. </p><p>But wizards and ghosts usually work </p><p>through a human medium, and there came </p><p>a day when he completely surrendered to </p><p>the strange obsession and left the trail </p><p>and doubled far back to satisfy himself the </p><p>Iroquois had not broken the faith by </p><p>sending warriors after him. </p><p> Ordinarily such a fear would be absurd,</p><p>for the talk given and received at Onondaga </p><p>was sacred. He was as safe among the </p><p>Five Nations as in his own home. But </p><p>evil spirits work through unsuspected </p><p>channels, and the instinct to guard against </p><p>a stealthy menace was overwhelming. A </p><p>second incredible situation developed when </p><p>he discovered he was confused as to his </p><p>exact whereabouts. </p><p> Such a ridiculous predicament could only</p><p>result from the work of the Little People, </p><p>who live in hollow trees and caves and </p><p>whose malice is confined to befuddling </p><p>tried warriors. He found the trail at </p><p>sunset and camped for the night, still </p><p>undecided as to which particular demon </p><p>the Little Folks were allied with. As he </p><p>brooded over the enigma a star left its </p><p>position and streamed away to the horizon, </p><p>showing it was no star at all, but a Fire- </p><p>Panther. What it boded he could not </p><p>imagine. </p><p> Early next morning he was afoot, the</p><p>calm of the never-ending forest pressing </p><p>upon him like the walls of a tent. The </p><p>occasional chatter of a tree-squirrel only </p><p>accented the silence. Once a chipmunk </p><p>ran up to him and he saluted it gravely </p><p>and accepted it as a sign of good luck.</p><p>For the Chipmunk was friendly to man. </p><p>He was clawed by a bear in a coun- </p><p>cil of the animals because he had dared </p><p>to speak a good word for men, and his </p><p>stripes are a constant reminder of that </p><p>loyalty. </p><p> Far above the forest crown sounded the</p><p>faint dugalu dugalu dugalu of the white- </p><p>breasted geese migrating south: Big Bear </p><p>envied them for their ease and swiftness of </p><p>flight and the wide spaces through which </p><p>The Raven Mocker </p><p>147 </p><p> they traveled with never a fear of an</p><p>ambush. </p><p> As he followed his trail of yesterday he</p><p>marveled at the careless marks his moc- </p><p>casins had left. Now he was moving like </p><p>a shadow and often examined the priming </p><p>of his gun. The lofty sentiments expressed </p><p>at Onondaga seemed to be far back in the </p><p>past. He had his bag of peace talk and </p><p>white wampum, but they were powerless </p><p>to oust the suspicion that some evil was </p><p>stalking him. Once a wolf startled him </p><p>by crossing the trail. He raised his gun </p><p>and all but fired before recognizing the </p><p>gray streak. He was very glad his eyes </p><p>had not completely tricked him, for wolves </p><p>are the watch-dogs of Kanati, the Lucky </p><p>Hunter, and it spoils a gun to shoot at one. </p><p> Midday found his superstitious mind</p><p>taking a new twist; he was loath to </p><p>advance, although he had not reached the </p><p>point where he had quit the trail to double </p><p>back. The consciousness of danger no </p><p>longer emanated from the rear, and, seem- </p><p>ingly, there was no logic in his tarrying. </p><p>He recognized this, but decided some sort </p><p>of an ambush awaited him down the trail. </p><p>If he waited a bit the ambush would be </p><p>lifted. </p><p> So again he camped with only half a</p><p>day’s journey completed, and that night </p><p>Wahuhu, the screech owl, began talking, </p><p>and with feminine persistency shouted the </p><p>same message over and over without giving </p><p>him an opportunity to ask any questions. </p><p>Other night-birds, through whom the ghosts </p><p>talk, joined in and derided him, but he could </p><p>discover no clue. A priest would have </p><p>learned the truth from them. </p><p> On resuming his journey in the morning</p><p>he took a new tack with his mind. He </p><p>firmly told himself— </p><p> “I will think of nothing but my Sister,</p><p>Little Feather, who dances like the sun- </p><p>beams and sings like the red bird.” </p><p> And so long as he crowded his mind with</p><p>thoughts of Little Feather and her winsome </p><p>sweetness he was at peace. </p><p> But concentration has its limits, and he</p><p>found himself declaring he was not afraid </p><p>of any enemy he could see. Nor did he </p><p>fear death. It was the inexplicable that </p><p>disturbed him and weakened his blood. </p><p>He wondered if by chance he had eaten </p><p>the flesh of a timid animal while among </p><p>the Iroquois. He knew he would be what </p><p>he ate. He had seen warriors become slow </p><p> and clumsy because they partook of waka,</p><p>the cow. </p><p>.ALL these meditations were ab- </p><p>ruptly terminated as through an </p><p>opening in the forest the sun cast </p><p>a vertical spear of light into the trail, and </p><p>caused his gaze to become fierce and </p><p>objective. The dazzling light brought out </p><p>in strong relief the signs of a trail entering </p><p>the war path from the west. The marks </p><p>were fresh and it was following the trail </p><p>he had made two days back. By doubling </p><p>toward the north he had unwittingly placed </p><p>the tracker before him. He quickened his </p><p>pace to maintain his advantage. </p><p> Doubtless it was a Shawnee, that tribe</p><p>being implacable in their hate since the </p><p>Cherokee drove them north of the Ohio </p><p>and wrested the Kentucky country from </p><p>them. This evidence of a tangible foe </p><p>turned Big Bear into a man-hunter. </p><p> Here was the explanation of his un-</p><p>willinghess to advance a full day’s journey </p><p>yesterday. The Fire-Pan ther was this </p><p>stealthy assassin. With his mind satisfied </p><p>on these points he shifted his gun to his left </p><p>hand and drew his ax. He preferred the </p><p>ax, although it came from the stpre-room </p><p>of Bridge, the trader, who had debauched </p><p>many young braves of the nation with his </p><p>strong rum. Only one fear now remained; </p><p>that the newcomer would discover where </p><p>he left the trail and understand Iris quarry </p><p>was behind, not before, him. But the </p><p>next bend in the ancient path brought him </p><p>in sight of the tracker. </p><p> He glided noiselessly forward, ' his ax</p><p>upraised, and sharply yelled— </p><p> “Ku! (Now!)”</p><p> With a snarl the figure straightened and</p><p>wheeled, and Big Bear was nonplussed to </p><p>recognize a Cherokee from the Lower</p><p>Towns, who had taken to living' at the </p><p>white man’s fort near the Cherokee settle- </p><p>ment on Big Pigeon River. </p><p> “The Whistler!” exclaimed Big Bear,</p><p>his arm falling to his side. “Did you think </p><p>you were following a Shawnee?” </p><p> The Whistler came toward him, saying—</p><p>“It is Yanegwa, returned from the Great </p><p>Council Fire of the Iroquois.” </p><p> Big Bear smiled amiably. The Whistler</p><p>was very welcome, for his presence proved </p><p>the Fire-Panther was a liar and that </p><p>Wahuhu had nothing but old woman’s talk </p><p>to tell. Some evil spirit had sought to </p><p>148 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>trap him and had failed. Yet he could not </p><p>resist jibing— </p><p> “The Whistler has lived with the whites</p><p>so long and drank so much of their strong </p><p>water his eyes have grown dim, or he would </p><p>have known a Shawnee would not leave a </p><p>trail a cow could follow.” </p><p> The Whistler drew back his lips in a little</p><p>snarl, his eyes glowing. He knew his </p><p>kinsmen viewed him with contempt because </p><p>of his continued association with the </p><p>whites. But English rum was fiery and </p><p>had bought many a better man than he. </p><p>As he drew very close Big Bear caught the </p><p>taint of his breath and stepped back. The </p><p>delinquent’s presence seemed to poison the </p><p>cool, clean woods. </p><p> “I knew I was following Yanegwa’s trail,”</p><p>said the Whistler, advancing. </p><p> Big Bear laughed.</p><p> “Were my people troubled about me?</p><p>Did they send the brave Whistler to find </p><p>me? Why was he bending over my tracks </p><p>as though following a war trail?” </p><p> “He followed Yanegwa to kill him!”</p><p>hissed the Whistler, striking with his </p><p>knife. </p><p> Although taken completely off his guard</p><p>Big Bear’s instinct of self-preservation </p><p>asserted itself automatically. The ax he </p><p>was replacing in his belt was jerked upward </p><p>a few inches and the knife glanced from the </p><p>flat side of the head. </p><p> Instantly the two clinched, clutching</p><p>each other’s right wrists. Much rum and </p><p>soft living, however, had made the Whistler </p><p>flabby, and as they fell to the ground Big </p><p>Bear secured the advantage. Even then he </p><p>would have spared his assailant, thinking </p><p>him bereft of his senses; but as he loosened </p><p>his grip the knife leaped upward. At the </p><p>cost of a slashed wrist Big Bear caught it </p><p>and violently forced it downward. </p><p> Coughing hideously, and done for, the</p><p>Whistler relaxed. In sorrow and disgust </p><p>Big Bear stared at the crumpled figure.</p><p>Far overhead came an eery sound, the </p><p>note of a raven “diving,” and not at all </p><p>resembling the raven’s usual cry. Both </p><p>Indians recognized it as the voice of </p><p>Kalanu Ahyeliski, the Raven Mocker, </p><p>that terrible wizard or witch that hovers </p><p>over the sick and dying to rob them of life. </p><p>It usually flies through the heavens in fiery </p><p>shape and all other witches and demons </p><p>scatter at its approach; jealous yet afraid </p><p>of it. It was no Fire-Panther that Big </p><p>Bear had seen, but the Raven Mocker </p><p>hurrying to be in at a death. </p><p> “Kalanu Ahyeliski!” gasped the Whistler,</p><p>staring wildly up into the forest tops. </p><p>“Keep it away!” </p><p> “I have no medicine,” shivered Big Bear.</p><p> “Stay with me, or the Mocker will eat</p><p>my heart. If you stay it may keep away. </p><p>If you bury me quick it can not get </p><p>me.” </p><p> “I have no medicine,” repeated Big Bear,</p><p>fighting mightily to overcome his impulse </p><p>to flee. </p><p> “You come from a great peace talk; that</p><p>may be medicine. You have floated in the </p><p>magic crystal; that must be medicine.” </p><p> “I can not help you,” shuddered Big</p><p>Bear. </p><p> For he knew the Raven Mocker, being</p><p>invisible, even then might be standing at </p><p>his side. He expected to behold the </p><p>Whistler’s body leap into the air as the </p><p>demon seized it. </p><p> “Stay!” panted The Whistler. “Bridge</p><p>sent me—to kill you. Little-” </p><p> The death-rattle cut him short.</p><p> Dazed by the horror of it all Big Bear</p><p>could only remember .that the Raven </p><p>Mocker could not violate a grave. He </p><p>frantically scooped out a hollow in the </p><p>forest mold and covered up the dead man. </p><p>Then he ran as though pursued by a legion </p><p>of demons. Not till far into the night did </p><p>his mind clear and permit him to think </p><p>connectedly. The Whistler’s dying words </p><p>had lodged fast in his brain and now de-</p><p>manded attention. He reviewed them and </p><p>found them incredible. Why should Bridge, </p><p>autocrat though he was, seek the life of a </p><p>bearer of belts, a man he had scarcely seen? </p><p>Yet how could a man in his death throes </p><p>and while the Raven Mocker crouched at </p><p>his side speak with a forked tongue? </p><p>IT WAS early evening when Big </p><p>Bear halted at the Big Pigeon and </p><p>gazed long at the Great Smoky </p><p>range. One peak in particular had his </p><p>reverence, Kuwahi, “the mulberry place.” </p><p>There, White Bear, chief of all the bears, </p><p>lived near the enchanted lake of Atagahi, </p><p>where wounded bears went to bathe and </p><p>be cured of their hurts. The Cherokee </p><p>knew that beyond their physical structure </p><p>there was little difference between animals </p><p>and men. In fact, the bear was part human </p><p>as shown by his habit of standing erect </p><p>The Raven Mocker </p><p>149 </p><p>In the old days they had worked and lived </p><p>together. Like the Indians the animals </p><p>had their tribes and elected chiefs. They </p><p>had their town houses, where they held </p><p>councils. They shared with man the </p><p>same destiny in the Twilight Land of </p><p>Usunhiyi. </p><p> On the lower slopes a ribbon of red was</p><p>crawling upward, writhing like a gigantic </p><p>snake, where the women and children </p><p>were burning the dead leaves to get the </p><p>nuts underneath. Big Bear had been </p><p>homesick for such sights ever since traveling </p><p>to the North country. No water could </p><p>ever taste like the water from the Big </p><p>Pigeon, no nights so mellow arid starry </p><p>as those over the Great Smoky. And yet </p><p>the mumbled words of a would-be assassin </p><p>had poisoned Big Bear’s home-coming. </p><p> The sinister problem was ever worrying</p><p>him. He had nothing Bridge could want. </p><p>The trader was a friend of officers at the </p><p>fort and gambled and drank with them and </p><p>loaned them money. He had nothing in </p><p>common with the Cherokee Nation, his </p><p>relations being confined to exchanging </p><p>poor guns and strong rum for dressed deer- </p><p>skins and other articles of barter. </p><p> Big Bear had seen him many times, a</p><p>heavily-built man showing the effects of </p><p>gross living. But he did- not believe </p><p>Bridge knew him by sight. The trader </p><p>seldom visited the Cherokee towns these </p><p>days, having reached a plane of affluence. </p><p>He had a plantation and trading-house near </p><p>the fort and transacted his business there. </p><p>Much of his time was spent in carousing </p><p>with the officers. No; it could not be as </p><p>The Whistler had said. The Whistler had </p><p>lost his reason from fear of the Raven </p><p>Mocker. He had spoken crazy words. </p><p> Determined to accept this conclusion</p><p>Big Bear resumed his journey, eager to be </p><p>welcomed by Little Feather. As he ran </p><p>up the river path he discerned a tall figure </p><p>approaching at a swift pace. Anywhere </p><p>between the Ohio and Savannah he would </p><p>have recognized that loping gait; and he </p><p>joyously called out: </p><p> “The Path-Killer! I come, Yanegwa.”</p><p> The Path-Killer fairly skimmed over the</p><p>trail to embrace him, but Big Bear’s heart </p><p>grew cold with a premonition of disaster as </p><p>his sworn friend gripped him by the </p><p>shoulders and spoke never a word of wel- </p><p>come. </p><p> “What is it?” whispered Big Bear, push-</p><p>ing his friend back and seeking to read his </p><p>face through the gloom. </p><p> “I prayed the mighty Adawehi would tell</p><p>you. I can not. Ask me of those you love </p><p>and I will answer. But it takes the life </p><p>out of me,” choked The Path-Killer. </p><p> “Little Feather?” muttered Big Bear,</p><p>the fingers of death squeezing his heart. </p><p> The Path-Killer took his arm and swung</p><p>him about and pointed to the west, where </p><p>a faint touch of pink was left behind by </p><p>the sun. </p><p> “She is there,” he whispered.</p><p> “She has gone to Usunhiyi,” moaned</p><p>Big Bear. </p><p> “To Usunhiyi—‘Where-It-Is-Ever-Grow-</p><p>ing-Dark’—The Twilight Land.” </p><p> “When did she die?”</p><p> “Seven nights ago. Little Feather!</p><p>Little Feather!” And with a groan of </p><p>anguish the Path-Killer stretched out his </p><p>arms to the spirit land, where go the dead. </p><p> “She was well when I went away. What</p><p>sickness came to our people?” </p><p> The Path-Killer became a warrior, burn-</p><p>ing for vengeance, as he harshly replied: </p><p>“She fell or jumped off the high ledge </p><p>near the fort while escaping from Bridge, </p><p>the trader. He stole her and took her to </p><p>his house but she escaped. He and his men </p><p>gave chase.” </p><p> “Bridge—sent me—to kill you. Lit-</p><p>tle—" </p><p> Big Bear now understood The Whistler’s</p><p>dying words. </p><p> He held up his ax and kissed the blade</p><p>and in a calm voice asked— </p><p> “Who were with Bridge?”</p><p> “Two officers and two of his workmen.</p><p>I have killed the workmen. The others </p><p>are hard to get at.” </p><p> “May the Raven Mocker be near when</p><p>they die, which must be very soon,” prayed </p><p>Big Bear over the ax. </p><p> “I have stalked them close, but they</p><p>either stay at the fort or shut themselves </p><p>up at the plantation,” sighed the Path- </p><p>Killer. “They know something is on their </p><p>trail. They dare not go about. The </p><p>council would send a force against them </p><p>but I made the chiefs wait till you could </p><p>come.” </p><p> “It is not work for any but Yanegwa,</p><p>her brother, and the man whose wife she </p><p>was to be. There shall never be while </p><p>wampum between me and the white </p><p>settlers.” </p><p>Adventure </p><p>THE trader always had considered </p><p>Indians as inferior animals; to be </p><p>exploited for gain, or exterminated </p><p>if they got in the way. That they ex- </p><p>perienced the gamut of human emotions </p><p>never entered his head. Little Feather, </p><p>an uncommonly attractive Indian girl, had </p><p>appealed to his brutal fancy the moment </p><p>his bloodshot gaze beheld her. She had </p><p>repulsed his brusk advances. But posses- </p><p>sion had simply meant the taking; so he </p><p>called in two of his officer cronies to par- </p><p>ticipate in the lark, and gave orders to his </p><p>henchmen. That the wench should spoil </p><p>his sport by escaping and falling or jumping </p><p>to her death was a fault he should always </p><p>hold against the whole Cherokee Nation. </p><p>He declared as much over his glass as he sat </p><p>with his friends and discussed the tragedy. </p><p> The finding of one of his employees dead</p><p>the day following the girl’s death turned </p><p>him into a fiend and he swore in horrible </p><p>oaths the punishment he would mete out. </p><p>The discovery of the second dead body ten </p><p>hours later suggested that some one had </p><p>started a system of accumulative revenge </p><p>and weakened his ferocity. He was not </p><p>accustomed to meet those who struck back. </p><p> He drank much raw rum in brooding</p><p>over the second death and had worked </p><p>himself into a mental state bordering on </p><p>a panic when his two friends rode over </p><p>from the fort to take action on the double </p><p>killing. They were for calling out the </p><p>soldiers and raiding the town. But Bridge </p><p>dissented. </p><p> “That would start another war and stop</p><p>my profits,” he moodily grunted. “Keep </p><p>quiet. I’ll see some of the headmen and </p><p>fix it up. It’ll cost a pretty bale of cloth, </p><p>but better that than to stir up the whole </p><p>nation.” </p><p> “Perhaps they’ve let enough blood to</p><p>square it,” hopefully suggested Finsin, a rat- </p><p>eyed heir of a wealthy planter. </p><p> “Two dead men ought to be enough for</p><p>any Injun woman on the continent,” </p><p>growled Bursen, whose impudence and </p><p>daring supplied the place of a rich father. </p><p>“Curse them for a devilish breed! If the </p><p>Government would pay a decent price for </p><p>their hair we’d clean them up inside a year.</p><p>Massachusetts has been paying a hundred </p><p>pounds for a scalp. Godfrey! What pick- </p><p>ings! Put that price on down here, Bridge, </p><p>and I’ll have pounds to your shillings and </p><p>pay what I owe you to boot.” </p><p> Bridge studied his glass morosely as he</p><p>said: </p><p> “Wish it could be settled without a fuss.</p><p>Got to have Injuns to make profits. You’d </p><p>better quarter a score of your soldiers over </p><p>here. My men are getting silly—some of </p><p>them got Injun women who fill them up </p><p>with their-ghost yarns.” </p><p> “I’ll detail some men for outpost duty</p><p>here,” readily agreed Bursen. Then rais- </p><p>ing his glass he mockingly cried, “Speaking </p><p>of ghosts, here’s to the hussy that was </p><p>fool enough to prefer the river to your </p><p>caresses.” </p><p> “Don’t!” shouted the trader. “That is;</p><p>I’m unstrung.” </p><p> “I should say you are,” jeered Finsin,</p><p>eying him in surprise. “What’s a dead </p><p>Injun?” </p><p> Bridge rose and examined the fastenings</p><p>of the heavily-barred shutters. He was </p><p>conscious of his companions’ curious </p><p>scrutiny as he returned to the table and </p><p>fell into his chair. </p><p> “I’m shut up here alone except when you</p><p>chaps call,” he muttered. “Gits on my </p><p>nerves—that and the rum. Can’t help </p><p>hearing the Injun women’s talk—creepy.” </p><p>“As to what?” urged Bursen, winking at </p><p>his companion. </p><p> Bridge started to pour out a drink, paused</p><p>and spilled the liquor on the table and </p><p>raised a hand for attention. It was a </p><p>weird night sound. </p><p> “Owl,” mumbled Finsin. “Think it was</p><p>a war-whoop?” </p><p> “The wench come back to haunt you,”</p><p>maliciously suggested Bursen. </p><p> “Neither ghosts nor war-whoops can</p><p>make my hand shake like that,” hoarsely </p><p>assured Bridge, holding up his heavy hand</p><p>and studying the twitching fingers. </p><p>“What’n - do you suppose causes </p><p>that? I ain’t drunk. Ever hear them </p><p>Injun yams about the Raven Mocker?” </p><p>Bursen laughed loudly and demanded— </p><p>“Who hasn’t?” </p><p> He affected to speak in huge disgust,</p><p>yet his glance traveled toward the window. </p><p> “They have a pleasant trick of eating</p><p>the heart of the dying. Medicine-men coil </p><p>the great invisible serpent ’round the </p><p>house to keep them out. Even that isn’t </p><p>a sure remedy.” </p><p> “Get two serpents,” advised Finsin with</p><p>a maudlin grin. </p><p> “Some things about their medicine we</p><p>The Raven Mocker </p><p>151 </p><p>whites don’t understand,” grunted Bridge. </p><p> “Some things about their Raven Mocker</p><p>their priests don’t understand,” added </p><p>Bursen. “In coiling the serpent the priest </p><p>must leave an opening between the head </p><p>and tail where you can go in and out. </p><p>Otherwise the medicine isn’t any good. </p><p>And there’s nothing to stop the Raven </p><p>Mocker from entering through the gap. </p><p>I’ve listened to that rot ever since I came </p><p>to the Colonies.” </p><p>“I’m in no mood to talk about it,” </p><p>mumbled Bridge. “Let’s have the cards.” </p><p>“I thank you, but no,” refused Bursen, </p><p>rising and bowing with exaggerated polite- </p><p>ness. “Your amiable mood, worthy friend, </p><p>would give you -able luck. And I </p><p>can’t afford to lose any more just at present. </p><p>Wish they’d offer a decent scalp bounty </p><p>so us poor devils could get in funds. I’m </p><p>for the fort. Coming, Finsin?” </p><p> Finsin looked longingly at the bottle.</p><p>Bridge urged him to stay all night, but, </p><p>not relishing to return alone in the morning, </p><p>he muttered an oath and staggered to his </p><p>feet. Bridge hurriedly gulped down a </p><p>lrink and swore he would accompany them </p><p>and look for a game at the fort, but a </p><p>recurrence of the night-cry suddenly damp- </p><p>ened his enthusiasm and he gruffly bade </p><p>them good night from the table. </p><p> After they had gone he felt uneasy and&gt;</p><p>even imagined something was watching </p><p>him through the oak shutters. He knew </p><p>such spying was impossible but the notion </p><p>persisted till he rang for his superintend- </p><p>ent to keep him company. The super- </p><p>intendent eagerly assailed the bottle, con- </p><p>tent to sit in silence while his master </p><p>brooded over the stubbornness of the In- </p><p>dian character. </p><p> “Why the devil don’t you say some-</p><p>thing?” he finally roared. “Where’s The </p><p>Whistler?” </p><p> “Dead,” was the laconic reply.</p><p> “Dead?” faintly screamed Bridge, bounc-</p><p>ing to his feet. </p><p> “Lor’, sir! I didn’t ’low you’d be inter-</p><p>ested. He’s only a Injun,” meekly replied </p><p>the superintendent. “Found dead on the </p><p>Big War Trail. Been buried but some wild </p><p>things had dug him out.” </p><p> Bridge sank limply into his chair and</p><p>endeavored to make his voice sound </p><p>natural as he said— </p><p> “Prob’ly a Shawnee raiding band caught</p><p>him.” </p><p> The superintendent shook his head em-</p><p>phatically, saying: </p><p> “He had his hair. No Shawnee would ’a’</p><p>left that. Seems to have been killed by </p><p>his own knife, jest like he done for hisself. </p><p>Mebbe he did.” </p><p> “He didn’t bury himself,” whispered</p><p>Bridge, wiping the water from his forehead. </p><p>“What do the Cherokee think?” </p><p> The superintendent shifted uneasily;</p><p>then retorted. </p><p> “They’s a crazy lot. Wouldn’t send a</p><p>party out to scout around—seem to think </p><p>the witches done it. Killed him and buried </p><p>him so the Raven Mocker couldn’t git him. </p><p>They believe all the witches and devils are </p><p>scared of the Raven Mocker and hate it so </p><p>they’ll bury a man jest out of spite. Now </p><p>I ’low-” </p><p> “Shut up that cursed babbling!” cried</p><p>Bridge, thumping the table. “Has Yan- </p><p>egwa got back yet?” </p><p> “Not yet, sir. He’s overdue, too. The</p><p>Path-Killer went to meet him. Fath- </p><p>Killer was sweet—erhum.” </p><p> “Go on!”</p><p> “Well, he was sweet on Yanegwa’s</p><p>sister.” This very apologetically. </p><p> “Huh!” exclaimed Bridge, his eyes glis-</p><p>tening. Leaning over the table he hissed, </p><p>“Fifty pounds for the Path-Killer’s head. </p><p>But it must be done quickly.” </p><p> “Money’s good as earned if he ever shows</p><p>up,” eagerly assured the superintendent. </p><p>“I’ll look for him in the morning. Hark! </p><p>Some one’s coming.” And he rose and </p><p>stepped to the window and threw open </p><p>the shutter before Bridge could stop him. </p><p> Several of the servants were huddled in</p><p>front of the house holding pine-knot </p><p>torches. Down the trail beyond the cleared </p><p>ground a voice was softly chanting. The </p><p>night, the dancing shadows cast by the </p><p>torches, the fear in his own mind, caused </p><p>the trader to shiver as though cold. Yet </p><p>he could not summon the will power to </p><p>order the shutter closed. He had to stand </p><p>there and glare out into the darkness and </p><p>witness what was to happen. The chanting </p><p>was scarcely audible, no words being dis- </p><p>tinguishable. Low and monotonous it kept </p><p>on, drawing nearer and nearer. Then two </p><p>vague shapes broke through the darkness </p><p>and into the rim of the torch zone and came </p><p>ambling up the driveway. </p><p> With a shrill laugh of relief the super-</p><p>intendent informed them: </p><p>152 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “The officers, sir, merry from drink. I</p><p>could tell their hosses anywhere. They’ve </p><p>come back to make a night of it. They’ve </p><p>stopped singing.” </p><p> The horses made for the lights and the</p><p>familiar doorway. The men below began </p><p>exclaiming in horror and amazement as </p><p>the torches revealed dead men lurching </p><p>across the withers of their mounts. As </p><p>they lifted them to the ground and straight- </p><p>ened them out under the window Bridge </p><p>gave a low cry of abject terror. </p><p> The superintendent feebly cried:</p><p> “Dead and not scalped—waistcoats cut</p><p>to ribbons! Oh, Lor’! No witches was </p><p>’round to bury ’em in time!” </p><p>A DELEGATION of chiefs from </p><p>the Cherokee town visited the fort </p><p>and petitioned that a band of </p><p>soldiers be sent with their young men after </p><p>the marauding Shawnee to punish them </p><p>for slaying The Whistler and the two </p><p>officers. The commander assented and </p><p>dispatched a body of scouts to cooperate </p><p>with the warriors. But Bridge was con- </p><p>fident no Shawnee would be overtaken on </p><p>the Great War Trail. </p><p> So he remained closely guarded in his</p><p>house, fear and rum his hourly companions. </p><p>His superintendent obtained a small num- </p><p>ber of soldiers to reinforce the plantation </p><p>guards, and these made merry in the cook- </p><p>house or boisterously patrolled the grounds </p><p>at night. The trader sat at the table, </p><p>sometimes dozing off, more often awake </p><p>and clutching the bottle and a pistol, and </p><p>quaking at every sound. The days passed </p><p>and nothing happened. Inquiries made </p><p>through the Indian women frequenting </p><p>the plantation elicited no news of Yanegwa </p><p>or the Path-Killer. Their tribesmen be- </p><p>lieved both had been killed, said the women. </p><p> The superintendent accepted this theory.</p><p>The two had been slain by the same warrior, </p><p>or band, that killed The Whistler and the </p><p>officers. The Shawnee had hoped to escape </p><p>suspicion by refraining from scalping their </p><p>victims. Probably there were but very </p><p>few in the Shawnee band, and they hoped</p><p>to hide in the cane and hills and pick off </p><p>a victim now and then. Two Mohawk </p><p>braves once remained hidden near one of the </p><p>Lower Towns for a space of four moons and </p><p>stealthily killed till the nation believed it </p><p>to be the work of witches. </p><p> Satisfied the Path-Killer was dead the</p><p>superintendent quietly murdered an Indian, </p><p>represented it was Little Feather’s lover, </p><p>and collected his fifty pounds. Never had </p><p>the trader paid out money so willingly. </p><p>He was convinced Big Bear was dead, and </p><p>the passing of the Path-Killer to the </p><p>Twilight Land rolled a mighty load from </p><p>his heart. With brutal jocosity he re- </p><p>marked, after paying over the blood-price— </p><p> “The three of them can talk things over.”</p><p> “No doubt but what Big Bear’s dead,”</p><p>murmured the superintendent. </p><p> The trader’s eyes took alarm, and he</p><p>said— </p><p> “If he ain’t I’ll give a hundred pounds for</p><p>his head.” </p><p> “I’ll fetch in the heads of the whole</p><p>nation at that rate,” cried the super- </p><p>intendent. </p><p>HIDDEN in a small cave near some </p><p>falls on the Big Pigeon, where the </p><p>voice of the Thunderers spoke to </p><p>them day and night in wise council, Big </p><p>Bear and his friend essayed to devise a plan </p><p>whereby they could come upon the trader </p><p>when he was alone. Night after night they </p><p>reconnoitered the house seeking an en- </p><p>trance. To avoid the drunken soldiers </p><p>was child’s play, but to gain admission to </p><p>the trader’s living-quarters without a great </p><p>display of force seemed to be impossible. </p><p> There were times when they could have</p><p>slain at a distance, providing their medicine </p><p>was strong. These opportunities came </p><p>each day when the trader stepped to the </p><p>front door and whistled for his favorite </p><p>horse. The intelligent animal was allowed </p><p>to run free, his master’s signal always </p><p>bringing him to the house on the gallop. </p><p>It was the one trait in the trader’s brutal </p><p>make-up that savored of humanism; he </p><p>loved the horse.</p><p> These were the only occasions when he</p><p>showed himself, and never then except as </p><p>he was surrounded by his men and the </p><p>soldiers. A long shot might bring him </p><p>down, but such an anonymous killing would </p><p>not satisfy the Cherokee. Both had sworn </p><p>on Big Bear’s ax that the trader should </p><p>know his slayer and the cause of his death. </p><p> “It is talked in the village that he is</p><p>killing himself with fear,” said the Path- </p><p>Killer. </p><p> “Fear is good but he must not die alone,”</p><p>replied Big Bear. “I would not have him </p><p>die by his own hand. Little Feather’s </p><p>The Raven Mocker </p><p>153 </p><p>death was dean. His must be bloody.” </p><p>“When he leaves the house we will follow </p><p>and catch him unguarded,” consoled the </p><p>Path-Killer. </p><p> “But he never leaves his house. Each</p><p>day I fear to hear he has killed himself, or </p><p>died quietly in bed.” </p><p> “He must leave some day. He will grow</p><p>weary of being alone and will start for the </p><p>fort. He will whistle to his horse and </p><p>mount it and dart away with his men </p><p>behind him. Some day he will come to </p><p>the door, dressed for the trail. We must </p><p>always be ready to follow.” </p><p> “My brother speaks medicine words,”</p><p>softly exulted Big Bear. “He will watch </p><p>the house tonight alone while I find the </p><p>horse and make friends with him.” </p><p>“Adawehi helps us!” cried the Path- </p><p>Killer, his gaze lighting with inspiration. </p><p>“May your medicine be mighty enough to </p><p>call the horse to us when his master would </p><p>ride him to the fort!” </p><p> Big Bear shook his head, saying:</p><p> “The priests might do it. The old</p><p>people could do it, but not Yanegwa. He </p><p>who can drive the Raven Mocker away </p><p>could do it, but Yanegwa is only a warrior.” </p><p>“Yanegwa’s medicine is strong enough </p><p>to drive the trader from his house,” the </p><p>Path-Killer insisted. “One of the corn </p><p>women told me last night he is afraid of </p><p>the Mocker. He does not believe it was a </p><p>Shawnee who killed the officers. He be- </p><p>lieves it was a Mocker. All his men know </p><p>his fears.” </p><p> “He hired The Whistler to kill me,”</p><p>murmured Big Bear, his eyes blank as he </p><p>groped for the big idea. “It was The </p><p>Whistler who taught him to call his horse </p><p>by whistling. He fears the Raven Mocker. </p><p>Kul I know it now. Our medicine shall </p><p>drive him into the open. I, Yanegwa, </p><p>who carried the bundle of peace talk to the </p><p>Five Nations, say it!” </p><p>STRANGE talk was whispered </p><p>about the plantation, much of </p><p>which seeped into the master’s</p><p>apartment and set him to shivering. It </p><p>was said many Raven Mockers were hover- </p><p>ing ’round the place. Their cries could be </p><p>heard each night. Some life must soon go </p><p>out to attract such numbers of the wizards. </p><p>Lesser witches and devils, in the shape of </p><p>black clouds, had been seen retreating over </p><p>the Great Smoky Mountains, frightened </p><p>from their mediocre mischief by the </p><p>Mockers. </p><p> “Such-rot,” mumbled Bridge, after</p><p>pumping his superintendent about the cook- </p><p>house gossip. “Keep them women off the </p><p>plantation. What’s the matter with you? </p><p>You look silly ’round the gills.” </p><p> “It’s their ghost yams, sir. It’s all I’ve</p><p>heard for a week.” </p><p> “The Path-Killer’s spirit after you, eh?”</p><p>And the trader grinned wolfishly in thinking </p><p>he had a companion in fear. “What do </p><p>those women say about the priests keeping </p><p>the Raven Mockers away? Not that </p><p>there’s anything in it. Yet we don’t </p><p>understand just what the priests can do.” </p><p>“They coil a big serpent about a house, </p><p>but have to leave an opening between the </p><p>head and tail-” </p><p> “Shut up! Bursen was talking that</p><p>guff—the night he was done for. Curse </p><p>this country and its silly tales! Get things </p><p>ready for me to go to the fort.” </p><p> “Hoke can run things while we’re gone,”</p><p>eagerly suggested the superintendent, who </p><p>believed a trip to the fort might ease his </p><p>thoughts of the Indian he had murdered. </p><p> “While we're gone?” scoffed the trader.</p><p>“Who the devil are you, anyway? Drink- </p><p>ing out the same bottle don’t make us </p><p>equals, my man. You’ll stick here.” </p><p> After the superintendent sullenly tcok</p><p>his departure the trader outlined his plans. </p><p>He would hire a new superintendent, and </p><p>then go North and keep clear of the witch- </p><p>ridden country. He regretted he had not </p><p>gone to the fort before. Cautiously un- </p><p>fastening the shutters he peered out at the </p><p>west and whispered: </p><p> “Usunhiyi. Where-It-Is-Always-Grow-</p><p>ing-Dark—I didn’t send the little fool there. </p><p>Besides, we were all drunk.” </p><p> That night employees, soldiers and</p><p>hangers-on heard a Raven Mocker over the </p><p>house; not one voice, but many. There </p><p>was no sleep in the help’s quarters; there </p><p>was no sleep in the master’s apartment. </p><p>The weird cries circled the plantation, </p><p>now sounding in the depths of the forest, </p><p>now calling from the tilled fields and out- </p><p>houses. And toward morning it rang with </p><p>ear-splitting violence close to the shuttered </p><p>window and brought the trader to his feet, </p><p>the dew of death on his flabby face. Sun- </p><p>rise found him fully dressed but helpless </p><p>from liquor. </p><p> He came to his senses late in the afternoon</p><p>154 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>and remembered the experiences of the </p><p>night. He could not pass through such </p><p>another night. Shaking and trembling he </p><p>dragged himself from bed and rang for the </p><p>superintendent. </p><p> “I’m leaving for the fort as soon as I can</p><p>get my papers in order. Have the soldiers </p><p>ready and six of my best woodsmen.” </p><p>“Shall the men catch your hoss?” </p><p>“They’d have a fine run for it. I’ll call </p><p>the horse when I’m ready. Git out!” </p><p> The Twilight Land had reluctantly sur-</p><p>rendered its last bit of gold and the steel- </p><p>blue of the mountains had changed to sullen </p><p>gray before the trader finished arranging </p><p>his papers. Bursen’s I. O. U.’s went into </p><p>the flames as worthless, but Finsin’s were </p><p>saved on the chance his father might pay. </p><p>Stars gleamed and the dusk was stalking </p><p>up from the river when the trader de- </p><p>scended to the hall and made sure his guard </p><p>was ready and waiting. As he opened the </p><p>outer door a nerve-racking cry came from </p><p>the direction of the Cherokee town. The </p><p>men heard it without their usual ribald jest. </p><p> The trader raised a silver whistle and</p><p>blew a signal. The Mocker called again, </p><p>this time much nearer. In a panic lest </p><p>the evil voice get between him and the fort </p><p>Bridge whistled a second time and pro- </p><p>longed the call- A crackling of under- </p><p>bush and the whinny of his horse answered, </p><p>and his fear that some harm had befallen </p><p>the animal subsided. Now the horse was </p><p>cantering across a field. Once mounted, </p><p>with the trail open before him, Bridge vowed </p><p>be would defy the devil himself to overtake </p><p>him. He snatched up the bridle and saddle </p><p>from the horse block and called impatiently </p><p>to the horse. The animal whinnied and </p><p>pranced about, but seemed reluctant to </p><p>approach. </p><p> “Stand back with those torches! You</p><p>frighten him,” Bridge yelled to the soldiers </p><p>who held lighted pine-knots. </p><p> The guard drew off to one side. The</p><p>horse sprang forward like a bolt. What </p><p>next happened was never described the </p><p>same by any two of the onlookers. When</p><p>the steed raced up to the block Bridge </p><p>caught him about the neck and lifted the </p><p>bridle. Then he gave a startled yell and </p><p>seemed to vault across the animal’s withers. </p><p>Back to the woods galloped the horse. </p><p> Some of the men swore they heard the</p><p>trader cry out the name of Yanegwa. </p><p>Others were equally positive he shouted </p><p>the name of Little Feather, who had died </p><p>to escape him. Only on one point did they </p><p>agree: that his horse carried him to the </p><p>edge of the wood and that, inasmuch as </p><p>his heart was torn out before they could </p><p>gain his side, a Raven Mocker must have </p><p>got him. </p><p> RIVERS</p><p> BY RICHARD BUTLER. GLAENZER</p><p>FROM where the Mississippi’s blue to where it’s delta-brown, </p><p>I know each bend, each levee, bluff and bayou up and down. </p><p>I know the Colorado and its canoned rainbow cliffs; </p><p>And the Nile, awake or dozing, devious as its hieroglyphs; </p><p>And the somber, snaky Congo, writhing, reeking, as it crawls; </p><p>The Parana and Iguazu up to its double falls; </p><p>The Yang-tse of the Gorges and that juggler, the Hoang-Ho; </p><p>The Volga and the Murray and the Amazon I know: </p><p>Rivers that water and feed the world, and yet not one stands out </p><p>As grandly as the nameless brook where I caught my first small trout. </p><p>Author of “Safe and Satie, </p><p>HE general in command of that </p><p>difficult and important little </p><p>wedge which nosed into the </p><p>flat ground before the Hautebois </p><p>woods sat in his headquarters cave im- </p><p>mersed in a sea of maps and surrounded </p><p>by an alert gathering of staff officers and </p><p>telephone operators. Out of the vaulted </p><p>dimness to the right a field-telegraph </p><p>clicked incessantly. The general stabbed </p><p>angrily with his compass point at a spot </p><p>colored red on the map before him. </p><p> “Ces sales Bodies iht” he spat, through</p><p>his bristly grizzly mustache. “Always </p><p>they appear to have knowledge of what we </p><p>purpose. Ss-s-saprist ’1” </p><p> He swung in his chair and turned to a tall</p><p>officer who wore the coveted device of the </p><p>double wings. He addressed him in Eng- </p><p>lish. </p><p> “Meestaire Reynold’, you will ’ave ze</p><p>goodness, yes, and send up one of your so </p><p>brave boys to make obsairvation wis all </p><p>speed.” </p><p> “Tout’ suite, tnon General.” Captain</p><p>Reynolds saluted and strode from the </p><p>dug-out. </p><p> Outside he jumped into one of the swift</p><p>autos distinguished by the tiny staff pen- </p><p>nant and indicated the hangars half a mile </p><p>distant. In another minute he was among </p><p>his own boys of the Escadrille. No need </p><p>to explain which escadrille, there is but one, </p><p>those hard-flying, hard-fighting young ad- </p><p>” “Sense of Balance," etc. </p><p>venturers to whom even the French aviators </p><p>take off their hats. </p><p>For extreme accuracy it might be added </p><p>that Captain Reynolds was in command </p><p>of Flight D which had been specially </p><p>detailed to that important section. In his </p><p>little office partitioned off from the quarters </p><p>he consulted a memorandum sheet of daily </p><p>operations; then he stepped out and </p><p>crooked his finger at a lithe, brown-faced </p><p>young man who jumped to meet him. </p><p>“Not exactly your turn, Mackensie; but </p><p>I want a good man. I wish you’d go up</p><p>and see if you can find out anything across </p><p>the line.” </p><p>Second Lieutenant Mackensie saluted </p><p>and ran out to his machine. At the door </p><p>he halted for a second. </p><p>“Observer?” he asked. </p><p>“No, make it a single hop; and hurry.” . </p><p>A moment later Reynolds followed him, </p><p>He was already climbing into his machine </p><p>while a mechanician spun the great pro- </p><p>peller. Reynolds called to him. </p><p>“Wind, twenty-seven; and strato-cumu- </p><p>lus, fifty-five hundred. </p><p>Mackensie glanced up at the clouds and </p><p>nodded quickly. Then to the mechan- </p><p>ician— </p><p>“All ready?” </p><p>“All ready, sir.” </p><p>“On!” </p><p>The mechanician heaved down on the </p><p>propeller blade and swung sharply clear to </p><p>156 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the right. The great fins spun twice with </p><p>a heavy blip blip and then swung stiffly </p><p>back to the horizontal. </p><p> “Off!” called Mackensie as he pressed</p><p>down on the ignition button. </p><p> The mechanician cranked the propeller</p><p>over for a few turns. </p><p> “On!”</p><p> “On!” said the mechanician and heaved</p><p>sharply down once more. </p><p> This time the engine caught up the</p><p>ignition with a roar. Mackensie wasted </p><p>no time in “wanning up.” </p><p> “Let her go!” he shouted.</p><p> The other mechanicians who were bracing</p><p>themselves against the thick entering-edge </p><p>of the great planes ducked quickly under, </p><p>and the machine shot away from them, </p><p>overcoming its inertia with unbelievable </p><p>speed under the tremendous thrust of its </p><p>hundred and fifty horse-power engine. </p><p>Almost immediately Mackensie pulled back </p><p>on the elevating controls, and without a </p><p>bump the great machine glided into its own </p><p>element. Mackensie drew out the gas </p><p>lever to the last notch and pulled the </p><p>control almost to his chest. The machine </p><p>pointed its nose to the sky and whirled the </p><p>blue smoke from the exhaust to fan out </p><p>against the grass. </p><p> “Whew! He’ll tail-slide if he don’t watch</p><p>out,” gasped a mechanician. </p><p> But Lieutenant Mackensie knew his</p><p>machine as he knew his own soul. In less </p><p>than five minutes he disappeared behind a </p><p>scurrying woolly cloud. Five thousand, </p><p>five hundred feet, the altimeter read, just </p><p>as his commander had said. </p><p> One of the flyers lounging at the hangar</p><p>door nodded with appreciation. </p><p> “Nice clean climb,” he remarked</p><p>casually. </p><p> “You said,” agreed another. “ ’S more</p><p>than the Hun can do as yet—well, hope he </p><p>gets back.” </p><p> “Uh-huh.”</p><p> And the group turned into the hangar</p><p>again. The assenting grunt was the only </p><p>indication which these quiet men vouch- </p><p>safed that their comrade had gone to play </p><p>with death on even chances. </p><p> Mackensie did get back. Within the</p><p>hour he suddenly shot through a white </p><p>cloud like a falling meteorite. Nose-down </p><p>he swooped, almost vertically, never flat- </p><p>tening till within a hundred feet of the </p><p>ground. Then he glided into the hori- </p><p>zontal and a minute later he skimmed the </p><p>grass with a precision which rolled his </p><p>machine to the very doors of the hangar. </p><p>The wings and fuselage were spotted with </p><p>neat little round holes, almost a hundred </p><p>of them. Mackensie climbed out of his </p><p>perch and pushed the goggles up into his </p><p>hair. </p><p> “Couldn't get a darn thing,” he growled.</p><p>“The air is just buzzing with hostiles and </p><p>they kept me above the cloud-level all the </p><p>time. Dived into a hole once and got a </p><p>glimpse of a million anti-air guns and then </p><p>a swarm of them chased me.” </p><p> He strode into the quarters to make out</p><p>his official report. </p><p> It was a cryptic document which he</p><p>evolved. Below the entries of air con- </p><p>ditions and time of departure and return </p><p>came the following riddle: </p><p> Made enemy’s lines at six thousand. Imme-</p><p>diately H. A. appeared under my tail, firing. </p><p>Side-looped and got broadside position, got in fifty </p><p>rounds Lewis at a hundred. H. A. went down in </p><p>spin. I was following, when attacked by another </p><p>H.	A. on my tail. Went off on the wing and</p><p>climbed. Got on his tail, got in good burst of a </p><p>hundred rounds. H. A. looped reverse. Two </p><p>more H. A.’s below me. CUmbed to fourteen </p><p>thousand before got clear. </p><p> There was more to the same effect; a</p><p>whole sheet of technical enigma, grimly </p><p>redolent of battle and murder and sudden </p><p>death. Interpreted briefly it meant that</p><p>he had been attacked by an H. A., which </p><p>meant hostile aeroplane, had escaped by </p><p>clever maneuvering, had attacked in turn, </p><p>been attacked again, had taken his turn </p><p>once more, till finally ever-increasing num- </p><p>bers had driven him off. The condition of </p><p>his machine showed how fierce had been </p><p>the fighting. </p><p> Captain Reynolds skimmed through the</p><p>report with a practised eye. </p><p> “Em. Couldn’t get any of them?”</p><p> “No luck at all. I don’t know about</p><p>the first; but they were too many for me.” </p><p> Captain Reynolds frowned.</p><p> “ ’S too bad. I never saw such a rotten</p><p>run of luck as yours. Well, I’ll report to </p><p>the general. Maybe he’ll want the whole </p><p>darn squadron out, though we can’t do </p><p>much with these clouds so low.” </p><p> But the general saw reason. He realized</p><p>the impossibility of getting under the cloud- </p><p>level in the face of the enemy’s flyers, to </p><p>say nothing of the anti-aircraft guns which </p><p>The Honor of the Escadrille </p><p>157 </p><p>were dangerous up to ten thousand feet. </p><p>The attempt had to be postponed, then, to </p><p>wait for more propitious air conditions. </p><p>The general chafed, for the enemy truly </p><p>showed a diabolical knowledge of his plans. </p><p>MEANWHILE Mackensie, after </p><p>his short hour of duty—which, how- </p><p>ever, involved more nerve-strain </p><p>than a whole day in the trenches—was </p><p>sprucing up for a holiday. He had washed </p><p>voluminously, shaved carefully, and was </p><p>now attending with methodical exactness </p><p>to the final details of his well-kept nails. </p><p>One of his reckless fellows on whose hands </p><p>time hung heavy pounced on him. </p><p> “My, my, look at Mac all camouflaged</p><p>up like he was going to a wedding! Where </p><p>away, Mac?” </p><p> Mackensie dodged the issue.</p><p> “Engine throws oil something fierce. I</p><p>must get my mechanicians after it.” </p><p> “Doubtless, old acrobat, satis doubt; il</p><p>faut qu’on jump upon the cochons avec both </p><p>feet. But that don’t say what all the </p><p>disguise is for.” </p><p> “Well, if you must know, since I’ve done</p><p>a day’s job I’m going out to relax and jeer </p><p>at you poor ticks who have to stick around.” </p><p>“Hear him, fellers. Listen to the leisured </p><p>patrician. But again I demand, where? </p><p>Where d’you find all this amusement in </p><p>this so lugubrious vale of tears?” </p><p>Mackensie suddenly grinned at him. </p><p>“Hospital,” he said laconically. </p><p> There was a shout from the rest.</p><p> “Ha! Ha!” “Wily fellow!” “Leave it to a</p><p>canny Scot all the time. Which one is it, </p><p>Mac? I’ll bet it’s that tall blonde.” </p><p> “No it isn’t,” shouted another. “I know.</p><p>It’s Miss Levasseur. Mac’s trying to cut </p><p>in on Watso here.” </p><p> The young flyer mentioned flushed</p><p>angrily at the suggestion. </p><p> Mackensie smiled on them easily.</p><p>“Wrong again; I’m going on a matter of </p><p>business.” </p><p> The crowd greeted this preposterous</p><p>subterfuge with prolonged howls, and only </p><p>ceased from their exuberant derision when </p><p>Captain Reynolds came in and held his </p><p>hands over his ears. He took a seat on an </p><p>upturned uniform-case, and it was evident </p><p>that there was something on his mind. </p><p> “Boys,” he began slowly, “we’ve got to</p><p>do something.” </p><p> “Sure, Cap’n, let’s,” came unanimously</p><p>from the crowd. “What shall we do?” </p><p>“No, this is serious, boys. It concerns </p><p>us as a bunch. The old general is a white </p><p>man from way back and he’s not saying </p><p>anything; but it’s a fact that he’s worried </p><p>about the Huns getting all the information </p><p>they want. Now it’s up to us, boys; I feel </p><p>that the honor of the outfit is at stake.” </p><p> His hearers stirred uneasily at this</p><p>imputation, slight though its was, that they </p><p>had fallen short in what was expected of </p><p>them. </p><p> “Gee whiz, Cap’n. I hope the general</p><p>don’t think that way. That’s pretty </p><p>strong. But I don’t see how anybody can </p><p>blame us. I’ll bet we’re keeping our air </p><p>as clear of observers as they’re keeping </p><p>theirs.” </p><p> The captain gave a quick sop to their</p><p>pride. </p><p> “Of course, they’ve put their best men</p><p>against us here. I suppose that’s a com- </p><p>pliment to us, but-” </p><p> “Well, we’re holding them even at that,”</p><p>a stocky youth broke in hotly. “Spite of </p><p>the fact that they’ve got more machines.” </p><p>“I should say. Why, that ground is just </p><p>sprouting hangars and A. A. guns; there’s </p><p>five big shacks and two more going up. </p><p>But at that, as Billy says, we hold them </p><p>even every time. No sir, if they’re getting </p><p>information about the general’s works it’s </p><p>not from their sky-observations; it’ll be </p><p>their intelligence system; spy stuff, that’s </p><p>what.” </p><p> The captain nodded, but without en-</p><p>thusiasm. </p><p> “You’re right, boys, I know. But it’s</p><p>results that the general looks at; we’ve just </p><p>got to do something to put a crimp in their </p><p>gang. We’ve got the reputation of all </p><p>Uncle Sam’s flyers to keep up, and, by </p><p>cripes, we’re not going to fall down on it.” </p><p>“Right, Cap’nl We will!” </p><p> These men were not given to wild bursts</p><p>of cheering or spasms of spectacular emo- </p><p>tion—a matter which always amazed their </p><p>French confreres. They had no emotions </p><p>as a matter of fact, and all their nervous </p><p>reactions were strictly under control; but </p><p>each man felt a glow of hard determination </p><p>at their captain’s quiet confidence. </p><p> “Well, I’m going to see if we can get any</p><p>photos tomorrow,” the captain resumed. </p><p>“I’ll have Decker go up with some of you; </p><p>he’s got all his apparatus ready. I’ll slate </p><p>you for first hop in the morning, Watson.” </p><p>158 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Watson looked up with a sudden frown</p><p>and he shifted uneasily on his seat. Pres- </p><p>ently he made bold to speak. His words </p><p>were nervously formal. </p><p> “If you don’t mind, sir, I’d rather take</p><p>up somebody else.” </p><p> The captain was surprised.</p><p> “Frankly, sir, I—I don’t like ‘Heinie’</p><p>Decker.” He laid emphasis on the name. </p><p>“Nothing against him personally, sir, noth- </p><p>ing at all; but—well, it’s his name, and— </p><p>he was bom on this side too. I suppose </p><p>it’s prejudice, but if it’s all the same to you </p><p>I’d rather take up somebody else, anybody </p><p>else.” </p><p> A series of nods and a grunt or two</p><p>signified that others of the men felt the </p><p>same way. </p><p> “Ah, what’s the matter with Heinie?”</p><p>broke in Mackensie. “He’s the best pho- </p><p>tographer in the outfit.” </p><p> “Maybe, but aerial photography is no</p><p>longer a matter of the individual observer, </p><p>it’s a matter of apparatus and the expert </p><p>in the developing-room.” </p><p> “Not entirely, Watso, my son, by no</p><p>means,” replied Mackensie. “It’s still </p><p>up to the observer to know just when to </p><p>pull his exposure lever; he’s got to judge </p><p>the best position and the best light. Give </p><p>Heinie to me, Captain; let me have him </p><p>for keeps, and I’ll bet we get more valuable </p><p>pictures than any of you fellows.” </p><p> Captain Reynolds looked relieved.</p><p> “Very well, if it’s so easily settled. I</p><p>know how some of us feel about the mis- </p><p>guided fanaticism of the German-born </p><p>mind. I’ll schedule some other man for </p><p>you, Watson. And results, boys. That’s </p><p>what we want from now on, results!” </p><p> The captain’s tone indicated that the</p><p>serious side of his business was accom- </p><p>plished. Mackensie heaved his lean length </p><p>from his seat. </p><p> “Well, if that’s settled, Captain, I’ve got</p><p>an important business engagement at the </p><p>hospital.” </p><p> Once again the howls of derision rose.</p><p>Mackensie turned in the doorway and </p><p>smiled slowly on his fellows with impassive </p><p>eyes, and then he disappeared. Watson </p><p>looked after him sourly. </p><p> “Huh, results,” he muttered, his mind</p><p>still half-engaged with the captain’s ex- </p><p>hortation. “If I’d been out on that last </p><p>observation I bet I’d have got at least one </p><p>Hun machine.” </p><p> “Hark at the boy!” laughed a man who</p><p> carried the coveted decoration of the legion</p><p> on his chest. “He’d have crashed a hostile.</p><p> Man, lemme tell you that Mac there is one</p><p> of the best flyers we have.”</p><p> “Well, you don’t notice that he rates any</p><p> stars, do you?”</p><p> The disgruntled youngster referred to</p><p> the tiny stars which some of the flyers with</p><p> a whimsical recollection of their own wild</p><p> and woolly West painted on their machines</p><p> to correspond to notches on a gun.</p><p> “Luck, pure luck, boy, and you know it.</p><p> Why, even Barker piloted a scout for two</p><p> years before he made a kill. Shake it off</p><p> kid; you’re just jealous because he’s gone</p><p> sparking your girl.”</p><p> The man of experience smote him on the</p><p> back with fatherly good fellowship. But</p><p> Watson was very young; and it was quite</p><p> true, he was jealous. He remained gloomily</p><p> morose.</p><p> HE HUNG about the quarters with</p><p> restless preoccupation; then he went</p><p> out to inspect his machine, but</p><p> before he got ’round even to the rear brace-</p><p> wires he gave it up and drifted back to the</p><p> quarters, a worried expression on his smooth</p><p> sensitive face. Finally he screwed up all</p><p> his courage and went to his commanding</p><p> , officer. Since there was apparently no</p><p> &gt;rospect of any serious work that afternoon,</p><p> le preambled, might not he take a couple of</p><p> lours off?</p><p> Captain Reynolds had to laugh out loud</p><p> at the transparency of the boy.</p><p> “Run along, Watson, run right along,”</p><p> he said. “I guess I’ll know where to find</p><p> you if you’re wanted.”</p><p> The captain’s guess did not require any</p><p> great perspicacity. Watson went, almost</p><p> at a run, straight to the hospital. For an</p><p> interminable ten minutes he was unable</p><p> to find his quest, and his face flushed</p><p> fiercely as he thought of some cozy hidden</p><p> nook. And then, all of a sudden, he came</p><p> upon her sitting innocently knitting with</p><p> two or three other nurses who were off</p><p> duty.</p><p> It was such an agreeable surprise that</p><p> it was quite a disagreeable shock to his</p><p> preconceived suspicion. He lost no time,</p><p> but with that swift American confidence,</p><p> which always bewildered the girl, he pro-</p><p> ceeded to cut her out from the bunch and</p><p> segregate her to himself- After the tide</p><p>The Honor of the Escadrille </p><p>159 </p><p> of the first voluble fifteen minutes had</p><p> abated somewhat his earlier jealous sus-</p><p> picion found time to insinuate itself once</p><p> more.</p><p> “You know,” he said half-apologetically.</p><p>“I thought Lieutenant Mackensie had come </p><p>to call on you.” </p><p> The girl’s pretty eyebrows lifted with her</p><p>shoulders in a gesture of surprised denial. </p><p> “On me? Mais quel blague! How you</p><p>are fooleesh. Non, he come to see ziz </p><p>Monsieur Dunois, zis capitaine of ze </p><p>ingenieurs.” </p><p> “Engineers! Then maybe it was busi-</p><p>ness. Well, I thought—some of the fellows </p><p>said he was coming to see you.” </p><p> The girl could not resist the instinct of</p><p>coquetry; particularly since she knew that </p><p>she pouted ravishingly. She executed the </p><p>maneuver now. </p><p> “Vraiment? But no, he does not interest</p><p>me. Howevaire, eef he would wear hees so </p><p>beautiful costume national it should be </p><p>different, ma foi, oui. II est Ecossais, n’est- </p><p>ce pas?" </p><p> Watson was not deceived for a moment;</p><p>he laughed. </p><p> “A Kiltie? Well, I don’t know. I sup-</p><p>pose so, but his accent, if he has any at </p><p>all, I should say would be more like a </p><p>German’s.” </p><p> “Ye-es? Well, I ’ave not ze so good</p><p>fortune zat he call on me; II est bel homme, </p><p>ce Monsieur Mackensie.” </p><p> She pronounced the name with the broad</p><p>French “A” and the accent on the last </p><p>syllable. </p><p> “Yeah, he is—” Watson who had begun</p><p>to admit grudgingly his supposed rival’s </p><p>physical perfections, stopped with a sudden </p><p>catch of the breath. </p><p> Something in the girl’s intonation had</p><p>struck a dormant chord in the back of his</p><p>brain and waked it to acute perception. </p><p>He knew instantly that it had been there </p><p>all along. </p><p> “Mackensen!” he burst out loud.</p><p> “W’at you say?”</p><p> “Oh, er—oh, nothing. I just had a</p><p>funny idea, that’s all.” </p><p> He laughed off his little effusion and</p><p>proceeded to make love to the girl with the </p><p>assiduous speed of the man who knows that </p><p>life is short. But he was not up to form; </p><p>he was preoccupied and his mind wandered. </p><p>Presently even the girl’s charm could not </p><p>wholly distract his thoughts from this new </p><p>thing which hammered at his brain with </p><p>ever-increasing insistence. He knew that </p><p>he was becoming dull, and with rare wisdom </p><p>he forged an excuse and took his departure </p><p>before he should appear stupid to the girl. </p><p> He made speed to get back to the quar-</p><p>ters; he could hardly contain himself. </p><p>He pounced on his friend Britten, a young </p><p>daredevil of his own age, and drew him </p><p>away from the crowd. </p><p> “Jim,” he burst out. “Did you ever</p><p>notice anything about Mac’s accent?” </p><p>“No,” said Jim. “Why? Hold on </p><p>though, I think I did, yes.” </p><p> “Well, did you ever think of his name?</p><p>No? Well, pronounce it the French way </p><p>and see. Now just shift the last two letters </p><p>a bit and take the accent out of the middle. </p><p>How’s that? Mackensen! Von Mack- </p><p>ensen! D’you get it?” </p><p> The other gasped.</p><p> “Aw, rats, Watso. That’s a crazy idea.”</p><p>“Is it though? Just think! Look at him. </p><p>He’s got that cold, deadly method in every- </p><p>thing he does, hasn’t he? And you saw </p><p>how he jumped for Heinie Decker this </p><p>morning. And—” Watson spoke with </p><p>slow emphasis—“they say he’s the best </p><p>flyer in the outfit, but you notice that he </p><p>never brings down a Hun machine.” </p><p> Britten laughed uneasily.</p><p> “Shucks, Watso. “You’re letting your</p><p>imagination run away with you. You’re </p><p>just jealous because he went after your </p><p>girl.” </p><p> “He didn’t though,” maintained Watson</p><p>with dark insistence. “And I’m not having </p><p>imaginative brainstorms either; you add </p><p>it all up and see how it hits you. And— </p><p>gee whiz! I never thought of that! Where </p><p>are the Heinies getting all their information </p><p>from?” </p><p> Britten laughed again, but there was un-</p><p>certainty in it this time. However, he </p><p>rejected the monstrous insinuation. </p><p> “Oh, come along, Watso,” he said.</p><p>“Your suspicion is unworthy. Forget it.” </p><p>“Maybe it is,” insisted the other de- </p><p>fiantly. “But I’m not going to sleep over </p><p>it; you can bet I’ll keep my eyes skinned.” </p><p>Britten argued with him, but feebly, and </p><p>finally he, too, agreed that possibly, after </p><p>all, there might be—well, it would do no </p><p>harm to watch anyhow. </p><p> The watching during the next few critical</p><p>days revealed nothing. The lean, in- </p><p>scrutable flyer with the doubtful name </p><p>i6o </p><p>Adventure </p><p>and the observer whom he had so eagerly </p><p>chosen, about whose name there was no </p><p>doubt at all, made several flights together, </p><p>and presently the former was going about </p><p>the camp cheerfully joshing his fellows and </p><p>making invidious comparisons about their </p><p>respective photographic observations and </p><p>trying to lay bets that he and his team- </p><p>mate would continue to surpasss the efforts </p><p>of the others. Some of the foolhardy </p><p>betted—and they lost, always. </p><p> Britten called the attention of his sus-</p><p>picious friend to the fact. But Watson </p><p>only shook his head with dogged insistence. </p><p> “Shucks, what’s a few photographs of</p><p>unimportant terrain? That don’t mean </p><p>anything, even if they are technically </p><p>perfect. And I’ll tell you what. I’ll swear </p><p>my soul that I heard them talking German </p><p>together. You just lay low and watch </p><p>out.” </p><p> Then the Mackensie man was noticed</p><p>to be holding long, guarded councils with </p><p>his friend, the upshot of which was that he </p><p>shook his head and muttered regretfully— </p><p>“They’ll never give us a chance to do it </p><p>in a million years.” </p><p> “On our own hook then,” growled</p><p>Decker with sturdy determination. “In </p><p>the air we make the change.” </p><p> “Gosh! Can we?”</p><p> “Sure,” muttered Heinie. “You just</p><p>fly her. Mine is the rest; so, I tell you.” </p><p>FOLLOWED more quiet con- </p><p>ferences, and the next thing, the </p><p>two had taken a big Morane biplane, </p><p>and while mechanics overhauled the engine, </p><p>they personally proceeded to connect up </p><p>an intricate maze of control-wires, and </p><p>finally they mounted a stubby black steel </p><p>cigar with a small propeller at the front end </p><p>on the top of the upper plane. Watson </p><p>just had to go and look into the matter. </p><p> “What’s the stream-like thing on the</p><p>roof?” he asked casually. </p><p> Mackensie shot a quick glance at him</p><p>from under his straight brows. </p><p> “Servo-motor,” he said shortly. “Works</p><p>by wind pressure.” </p><p> “Servo? What for?”</p><p> “For a Sperry gyro-stabilizer.”</p><p> “An automatic stabilizer? Cripes, you</p><p>can’t fly with them!” </p><p> “Can’t you!” Mackensie took up his</p><p>challenge. “Son, it’s already two years </p><p>ago since Laurence Sperry went up five </p><p>thousand feet and then climbed out of his </p><p>seat and walked out to the end of his </p><p>wing!” </p><p> “Yes, I know. But what I mean is, since</p><p>every dip and roll is immediately corrected </p><p>by the gyroscopic control you can’t do any </p><p>quick maneuvering.” </p><p> “Do tell.” Mackensie was exasperatingly</p><p>sarcastic. </p><p> But Watson was not to be diverted by</p><p>any such transparent subterfuge as a forced </p><p>quarrel. </p><p> “What’s it for?” he asked bluntly.</p><p> Mackensie stood up and looked keenly</p><p>at him. Decker from behind his back </p><p>made some quick signals and mouthed </p><p>something with silent distinctness. Mac- </p><p>kensie took it all in without shifting his </p><p>gaze from Watson’s face, and then he </p><p>smiled his thin silent smile. </p><p> “It’s for special photographic work,”</p><p>he said evenly; and then he added a dis- </p><p>arming postscript. “For details apply to </p><p>Captain Reynolds.” </p><p> For a moment Watson was staggered;</p><p>and then it occurred to him instantly that </p><p>two such clever spies would surely have </p><p>found no difficulty in inventing some </p><p>plausible story which would gain them </p><p>permission to experiment with the new </p><p>machine. He called them spies openly </p><p>in his own mind now, and half he was </p><p>impelled to go to his superior officer with </p><p>his suspicions.</p><p> But he had not quite enough evidence</p><p>yet, he reflected. Give them a little more </p><p>time and they would presently weave a </p><p>rope long enough to hang themselves with, </p><p>he said to himself. So he pretended a </p><p>casual interest and presently got away to </p><p>consult with his friend Britten. </p><p> Mackensie looked after him with</p><p>narrowed eyes. </p><p> “That young fool is going to give us</p><p>trouble, Heinie,” he muttered. </p><p> “Too slow,” said Heinie phlegmatically.</p><p>“Already this afternoon we can do it; look </p><p>at the clouds.” </p><p> Mackensie nodded. The cloud forma-</p><p>tion was a low cumulo-nimbus, heavy and </p><p>dark. Behind them lay shelter and con- </p><p>cealment. But the flyer’s forehead puckered. </p><p> “It’s a frightful chance, Heinie,” he</p><p>murmured soberly. “Their own guns’ll </p><p>probably drop us long before we can land </p><p>in their lines with my precious little </p><p>packages.” </p><p>The Honor of the Escadrille </p><p>161 </p><p> “Neffer,” maintained Heinie stoutly,</p><p>“when we do as I have suggested-” </p><p> “And that’s a frightful chance too, my</p><p>friend. That’s going to be an awful stunt </p><p>to pull off.” </p><p> Decker’s pale eyes gleamed with fanatical</p><p>fire. </p><p> “For the sake of the cause which we do,”</p><p>he growled fiercely, “I take twice such a </p><p>chance.” </p><p> After the noon hour that same day</p><p>Watson saw Decker carrying out his </p><p>intricate camera and attaching it with </p><p>long bolts to the side of the fuselage just </p><p>below and a little to the rear of the ob- </p><p>server’s seat. He wondered for a moment </p><p>whether, after all, the photographic story </p><p>might not be true; and then he laughed </p><p>at his own simplicity and told himself, no, </p><p>they would never overlook such an obvious </p><p>give-away. He would just keep watching, </p><p>he determined, and sooner or later some- </p><p>thing would fall to his vigilance. </p><p> But “too slow” had been Decker’s terse</p><p>estimate of him. He had failed to take into </p><p>consideration the swift efficiency with </p><p>which these two men did their work. It </p><p>was not till everything w^s ready for the </p><p>start that by a sheer stroke of luck he saw </p><p>Mackensie furtively hand a few packages </p><p>up to Decker already in the observer’s </p><p>seat, neat fat packages of oiled paper about </p><p>ten inches long. </p><p> Suddenly it came to him that it was now!</p><p>That whatever these two contemplated </p><p>was going to be done right away. </p><p> “Maps,” he gasped to himself. “Docu-</p><p>ments!” </p><p> He rushed across the field toward the</p><p>machine shouting and waving his arms </p><p>wildly. </p><p> “Spin her over!” roared Mackensie to the</p><p>mechanic at the propeller. “It’s on!” </p><p> “On!” shouted the mechanic and spun.</p><p> Watson’s heart came up into his mouth</p><p>as the engine took up at the first attempt. </p><p>But this machine was heavier than the </p><p>usual fast scout which Mackensie drove; </p><p>the mechanicians had to hold it for a few </p><p>seconds till the engine picked up its full </p><p>speed. Watson came racing, clawing along </p><p>the tail of the fuselage. </p><p> “What have you got in those packages?”</p><p>he yelled. </p><p> Mackensie looked down on him and</p><p>grinned with malicious triumph. </p><p> “Ask Captain Dunois over at the hos-</p><p>u </p><p> pital,” he shouted above the roar of the</p><p> engine. “Let her go, there!”</p><p> The great machine sprang forward and</p><p> skimmed the grass. Watson was left</p><p> shrieking and running wildly after it.</p><p> But only for a second. Swift presence of</p><p> mind is one of the first requirements of a</p><p> fighting pilot, and Uncle Sam’s boys have</p><p> always passed through more severe tests</p><p> than any of the allied flyers. In another</p><p> second Watson was racing for his own fast</p><p> scout which bore the deadly Vickers gun</p><p> pointing grimly over its nose.</p><p> As Mackensie circled to the higher levels</p><p> he saw him climbing in while there was a</p><p> rush of mechanicians to the propeller. His</p><p> face grew hard with annoyance.</p><p> “-young fool! He’ll be shooting at</p><p> us next,” he growled. Then with a shrug</p><p> of unconcern: “Well, I’ll hide in the cloud-</p><p> bank. And if he can follow me there he’ll</p><p> be some flyer.”</p><p> He certainly would. Flying through the</p><p> clouds is one of the deadliest trials which</p><p> • an aviator has to face; infinitely worse than</p><p> flying by night. But Mackensie set his</p><p> planes in a long slant for the dark bank.</p><p> Just before he cleaved into it he looked</p><p> down away to his left once more. Watson’s</p><p> machine was just rising from the ground.</p><p> Mackensie smiled his thin smile. In an-</p><p> other second he was enveloped in heavy</p><p> swirling vapor which muffled even the roar</p><p> of the engine. He brought his machine</p><p> to the horizontal and settled down with</p><p> alert determination to a long drawn-out</p><p> game of moist blind man’s buff.</p><p> Presently Decker stood up in the front</p><p> seat and turned ’round and waved his hands</p><p> in some sort of signal. Then with cool</p><p> daring he climbed out and stepped on to</p><p> the footway of the lower plane as non-</p><p> chalantly as though he had been going</p><p> about some small job with the machine</p><p> safe and solid in the hangar instead of five</p><p> thousand feet up in the wet, clammy air.</p><p> He cupped his hands and roared into</p><p> Mackensie’s ear.</p><p> “Just I have thought. What if they</p><p> notice the paint is wet?”</p><p> Mackensie thought for a second, then:</p><p> “They won’t. Nobody’s likely to stoop</p><p> and look under the plane when we’re once</p><p> on the ground.”</p><p> Decker nodded.</p><p> “Yeah, that’s right too. Well, I go</p><p> ahead with the job.”</p><p>Adventure </p><p>AND with no more fuss than that </p><p>he proceeded with his usual slow </p><p>deliberation to do an unbelievable </p><p>thing. He dived an arm into the recesses </p><p>of the front seat and produced a tangle of </p><p>cords and snap-hooks. Then he made a </p><p>sign to Mackensie and moved out on the </p><p>wing surface, careful to rest his weight only </p><p>on the longitudinal “I” beam and clinging </p><p>to the brace-wires to keep from being </p><p>whirled from his unstable perch by the </p><p>hundred-mile wind which tore at his </p><p>clothes. </p><p> Mackensie watched his balance very</p><p>carefully and marveled for the thousandth </p><p>time at the superhuman sensitiveness of the </p><p>little whizzing gyroscope which detected </p><p>every shade of divergence from the plane </p><p>of flight. As he found how it automatically </p><p>checked up against the increasing leverage </p><p>of Decker’s weight as he made his way out </p><p>on to the wing he pictured it as a live thing </p><p>with an alert uncanny intelligence of its </p><p>own and he thanked its inventor aloud. </p><p> But Decker was troubled with no flights</p><p>of meditative fancy; with unimaginative </p><p>stolidity he wound his legs ’round the </p><p>forward center strut and lowered himself </p><p>to a sitting posture. He unraveled his </p><p>tangle of rope which resolved itself into a </p><p>crude sort of hammock arrangement. With </p><p>methodical exactitude he snapped one of </p><p>the hooks over the base of the strut. Then, </p><p>lying on his stomach and leaning far over </p><p>the hurtling abyss, he groped with his arm </p><p>and presently the other hook snapped com- </p><p>fortingly into an eyebolt. </p><p> Then he straightened himself out again</p><p>with slow caution and returned as carefully </p><p>as he had come. From the wonder cabinet </p><p>of the front seat he now lifted, of all un- </p><p>likely things, a couple of pots of paint and </p><p>a brush. He leaned over to Mackensie and </p><p>held up the spread fingers of one hand three </p><p>times. </p><p> “Fifteen minutes,” he shouted. “ ’S all</p><p>I need.” </p><p> He fought his way out again and lowered</p><p>himself as before. The pots of paint were </p><p>disposed of over the edge of the wing, evi- </p><p>dently on to hooks below; and then with </p><p>a cheerful wave of the hand the crazy</p><p>fanatic slid over into his swaying, straining </p><p>net. </p><p> Mackensie flew on with a tense face</p><p>through the clinging mist and began to </p><p>wonder. He wondered if he would feel a </p><p>lurch if his partner in this wild venture </p><p>should be shaken out of his awful perch. </p><p>But no lurch came. Decker, working with </p><p>iron nerve and sure swiftness painted out </p><p>the target-circles with which the Allies </p><p>distinguish their machines and painted in </p><p>the great black cross of the Germans. </p><p> There was no hitch, no accident; every-</p><p>thing had been thought out and prepared </p><p>in advance. In less than the fifteen </p><p>minutes which he had demanded his round </p><p>face appeared over the edge of the wing </p><p>and he wormed his body up after it like a </p><p>stocky eel. He collected his paraphernalia </p><p>and returned as before. Mackensie </p><p>snatched a hand from the steering-wheel </p><p>and slapped him on the back. Decker </p><p>grinned back at him and proceeded to </p><p>climb over to the other side. Mackensie </p><p>flew like a Japanese ladder balancer who </p><p>supports a bamboo ladder on his feet while </p><p>a slim youth in tights climbs about on it </p><p>and does hair-raising stunts. </p><p> In fifteen more minutes Decker crawled</p><p>out from under the other wing. He was </p><p>grinning all over like a boy who has been </p><p>up to mischief; but his face grew fierce as </p><p>he stooped over Mackensie. </p><p> “Goot. It is finished,” he shouted.</p><p>“Now it is in your hands, the great plan. </p><p>Forwards, and goot luck!” </p><p> Mackensie gripped his hand once, and</p><p>then he drove his machine in a long glide </p><p>through the cloud-belt to get his bearings. </p><p>They were far to the south and well over the </p><p>enemy’s lines. Mackensie nodded with </p><p>satisfaction and climbed again. He pro- </p><p>posed to travel through the clear upper </p><p>strata till he should come again to the </p><p>Hautebois section. </p><p> After hurtling for half an hour through</p><p>the emptiness—for there could be no air- </p><p>scouting on a day like that—he began to </p><p>recognize familiar ground through an occa- </p><p>sional break in the billowing blanket below </p><p>him. Then, far away above him his sharp</p><p>eyes discerned a tiny mosquito of a machine </p><p>which immediately dropped down on him </p><p>like a stone. He grinned with appreciation. </p><p> “That’ll be friend Watso,” he chuckled,</p><p>and he dived into the cloud again. </p><p> Ten minutes later his machine came to a</p><p>stop behind the neat hangars and the </p><p>bristling hedge of anti-aircraft guns which </p><p>he had seen so often from above. Soldiers </p><p>in flat, peakless caps began to run toward </p><p>them. Mackensie hopped out and went </p><p>% </p><p>The Honor of the Escadrille </p><p>163 </p><p>to meet them. He ignored the soldiers </p><p>just as though they were cattle. They were </p><p>used to this: they streamed on past him. </p><p>Before a slender young man who was ob- </p><p>viously of another breed Mackensie halted, </p><p>clicked his heels together and saluted </p><p>affectedly. </p><p> “Geslatlen Sie,” he addressed him in clean,</p><p>incisive Hanoverian German. “I am </p><p>Leutnant von Mackensen from the Vielle- </p><p>gard section; I am out of gasoline. If I </p><p>might beg.” </p><p> “Aber naturlich, Herr Leutnant,” said the</p><p>youthful officer without hesitation. </p><p> All muffled up as Mackensie was in</p><p>leather coat and goggles and helmet, there </p><p>was no discrepancy of uniform for the other </p><p>to be suspicious about. Mackensie’s heart </p><p>which had been pounding against his chest </p><p>before the encounter began to return to </p><p>the normal and he heard the officer speak </p><p>again. </p><p> “Your mechanician will attend to the</p><p>matter. Permit that I escort you %&gt; the </p><p>quarters and offer you some refreshment.” </p><p> “I thank you, no,” said Mackensie</p><p>hurriedly. “I have not the time to spare; </p><p>already I should be back, Excellenz reviews </p><p>today personally.” </p><p> But he showed no immediate disposition</p><p>to go. Instead, he stood engaging the </p><p>young man in conversation while he saw </p><p>Decker alight and establish friendly rela- </p><p>tions with the soldiers. Decker could do </p><p>with refreshment if there was any to be </p><p>had, he proclaimed thirstily; and the </p><p>soldiers grinned and winked and led him </p><p>into the hangars. Mackensie conversed </p><p>with the young officer. He knew from his </p><p>accent that he was a Berliner, and to avoid </p><p>any awkward questions about the opera- </p><p>tions further down the line he immediately </p><p>lied glibly, inventing a fascinating story of </p><p>having just come back from leave in his </p><p>home town of Hanover. </p><p> The officer was immediately interested,</p><p>and Mackensie wondered wildly what he </p><p>could answer to the eager questions about</p><p>Cafe Kropke and Weltman’s. For half an </p><p>hour he fenced with him, and then, seeing </p><p>Decker in ostentatious evidence beside the </p><p>machine, he remembered affrightedly the </p><p>haste which was incumbent on him. With </p><p>the deepest reluctance he tore himself from </p><p>such pleasant company. </p><p> As he climbed into his seat he whispered</p><p>to Decker— </p><p> “Plant all the packages?”</p><p> Decker nodded.</p><p> “Camera ready?”</p><p> “Sure, everything. Hurry.”</p><p> “Parat?” called Mackensie to the German</p><p>hangar crews. “Also—losl” </p><p> The engine took up Deautifully, and in</p><p>another minute the machine was soaring </p><p>over the hangars in a wide circle. </p><p> AT THE same instant aviator</p><p>fjjflil Watson was pouring his excited </p><p>story into Captain Reynolds’ ears, </p><p>a story of rage and indignation and loath- </p><p>ing; and he clinched his testimony by </p><p>asserting, almost weeping with the beastli- </p><p>ness of it, that he had finally seen Mac- </p><p>kensie’s machine dive down through the </p><p>clouds into the German lines. </p><p> Captain Reynolds was deadly serious.</p><p>“It’s almost inconceivable, what you say, </p><p>Watson,” he kept repeating with undis- </p><p>guised grief. “But if you’re so sure, and </p><p>since Britten bears you out, I suppose </p><p>I must take the matter to the general right </p><p>away. -! What a beastly mess! </p><p>Better both come with me, I think.” </p><p>Twenty-five minutes later Mackensie was </p><p>dropping like a plummet into his own lines. </p><p>For the first time since anybody had known </p><p>him he seemed to have lost some of his </p><p>phlegmatic calm. He rushed Decker to </p><p>the laboratory. </p><p> “Develop out quicker’n all Hades while</p><p>I hunt up the chief,” he barked at him, </p><p>and raced for Captain Reynolds’ office. </p><p> Ten minutes later again he was snatching</p><p>a series of three wet prints out of Decker’s </p><p>hands and sprinting for the general’s head- </p><p>quarters. </p><p> When the general heard his name he</p><p>looked inquiringly at the three American </p><p>officers, who in turn looked amazedly at </p><p>one another. </p><p> “Qu’on Vadmette, immediatement,” he</p><p>ordered sharply. </p><p> Mackensie stalked in and saluted. The</p><p>general was brusk. </p><p> “Well sir?”</p><p>“I have just obtained some photographs </p><p>which may be of immediate importance. </p><p>First, this one, from three thousand feet.” </p><p>The general took it. His tone was terse. </p><p>“This represents the enemy’s hangars. </p><p>I have seen it before, it is nothing new.” </p><p>Mackensie handed him another. </p><p> “The same scene, sir, two minutes later.”</p><p>164 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> The general looked at it; and looked at</p><p>it again. And the more he looked, the </p><p>more puzzled he grew. Two of the hangars </p><p>were still in plain view; the other three </p><p>were obscured in the print by white </p><p>smudges, smoky-looking smudges, with </p><p>jagged specks apparently bursting from </p><p>them! Mackensie chose the dramatic mo- </p><p>ment for handing in the third. </p><p> “The same scene again, sir, five minutes</p><p>later on the return circle.” </p><p> The general gasped. Where the five</p><p>sheds had been was a chaos of twisted steel </p><p>and tumbled sticks from which rose thin </p><p>wisps of smoke. That was all that was </p><p>apparent to the naked eye; magnification </p><p>later would develop details, but it was </p><p>sufficient. The general gasped some more. </p><p>Then with quick French intuition he </p><p>realized the awkward situation which this </p><p>amazing young man’s unexpected entrance </p><p>had created. He was a man of infinite tact; </p><p>this was a matter for home settlement. </p><p>He turned to Captain Reynolds. </p><p> “Permit me, monsieur,” he said with</p><p>formal courtesy, “in the name of the French </p><p>nation to acknowledge yet once again an </p><p>unpayable debt to the Escadrille Ameri- </p><p>caine. I will request of you details— </p><p>later.” </p><p> The four men walked across the field</p><p>to their own hangars slowly. Nobody </p><p>spoke. Captain Reynolds did not know </p><p>how to handle the wretched situation. </p><p>They were half-way across before Watson </p><p>broke the uncomfortable silence with a </p><p>clean, manly confession. </p><p> “I—I've got to apologize to you, Mac,”</p><p>he said—he had the courage to refrain </p><p>from falling into the formal Mr. Mackensie, </p><p>“I’ve been thinking some mighty mean </p><p>things about you.” </p><p> “I know it, son,” said Mackensie cheer-</p><p>fully. “Captain Dunois who helped me </p><p>with my bombs learned from Miss Levas- </p><p>seur that you’d got on to the name.” </p><p> “The name! Then it is—well you see,</p><p>then, I thought you were a—I thought you</p><p>weren’t an American.” </p><p> Watson spoke with relief; there was some</p><p>mitigation for his suspicions. </p><p> Mackensie took up the inferred question</p><p>slowly and rather wistfully. </p><p> “Well now, that depends on what you</p><p>fellows consider an American. You see, </p><p>my old dad went across before I was born. </p><p>He quit the old country because he didn’t </p><p>like the Verboten stuff and the class dis- </p><p>tinctions, and he didn’t like to be governed </p><p>by the police bureau ’round the comer; he </p><p>wanted to have a say in the affairs of his </p><p>country. Of course, he got into trouble for </p><p>majeslatsbeleidigung, tese-majeste, you know; </p><p>so he beat it over to where free speech was </p><p>not a crime, and presently he switched the </p><p>name around a bit and took out his papers. </p><p> “Me, I was born in God’s country and</p><p>raised in it too; but I went to college in </p><p>Hanover, and I quit it for the same reasons </p><p>as my dad and for a whole lot more; and </p><p>I’ve always kinder regarded myself as </p><p>an-” </p><p> “An American, by-! That’s what</p><p>you are!” Britten burst out almost as a </p><p>challenge. </p><p> And the others grunted—</p><p> “You bet!”</p><p> “Thanks,” said Mackensie quietly. “It</p><p>does me good to hear you fellows say that.” </p><p>“Well, I’m sorry, Mac,” Watson apolo- </p><p>gized again. “I feel like a dog.” </p><p> “Ah, don’t worry, son, I don’t blame</p><p>you,” Mackensie laughed. “I know darn </p><p>well we were acting suspicious. We had </p><p>to, ’cause we’d never have got permission </p><p>to try the stunt—” he glanced whimsically </p><p>at his superior officer—“and so I’m down </p><p>on the captain’s books for a bawl out.” </p><p>“What I don’t understand,” said the </p><p>captain quite irrelevantly and ignoring the </p><p>last remark entirely, “is Heinie Decker.” </p><p>“Oh, Heinie,” chuckled Mackensie, </p><p>“Heinie’s a fanatic, he’s a Berserk, a Mad </p><p>Mullah. He was born in Alsace!” </p><p> They walked on in silence again. Their</p><p>hearts were all a little too full for un- </p><p>restrained speech. It was Watson with his </p><p>boyish irrepressibility who broke the tension </p><p>again. </p><p> “We-el,” he said slowly. “I guess there’s</p><p>about thirty cunnin’ li’l stars coming to your </p><p>machine, Mac.” </p><p>. Authors of "The Red Witch,” "The Pass of Blood,” etc. </p><p>\ND in proof of our loyalty to </p><p>his Majesty, I offer, in the name </p><p>of the town of Kinlochan, one </p><p>hundred silver pennies to any </p><p>citizen who brings in the head of Evan the </p><p>Outlaw. The king’s justiciar will bear me </p><p>witness that I have refuted the lying malice </p><p>of those who have accused us of giving aid </p><p>and comfort to the pretender, Robert of </p><p>Albany, and his bloodthirsty accomplice, </p><p>Evan. God save his Gracious Majesty, </p><p>Malcolm, King of Scotland!” </p><p> Duncan Mclvor, rigid as a statue in his</p><p>polished mail, scrutinized the speaker with </p><p>shrewd blue eyes. </p><p> “There is no falsehood in this man,</p><p>however many traitors there be in the </p><p>town,” he decided, and turned his sus- </p><p>picious gaze on the crowd that packed the </p><p>cathedral square to the very steps, where </p><p>they were held back by the spears of </p><p>Mclvor’s company of men-at-arms. With </p><p>loud shouting, with waving kerchiefs, the </p><p>townsfolk applauded their old provost’s </p><p>speech. Loyal? Show them the man who </p><p>said they were not! </p><p> From them, the young captain’s glance</p><p>shifted to the balconies of the houses </p><p>clustering about three sides of the square, </p><p>the fourth side of which was formed by </p><p>St. Andrew’s Cathedral. A few casements </p><p>were shut; the rest were streaming with </p><p>brightly colored banners and crowded with </p><p>the heads of women and children. Gay </p><p>and innocent enough it seemed, this sus- </p><p>pected city; but Duncan Mclvor had seen </p><p>treason and murder let loose in peaceful </p><p>cities before, and he trusted little to their </p><p>outward show. </p><p> He remembered the bloody massacre</p><p>of 1243, only two years before, when this </p><p>very Evan the Outlaw had ridden with two </p><p>hundred lances into Ardross, caught the </p><p>regent’s troops napping, and cut them to </p><p>pieces. In that terrible night every soldier </p><p>had been butchered, the regent himself </p><p>escaping only by the grace of God and a </p><p>swift horse. And the townsmen of Ardross </p><p>had unbarred the gates to the murderers. </p><p> The applause burst forth again, rever-</p><p>berating deafeningly from the high walls</p><p>of the houses. Still rigid in his saddle, </p><p>Duncan shifted his eyes from the crowd </p><p>to the cathedral portal. A tall, spare man </p><p>in a stained surcoat of soft leather appeared </p><p>beside Cospatrick, the provost, and ac- </p><p>knowledged the citizens’ welcome. This </p><p>was Sir Hugh Kennedy, Earl of Carfrae, </p><p>the king’s justiciar. A terrible man was </p><p>he, feared throughout Scotland for his </p><p>grim gray sword and his fierce gray eye; </p><p>his visit usually boded little good to the </p><p>city he honored with his presence. </p><p> Nor was Kinlochan the most conscience-</p><p>free city in the land, either; when the old </p><p>king died, its people had fought hard in </p><p>the cause of Robert, his illegitimate son, </p><p>and had been turned to loyalty only by </p><p>the efforts of Ronald Cospatrick. All that </p><p>was forgiven; but Evan the Headless, the </p><p>165 </p><p>Bishop </p><p>&amp;. Arthur GilchristBrodeur </p><p>Adventure </p><p>blood-guilty outlaw, had not been forgiven, </p><p>and Kinlochan’s most respectable citizens </p><p>were suspected of taking his pay. Certain </p><p>it was that the young bloods had been </p><p>known to toast Evan openly; and goods </p><p>pillaged from the veiy outskirts of the </p><p>capital had a way of showing up in Kin- </p><p>lochan. The townsfolk smelled blood in </p><p>the air; wherefore they applauded the </p><p>king’s justiciar with all their might. </p><p> Duncan’s heart swelled with pride in</p><p>his stem old leader. There he stood facing </p><p>hundreds of men who might be thirsting </p><p>for his blood; yet he appeared among them </p><p>unarmed and unarmored, fearless as was </p><p>his wont. His hawk’s eyes scanning them, </p><p>the old earl stepped forward, smiling lib </p><p>tight-lipped smile, acknowledging their </p><p>boisterous applause, and opened his mouth </p><p>to speak. Then, before he could utter a </p><p>word, Sir Hugh staggered, flung out both </p><p>arms, and dropped dead at the provost’s </p><p>feet. </p><p> Horrified, the crowd stood stunned and</p><p>silent, so that Duncan’s cry burst on his </p><p>own ears with a shock of terror. And well </p><p>might he be terrified; well might the </p><p>people stand rigid with horror; for, though </p><p>not a hand in the crowd had been raised, </p><p>though no one had stood near enough to </p><p>strike at Sir Hugh, the hilt of a dagger </p><p>now protruded from the dead man’s breast! </p><p> Instantly Duncan’s eye swept every</p><p>window facing on the square. If that </p><p>dagger had been thrown from the pave- </p><p>ment, he, sitting his horse a spear-length </p><p>before the crowd, would have seen the </p><p>hand that impelled it, would have seen </p><p>its flash; but he had seen nothing. The </p><p>windows too seemed harmless as before; </p><p>excepting those that were safely barred, by </p><p>his own order, they were all too far away </p><p>for the dagger to have been thrown from </p><p>them by any mortal hand. </p><p> The people had found their voices now.</p><p>Some fell to their knees, calling on the </p><p>saints; some wailed aloud in terror; a </p><p>white-haired beggar in the blue gown of </p><p>his caste cried out that the devil had done </p><p>the deed to bring shame on the good town </p><p>of Kinlochan. With one accord, the crowd </p><p>seized on his words, and howled aloud: </p><p> “ ’Tis the devil’s work! ’Tis the devil has</p><p>done it!” </p><p> “Jamieson! Post twenty men at the city</p><p>gate! Let none pass till I give the word!” </p><p>Duncan commanded crisply. </p><p> Jamieson caught the look in Mclvor’s</p><p>eye, and obeyed at once. He was a dour, </p><p>rangy Borderer on a stolen horse; though </p><p>he had little liking for his young officer, </p><p>he understood the consequences of dis- </p><p>obedience at such a time. </p><p> “You, Kilbeggie,” Mclvor ordered, “take</p><p>two-score men and search every house </p><p>in the town. Arrest all who resist or can </p><p>not give a good account of themselves. </p><p>Henderson, mount a patrol, scour the </p><p>district, and look sharp for signs of Evan’s </p><p>men. Seize all who go armed. Steenson, </p><p>ride to the regent with the ill news and ask </p><p>for thirty spearmen.” </p><p> This done, Mclvor dismounted, passed</p><p>through the line of men-at-arms, strode </p><p>up the cathedral steps, and touched the </p><p>provost’s arm. </p><p> “It grieves me much to do this thing,</p><p>Donald Cospatrick,” he said gravely, “but </p><p>my duty requires me to place you under </p><p>arrest. Now that the earl is dead, I am </p><p>in authority here. If you will go with </p><p>my fellows to the keep, I will see to my </p><p>master.” </p><p>THE provost bowed, and a squad </p><p>of spearmen led him out through </p><p>the chancel door and up to the </p><p>dark-walled keep that towered grimly above </p><p>the close, steep-pitched roofs of Kinlochan. </p><p> Duncan gently took the murdered justi-</p><p>ciar in his arms, and plucked at the hilt of </p><p>the dagger. With all his strength, he could </p><p>not stir it. </p><p> “If I were as credulous as these towns-</p><p>folk, I might believe it was indeed the devil’s </p><p>work,” he muttered. “No man in Scotland </p><p>could plunge a knife so hard into human </p><p>flesh that I could not draw it out. It must </p><p>have gone through a rib as an old wife’s </p><p>paddle goes through new butter.” </p><p> “Devil’s work it was, you may lay to</p><p>that,” a hearty voice answered his musing.</p><p>“Let me get hold of the hilt, Master Cap- </p><p>tain; I am a cordwainer by trade, and my </p><p>fingers are strong.” </p><p> Flushing at the implied slur, Duncan rose</p><p>and faced him. The speaker was a heavy- </p><p>shouldered, muscular man of about thirty, </p><p>with handsome, hard features, and cold </p><p>black eyes that roved about with bold </p><p>restlessness. </p><p> “What is your name, and who gave you</p><p>leave to pass the guard?” Duncan de- </p><p>manded. </p><p>The Devil’s Dagger </p><p> “Malcolm Carmichael, citizen of Kin-</p><p>lochan, and of good repute. I was admitted </p><p>because I brought a message for you. By </p><p>your leave, I will pluck out this knife for </p><p>you.” </p><p> And suiting the action to the word, he</p><p>seized the hilt with one brawny hand, laid </p><p>the other against the earl’s breast, and </p><p>wrenched out the dagger. </p><p> Duncan caught up the man’s hand, took</p><p>the weapon from it, and examined the palm </p><p>and fingers. </p><p> “Those callouses were made by a sword,</p><p>not by a cordwainer’s knife,” he said </p><p>sternly. </p><p> “All free citizens bear arms, and have</p><p>occasion to use them against the king’s </p><p>enemies,” the other replied carelessly. </p><p> “True,” Duncan admitted; then, fixing</p><p>his keen eyes upon him, he asked: </p><p> “What was the message you spoke of?</p><p>Speak quickly, for I have work to do.” </p><p>“The provost bade me ask your leave to </p><p>take his daughter, Margaret Cospatrick, </p><p>into my house. Now that her father is in </p><p>prison, she is homeless, poor lass.” </p><p> A reasonable request, and a kindly one;</p><p>but as Duncan searched the man’s face, </p><p>he felt less and less inclined to grant it. </p><p>Cospatrick was held on suspicion of the </p><p>most heinous offense: high treason and </p><p>murder; and therefore, by the hard law </p><p>of the time, his house and goods passed </p><p>automatically and at once to the crown. </p><p>His daughter was homeless, in a town </p><p>overrun with men-at-arms and probably </p><p>infested with dangerous characters; yet, to </p><p>Duncan’s eyes, Malcolm Carmichael did </p><p>not look like a safe guardian for the girl. </p><p>He did not trust the man; and he did </p><p>trust his own ability to read men’s hearts in </p><p>their faces. </p><p> “I will not,” he answered angrily. “You</p><p>had best go home, Carmichael, and look </p><p>well to your actions. It is an old saying </p><p>that he who plucks the knife out may </p><p>plunge it in.” </p><p> The cordwainer shot a dark look at him;</p><p>but before either could speak another word, </p><p>a woman’s shriek rang above the murmur </p><p>of the scattering crowd and the threats </p><p>of the soldiers, who were clearing the square. </p><p>Carmichael darted past Mclvor to the far </p><p>end of the platform between the top of the </p><p>steps and the cathedral door, and dis- </p><p>appeared ’round the corner of the building. </p><p>Following swiftly on his heels, Duncan saw </p><p>a young girl struggling in the grasp of two </p><p>spearmen, upon one of whom Carmichael </p><p>was leaping from behind. </p><p> Reaching out swiftly, Duncan swept the</p><p>cordwainer off his feet, and flung him down; </p><p>then he struck first one and then the other </p><p>soldier across the face with his open palm. </p><p>The men fell back, recognized him, and </p><p>hastened down the steps in alarm. </p><p> “I ask your pardon,” Duncan addressed</p><p>the girl, “for the incivility of my men, </p><p>who-” </p><p> “Your men?” she exclaimed, her brown</p><p>eyes opening wide with surprised alarm. </p><p>“Then it was you that sent my father to </p><p>prison!” </p><p> “If you are Margaret Cospatrick, I must</p><p>own that I did send your father to prison,” </p><p>he answered with a trace of shame. </p><p> As he spoke, he surveyed her with as</p><p>much admiration as was compatible with </p><p>respect. She was dressed richly, as became </p><p>the daughter of a wealthy burgess and one </p><p>who held the high office of provost; tall, </p><p>slender, and with the most exquisite </p><p>features, she would have graced the regent’s </p><p>court. Her cheeks still glowed with the </p><p>effort of her struggle, and in her disheveled </p><p>garments, she seemed an offended queen. </p><p> “You must know that my father is</p><p>innocent of this crime,” she protested. “I </p><p>saw you at your post as I came forth from </p><p>the church; you must have observed all </p><p>that happened, and seen that he could not </p><p>have dealt the stroke.” </p><p> Duncan flushed; he could not remove</p><p>his eyes from the angry girl, and her very </p><p>beauty seemed to argue the truth of her </p><p>words. </p><p> “When the king’s justiciar is struck down</p><p>within the limits of a town,” he answered, </p><p>struggling for composure, “that town is </p><p>held to answer for the deed, and its officers </p><p>are under arrest until the murderer is found. </p><p>I hope with all my heart that your father </p><p>may clear himself. But I would not </p><p>willingly bring hardship upon you. Your </p><p>house is now the king’s, but you have my </p><p>consent to occupy it until the regent sends </p><p>his deputy to take over the town and </p><p>inquire into the murder.” </p><p> With charming grace, but with uncon-</p><p>cealed scorn, she swept him a low courtesy, </p><p>and majestically descended the steps. </p><p>Duncan turned to Carmichael, who stood </p><p>regarding him sourly. </p><p> “Henceforth you will take care not to</p><p>Adventure </p><p>lay hands on a soldier of the king,” he </p><p>warned the cordwainer. “This time I </p><p>pardon you, for it was done in defense of a </p><p>lady. The next time, it will mean death.” </p><p> Without a word, Carmichael strode away</p><p>down the cathedral steps. Watching him, </p><p>Duncan saw him follow Margaret Cos- </p><p>patrick, and strike up a narrow street </p><p>after her. Suspecting something vaguely </p><p>evil in the man’s purpose, he beckoned the </p><p>nearest soldier to him, and pointed in the </p><p>direction Carmichael had taken. </p><p> “A tall fellow in murray and black has</p><p>just gone up that street yonder,” he said. </p><p>“Follow him, and report to me where he </p><p>goes, with whom he speaks, and where he </p><p>lives.” </p><p> McIVOR established his headquar-</p><p>ters in the keep, a small but thick- </p><p>walled and easily defended castle </p><p>that had once been the lonely stronghold </p><p>of the cattle-lifting robber lords of Kin- </p><p>lochan, the last of whom had died, with a </p><p>lance through his body, a century since. </p><p>Now that a city had grown up ’round the </p><p>old castle, it served as a citadel and the </p><p>arsenal of the town’s train-band. The </p><p>captain of that train-band, together with </p><p>most of the other municipal officers, had </p><p>been placed under arrest, for their loyalty </p><p>was open to question, and Duncan was </p><p>taking no chances of letting any man </p><p>escape who might have an interest in the </p><p>death of the king’s justiciar. </p><p> His severity caused the townsfolk to</p><p>mutter ominously, for it was plain that </p><p>they regarded the murder as the work </p><p>of some supernatural power. Had they </p><p>not seen the dagger stand forth in Carfrae’s </p><p>breast, with no hand raised to plant it </p><p>there? Then why were peaceful burgesses </p><p>thrown into prison, when a thousand men </p><p>had seen them standing innocently by at the </p><p>commission of the deed? </p><p> Discontent was doubly dangerous in</p><p>Kinlochan, in the heart of the district </p><p>infested by Evan the Outlaw, “the Head- </p><p>less,” as men called him. The brigand </p><p>was credited with uncanny powers; he had </p><p>the entire countryside in terror of him; </p><p>his raids were swift, irresistible. Though </p><p>all that territory had suffered at his hands,</p><p>no man had ever seen his face, for he </p><p>appeared always in full armor, with his face </p><p>concealed by the vizor of his helmet. The </p><p>superstitious countryfolk said that he was </p><p>an evil spirit, and whispered that there was </p><p>no head within that helmet, nothing but a </p><p>grinning skull. It was this superstition </p><p>which had given him his title. </p><p> But cruel and uncanny as he was, he</p><p>had stood by Robert, young Malcolm’s </p><p>unsuccessful rival to the throne, with a </p><p>devotion which won him as much affection </p><p>from the men of Kinlochan as they dared </p><p>show. He never raided this town, and he </p><p>shared the proceeds of his pillage with the </p><p>rash young townsmen who smuggled across </p><p>the near-by Highland border. Moreover, </p><p>if Kinlochan was loyal to the boy-king </p><p>Malcolm with its head, it was loyal to the </p><p>defeated Robert with its sentimental heart, </p><p>and Evan was a hero to the townsfolk, if </p><p>he was something of a terror to them also. </p><p> Duncan Mclvor knew that he and his</p><p>company of spearmen stood in grave danger </p><p>if Evan chose this all too opportune mo- </p><p>ment for a dash into the city; the grumbling </p><p>citizens were almost certain to join hands </p><p>with the outlaw. The king’s men were too </p><p>few to hold the walls against a numerous </p><p>and determined enemy, with treason menac- </p><p>ing them from within. Therefore, detach- </p><p>ing just enough men to hold the city gate </p><p>and patrol the streets at night, he called </p><p>in the rest of his command at sunset and </p><p>posted them in the keep. This, at least, </p><p>he could hold, and keep the king’s flag </p><p>flying, till his messenger could summon </p><p>reenforcements from the capital. </p><p> Standing in the red light that streamed</p><p>in through one of the narrow slits pierced </p><p>in the stone wall for archers to shoot </p><p>through, he examined the fatal dagger, </p><p>“the devil’s dagger,” as townsfolk and </p><p>soldiers called it. Never in his life had </p><p>he seen such a weapon. About twelve </p><p>inches long, it had a simple cross-hilt that </p><p>was flush with the sides of the thick blade. </p><p>The blade itself was flat, and instead of </p><p>tapering toward the point, it broadened </p><p>out like a spearhead, so that it was very </p><p>heavy near the point, which was ground </p><p>both for piercing and for cutting. The </p><p>haft had no pommel, but was blunt, square, </p><p>and very rough at the end.</p><p> “A bad weapon for a fight,” Duncan</p><p>mused; “ill-balanced, but apt for throwing. </p><p>Yet this was not thrown, at least not by </p><p>any mortal man. But that Earl Carfrae </p><p>was slain by the devil I will not admit, for </p><p>there are too many in this town who would </p><p>have been glad to do it.” </p><p>The Devil’s Dagger </p><p> He searched the steel for a smith’s mark;</p><p>and at last he found one, or the almost </p><p>obliterated trace of one, near the guard. </p><p>It had been nearly filed out, and then </p><p>smoothed over skilfully. He could barely </p><p>make out the letters “-rg—i.” </p><p> “No Scottish mark that,” he commented.</p><p>“It is an outland weapon. Why should </p><p>the devil use a foreign blade, when there </p><p>are enough smiths here to supply him? If </p><p>it had been made in Scotland, I should have </p><p>laid the deed to Evan the Headless, or to </p><p>one of his cutthroats.” </p><p> An iron-studded door opened and a man-</p><p>at-arms entered. </p><p> “There is a fellow here to speak with you,</p><p>Captain,” he announced. </p><p> “Who sends him?”</p><p> “Cospatrick’s daughter.”</p><p> “Bid him enter,” Duncan commanded;</p><p>and the soldier thrust a cringing servant </p><p>into the room. </p><p> The fellow stood twirling his leather cap</p><p>in his hands, plainly frightened. </p><p> “Well?” Duncan queried. “Say on, man;</p><p>there’s naught to fear.” </p><p> “The lady Margaret commands me,”</p><p>the servant stammered, “to ask your lord- </p><p>ship if you would see her.” </p><p> Smiling at the unmerited title the scared</p><p>fellow gave him, Mclvor asked: </p><p> “Surely she would not come here? It</p><p>is a poor place for a lady.” </p><p> “She would have you come to her father’s</p><p>house, if your lordship pleases.” </p><p> “I will come at once,” Duncan answered,</p><p>with alacrity that surprised himself. “Is </p><p>it far, my lad?” </p><p> “Across the square, two streets down and</p><p>up a wynd,” the servant replied. </p><p>I “AND you dare refuse to release</p><p>my father, when you know him to </p><p>be innocent?” Margaret’s brown </p><p>eyes flashed with a scorn that was near </p><p>hatred. </p><p> “I did not say that I knew him to be</p><p>innocent,” Duncan protested. “I know </p><p>that he did not strike the blow, and his </p><p>face is that of an honest man; but the town </p><p>has an ill repute, and I can not swear that </p><p>any man in it may not have had a hand in </p><p>the murder.” </p><p> “But you believe in him?” the girl urged,</p><p>almost tearfully. </p><p> “What I believe matters little. The</p><p>king’s regent will send his deputy to judge </p><p>the case; I have nothing to do with his </p><p>verdict, and most certainly I can not set </p><p>the provost free except by the deputy’s </p><p>order. I will speak to him favorably con- </p><p>cerning your father: that is all I can do.” </p><p>“The whole town will speak for him; </p><p>we have no need of your intercession,” the </p><p>girl replied, her Up curling. “I should not </p><p>have expected a woman’s word to move </p><p>you, when mercy and justice will not.” </p><p>“Mercy and justice are not in my hands,” </p><p>Duncan remarked quietly. “Would you </p><p>have me false to my duty to please you?” </p><p> “I see that you would not stir a finger</p><p>to please me,” she flashed back. “I can </p><p>not ask you to go, for you have taken my </p><p>very house from me, and allow me to remain </p><p>in it only by sufferance.” </p><p> “You need not ask me; I am going.</p><p>But if it will give you any comfort, I am </p><p>doing all in my power to find the murderer; </p><p>and if I succeed, and it is proved that the </p><p>provost had no dealings with him, your </p><p>father will be freed. I think I could name </p><p>the villain now, but to lay hands on him is </p><p>a harder matter.” </p><p> Margaret started forward impulsively.</p><p>“Forgive me for my harsh words!” she </p><p>cried. “I was beside myself with grief. </p><p>In Heaven’s name, who is the man?” </p><p> “If I am not mistaken, it was the one man</p><p>who had most to gain by the justiciar’s </p><p>death. I do not yet know what devilish </p><p>arts he used, but I feel sure that Evan the </p><p>Headless slew him.”</p><p> “Oh, do not name that man!” Margaret</p><p>cried, her face pale with terror. “His spies </p><p>are in every household; to breathe a word </p><p>against him is death!” </p><p> “Nevertheless, if he dares come within</p><p>reach of my arm, I will do my best to bring </p><p>the deed home to him,” Duncan assured </p><p>her. “He will be Evan the Headless in </p><p>very truth if he shows himself in Kin- </p><p>lochan.” </p><p> The curtains parted, and Malcolm Car-</p><p>michael’s bold, sinister face smiled at them </p><p>across the room. </p><p> “This is foolish talk.,” he gibed. “Evan</p><p>knows more than to thrust his neck into </p><p>the snare. He appears only when he is not </p><p>looked for.” </p><p> Duncan flushed angrily.</p><p> “Master Cordwainer,” he said, “I have</p><p>warned you twice not to interfere in the </p><p>king’s business. I warn you now for the </p><p>last time. I know not who let you into </p><p>170 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>this house, but it is the king’s house for the </p><p>present, and it is no longer open to you. </p><p>If I ever find you in it again, I will put you </p><p>in safe-keeping.” </p><p> Carmichael did not so much as look at</p><p>him. </p><p> “By your leave, Margaret,” he addressed</p><p>the girl, “I must find fault with you for </p><p>dealing with this king’s man, when you </p><p>have good friends to help you. I grieve </p><p>much that your father is falsely imprisoned, </p><p>and I will do all I can to bring him back </p><p>to you safely. I ask but one reward if I suc- </p><p>ceed, and you know what that is. I leave </p><p>you now, since I am forbidden to stay.” </p><p>And with a sneering smile at Duncan, he </p><p>disappeared through the curtains. </p><p> Replacing his helmet, Duncan turned to</p><p>follow him; but Margaret stopped him. </p><p> “My uncle, Martin Gillespie, will go with</p><p>you,” she said; and opening a panel in the </p><p>further wall, she called twice. </p><p> In a moment a short, pursy man came in,</p><p>puffing with exertion, his great stomach </p><p>shaking at every step. He kissed the girl, </p><p>bowed to Duncan, and took the young </p><p>man’s arm. </p><p> When they reached the darkest spot in</p><p>the pitch-black wynd, Gillespie stopped, </p><p>and drew Duncan toward him. </p><p> “It were best for all concerned, Master</p><p>Mclvor,” he whispered, “if ye left the </p><p>provost’s door unbarred this night, and sent </p><p>the guard away.” </p><p> “What do you mean?” Duncan asked in</p><p>indignant surprise. </p><p> “Not so loud,” the fat man wheezed.</p><p>“It may mean death if we are overheard. </p><p>Are ye fond of the sight of blood, young </p><p>man? Do ye like to see good men killed </p><p>for nothing?” </p><p> “Are you mad?” Duncan replied.</p><p> “It is you who are mad. The townsfolk</p><p>love their provost; if ye hang him, they will</p><p>throw themselves upon you. Then there </p><p>will be a deal of killing, much harmless </p><p>blood will be spilt, and the good town of </p><p>Kinlochan will be laid waste. I love this </p><p>town, young man, and I would not see </p><p>these ill things happen. Therefore I warn </p><p>you, let the provost escape. Ye need not </p><p>fear for yourself. When the deputy comes, </p><p>you say that Evan the Headless surprised </p><p>the guard and took him away. A few </p><p>hacked swords and a little pig’s blood will </p><p>give color to the tale, and many men will </p><p>thank you for it.” </p><p> Duncan took Gillespie’s face in his hands,</p><p>and held it close to his own. </p><p> “Look you,” he said, “I have as much</p><p>regard for innocent lives as you have. I </p><p>would do anything honest to avoid blood- </p><p>shed; I have given my men orders to keep </p><p>peace with the townsfolk at all hazards. </p><p>But what you propose is not honest, and </p><p>I will not listen to it. The provost stays </p><p>in prison till the deputy comes.” </p><p> “Who is the deputy?” Gillespie asked.</p><p> “I do not know; it will probably be the</p><p>Earl of Ross, who is near by, and has the </p><p>high, low, and middle justice.” </p><p> The merchant groaned.</p><p> “Ross!” he cried. “ ‘Black’ David!</p><p>There is neither pity nor justice in himl” </p><p>“He is as just as he is stern,” Duncan con- </p><p>tradicted. “His verdict will be fair.” And </p><p>he turned to go. </p><p> The other dragged at his arm.</p><p> “Wait!” he «pleaded. “If ye will do</p><p>nothing for our sakes, consider yourselves! </p><p>Though the townsfolk are too weak to with- </p><p>stand you, they may not be alone! Let </p><p>Cospatrick go!” </p><p> Duncan turned on him.</p><p> “So Evan the Headless is with you! It</p><p>is unsafe to tell such treason to a king’s </p><p>officer!” </p><p> “I never spoke his name!” Gillespie pro-</p><p>tested. “I am no traitor, good sir!” </p><p> “Then you will do well to wait till the</p><p>deputy comes,” Mclvor sternly admonished </p><p>him. </p><p> The merchant’s distress was pitiful.</p><p>“But I tell ye,” he whined, “it is </p><p>death to wait! The blood of many men </p><p>will be on your head. Let him go at </p><p>once! If ye wait till tomorrow, it may be </p><p>too late!” </p><p> Duncan tore himself away.</p><p> “You are either mad or a traitor,” he said</p><p>scornfully. “For Mistress Margaret’s sake, </p><p>I will call you mad, and let you go, but do </p><p>not approach me again.” </p><p> Leaving Gillespie quaking in the dark-</p><p>ness, the young captain returned to the </p><p>keep. There he found a messenger from </p><p>the capital, dusty with hard riding. </p><p> “The regent can not send reinforce-</p><p>ments,” he reported. “The Islesmen are up </p><p>in arms, and he needs every man; but the </p><p>Earl of Ross will be here with a small escort </p><p>by noon tomorrow. He bids you have a </p><p>gallows built in front of the church before </p><p>he comes.” </p><p>The Devil’s Dagger </p><p>171 </p><p>DETAILING Kilbeggie and three </p><p>men to this task, Duncan went </p><p>to his quarters and pondered over </p><p>the things he had heard. At first he </p><p>thought only of Carmichael’s strong, evil </p><p>face and arrogant speech. There was </p><p>something under the man’s boldness, or </p><p>he would hardly have been so ready with </p><p>his promises to free the provost; nor would </p><p>he have dared show his ill-will so openly. </p><p>And what was the reward he expected from </p><p>Margaret? </p><p> “The man can not be in love with her?”</p><p>he muttered. “A mere cordwainer!” </p><p> But the thought suited well with Car-</p><p>michael’s insolent behavior; he was a man </p><p>who would dare much, Duncan felt. </p><p> He shuddered at the idea of this fellow</p><p>in possession of so lovely and spirited a </p><p>girl; and suddenly it came over him that </p><p>such a thing would be more terrible to him </p><p>than any death. </p><p> “St. Andrew!” he cried to himself. “Am</p><p>I to fall in love with the daughter of a man </p><p>who may be swinging in a rope this time </p><p>tomorrow?” And after a moment’s re- </p><p>flection: “What if I do?” he asked. </p><p>“Whether he be hanged or not, I believe </p><p>him honest, and his daughter is fair enough </p><p>and good enough for any man. And come </p><p>what will, I will not let that vile cord- </p><p>wainer have her!” </p><p> But he knew that the morrow might</p><p>bring trouble; the sight of the provost at </p><p>the gallow’s foot might stir the already </p><p>restless townsmen to fury. If it came to a </p><p>fight, and there were anything in Gillespie’s </p><p>implied threat that Evan the Headless </p><p>would bring his outlaws into the battle, </p><p>then Duncan himself would almost certainly </p><p>die. </p><p> “If Carmichael is one of them—!” he</p><p>cried. </p><p> Yes, if Carmichael was in Evan’s pay,</p><p>then defeat for the king’s troops would </p><p>mean that Margaret would fall into Car- </p><p>michael’s hands. She was doubtless prom- </p><p>ised to the man as a reward of his treason!</p><p> “She shall know of it, however,” he</p><p>resolved; and took inkhorn and parchment, </p><p>thanking his stars for the chance that he </p><p>had been brought up in a monastery. A </p><p>little later, he dispatched the following </p><p>letter by a trooper: </p><p>To Mistress Margaret Cospatrick: </p><p> I,	who have brought your father into peril of his</p><p>life, who may yet be the instrument of his death, </p><p>confess without shame that I love you. If your </p><p>father is acquitted tomorrow, I shall ask him for </p><p>your hand; if not, you shall hear of me no more. </p><p>But whatever happens, I will not abate one jot </p><p>of my duty to the king. Beware of Carmichael; </p><p>I have reason to believe him a traitor and a spy of </p><p>Evan’s. Farewell, and the saints be with you. </p><p>Duncan McIvor, Servicns Regis. </p><p> His mind cleared by this confession, he</p><p>reverted almost instantly to the interview </p><p>with Gillespie. As he went over it in his </p><p>mind, five words sang themselves in his ears </p><p>with more and more significance— </p><p>“Morning may be too late!” </p><p> He sprang to his feet.</p><p> “Would to God I had questioned that</p><p>fat dolt more closely!” he reproached him- </p><p>self. “He knows more than I gave him </p><p>credit for! Here, Henderson!” </p><p> The lantern-jawed patrol leader had</p><p>ridden in at sunset to report the district </p><p>quiet and no sign of Evan and his outlaws. </p><p>He now appeared promptly, though yawn- </p><p>ing and obviously saddle-sore. </p><p> “Take charge here,” ordered Duncan,</p><p>“I go to the city gate, to consult with </p><p>Jamieson there on matters of importance, </p><p>and may not be back till dawn.” </p><p> Without waiting for an answer, he</p><p>snatched up a black cloak to hide the </p><p>gleam of his mail, and crossed the city to </p><p>where his second in command kept restless </p><p>watch at the gate. </p><p> “Best take a patrol with you, Captain,”</p><p>he urged, when Mclvor told him of his </p><p>suspicions and his intention to probe them </p><p>personally.</p><p> “How many can you spare me, of your</p><p>score?” asked Dunam. </p><p> “Not one—we are too few to hold the</p><p>gate-house now-” </p><p> “The same is true of the keep,” inter-</p><p>rupted Duncan. “So I go alone—to ques- </p><p>tion a fat old carle who could not harm a </p><p>hare. Remember, your duty, and Hen- </p><p>derson’s, is to hold the town till the deputy </p><p>comes. Farewell.” </p><p> As Mclvor readjusted his cloak and</p><p>turned away, Jamieson saw that he was </p><p>carrying, stuck through his belt, the devil’s </p><p>dagger—at midnight, too, when, as all men </p><p>know, the Evil One has power! The super- </p><p>stitious Borderer crossed himself and gave </p><p>up all hope of ever seeing his young officer </p><p>alive again. </p><p> The moon was up, but the streets and</p><p>houses of Kinlochan were otherwise dark, </p><p>for the captain had given orders for all </p><p>172 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>citizens to be at home and in bed by the </p><p>curfew hour, now long past. As Duncan </p><p>crossed a side street, a man stole out of a </p><p>house-door, closely muffled. Duncan seized </p><p>him by the arm. The man started vio- </p><p>lently. </p><p> “Where does Martin Gillespie live?”</p><p>Duncan questioned. </p><p> Trembling in his grasp, the man pointed</p><p>up the street. </p><p> “Two turns to the left and at the end of</p><p>a close,” he answered. </p><p> “And now, what are you doing out at</p><p>this hour?” </p><p> The fellow faltered.</p><p> “Back in with you, and do not stir out-</p><p>side your door again tonight, on pain of </p><p>death!” snapped Mclvor. </p><p> The other bolted into his house like a</p><p>rabbit into its burrow. </p><p> As he entered into the close to which the</p><p>culprit had directed him, Duncan heard a </p><p>door creak on its hinges, and flattened him- </p><p>self against the high wall which formed the </p><p>side of a tall, rambling house. Watching in- </p><p>tently, he saw a hooded figure steal out softly </p><p>and shut the door behind it. Straining his </p><p>eyes, he made out a massive shape between </p><p>him and the moonlight, a familiar shape, with </p><p>the only stomach of its size in Kinlochan. </p><p>It was Martin Gillespie. </p><p> But though he had come to question</p><p>this very man, the citizen’s illegal appear- </p><p>ance at midnight changed the course of </p><p>Duncan’s intentions. He recognized at </p><p>once that if there was any mischief afoot, </p><p>Gillespie’s nocturnal sortie was proof not </p><p>only of his knowledge of it, but of his </p><p>complicity. Clearly, however much he </p><p>desired to avoid bloodshed, he was still </p><p>more anxious to free the provost. For </p><p>that there was a plot to free the provost, </p><p>by force if necessary, Duncan no longer </p><p>doubted. </p><p> Tiptoeing cautiously toward the street,</p><p>he followed his man’s portly figure to the </p><p>turn, down a narrow, winding side street, </p><p>to the rear entrance of a large, six-story </p><p>house with a high-pitched, many-angled </p><p>roof and a wilderness of chimneys. Gil- </p><p>lespie mounted the steps and looked about </p><p>apprehensively. Duncan dropped to the </p><p>cobblestones just in time, and heard the </p><p>merchant knock at the door four times in </p><p>rapid succession. Instantly the door swung </p><p>open, and closed again as soon as Gillespie </p><p>was inside. </p><p> Waiting long enough to avert suspicion,</p><p>Duncan wound his cloak about his face, </p><p>loosened his sword in its scabbard, and </p><p>judging that the knock was a signal, rapped </p><p>four times, as Gillespie had done. </p><p> The door opened at once; the hall was</p><p>dark. A hand fell on his, and guided him </p><p>down a long passage. At last his guide </p><p>knocked at an invisible door, and a blaze </p><p>of light burst upon them. Stepping over </p><p>the threshold, Duncan found himself in </p><p>an interior room without windows, and </p><p>ventilated only by a small air-shaft. Across </p><p>the room a fire was burning in a grate, </p><p>around which stood or sat a dozen armed </p><p>men. Among them, Duncan recognized </p><p>five of the most prominent and orderly </p><p>citizens of Kinlochan; the rest were ob- </p><p>viously of the poorer sort, but all resolute- </p><p>looking fellows. He noticed with dis- </p><p>appointment that Carmichael was not </p><p>among them. </p><p>IN HIS excitement, Duncan allowed </p><p>the cloak to drop from about his </p><p>head, and his polished helmet caught </p><p>and threw back the firelight. Instantly </p><p>confusion broke loose. Those who were </p><p>seated leaped to their feet; some made for </p><p>the darkest comers of the room, others </p><p>pressed forward toward him, fumbling at </p><p>their sword-hilts. At once Duncan drew </p><p>his own sword, and prepared for defense. </p><p>The room echoed with angry shouts of </p><p>“Kill the king’s man! Cut him to pieces!” </p><p>Yet none seemed anxious to be the first to </p><p>face his blade. </p><p> From the angle of the chimney, Martin</p><p>Gillespie shouldered forward, thrusting his </p><p>great stomach through the press. With an </p><p>effort which left him gasping, he hoisted </p><p>himself up on to the top of a massive table, </p><p>and panting for breath, brought out a shout</p><p>that made the conspirators pause. </p><p> “Harm him not!” he cried. “It was he</p><p>who imprisoned Ronald Cospa trick! Seize </p><p>him, but wound him not; we will hold him </p><p>as hostage for the provost’s safety!” </p><p> Here was the moment on which Duncan</p><p>had counted; when he might, by cool </p><p>reasoning and his own promise to say no </p><p>word of this meeting to the authorities, </p><p>dissuade the citizens from violence and </p><p>armed rebellion. But before he could </p><p>speak, a panel opened in the wall beside the </p><p>chimney; there came the clank of mail, </p><p>a shrill whistle; and a gleaming figure </p><p>The Devil’s Dagger </p><p>173 </p><p>strode into the room. Duncan, his sword </p><p>still outthrust in defense, stared at the </p><p>newcomer in amazement. He was a tall, </p><p>powerfully built man in shining mail, his </p><p>face completely concealed by the vizor </p><p>of his helmet. </p><p> “You crack-brained fools!” the armored</p><p>man said quietly, but in a voice that </p><p>pierced through and silenced the din. </p><p>“You will have the troops here in a moment. </p><p>Kill this fellow quietly, and be done </p><p>with it.” </p><p> “But, good Evan,” Gillespie protested,</p><p>“would it not be more prudent to hold him </p><p>as a hostage? If we slay him, the king’s </p><p>spearmen will butcher us all!” </p><p> “The king’s troops will have enough to do</p><p>to save their own lives,” the outlaw an- </p><p>swered. “This lad here is both brain and </p><p>heart to them; put him out of the way, </p><p>and his men will offer small resistance to- </p><p>morrow. Consider, men of Kinlochan: </p><p>if Mclvor escapes, he will bring a charge </p><p>of high treason against all of you, and then </p><p>it will be hey for a short grace and a long </p><p>rope. Now kill him quickly, or I will call my </p><p>men off and leave you in the lurch.” </p><p> Believing all his enemies were in front of</p><p>him, Duncan had waited calmly until the </p><p>outlaw furnished him with all the informa- </p><p>tion he wished; but he was speedily un- </p><p>deceived. A light appeared at the far end </p><p>of the corridor; the sound of many feet </p><p>came toward him; and before he could dash </p><p>for the street door, that too swung open, </p><p>letting in two tall fellows in steel caps, who </p><p>struck at him fiercely with long knives. </p><p> Duncan had no room to strike back;</p><p>besides, with armored men on both sides </p><p>of him, his position was untenable. There </p><p>was only one way out: forward through </p><p>the crowded room. At least most of his </p><p>opponents there were half-trained, peace- </p><p>loving citizens. Swinging his sword, he </p><p>plunged straight ahead, striking to right </p><p>and left with the flat. Unused to desperate </p><p>fighting, the townsmen made way before </p><p>him, or fell headlong beneath his blows, </p><p>until the captain stood within striking </p><p>distance of Evan the Headless, with no one</p><p>between to save the outlaw from his stroke. </p><p>Duncan raised his sword, felt a weapon </p><p>thud against the stanch steel rings on his </p><p>back, and realized instantly that he had no </p><p>time to fight. </p><p> Lowering his point, he dealt Evan a</p><p>mighty blow with his left fist against the </p><p>meshed mail covering the throat. The </p><p>outlaw fell heavily, still struggling to </p><p>release his sword from the scabbard in </p><p>which it was jammed. Like a flash, </p><p>Duncan leapt over the prostrate man, </p><p>through the panel, and found himself at </p><p>the foot of a secret stair, lighted with candles </p><p>stuck in sconces on the wall. He slammed </p><p>the panel shut, and dashed up the stair, </p><p>extinguishing the candles behind him as he </p><p>ran. The stair wound in a spiral, without </p><p>so much as a door opening from it, story </p><p>up after story. </p><p> Behind him the well roared with the</p><p>clatter of his pursuers’ feet upon the wooden </p><p>treads. Clad as he was in complete chain- </p><p>mail, his breath came shorter and shorter, </p><p>till he no longer blew out the candles as </p><p>he passed them but struck them out with </p><p>his hand. If there were only a door </p><p>through which he might dodge! What if </p><p>this way led him into an impasse, a room </p><p>from which there was no exit? But trap </p><p>or no trap, he must go through it to the </p><p>end. </p><p> Suddenly he shot out through an open</p><p>door into a large, meagerly furnished room. </p><p>Slamming the door behind him, Duncan </p><p>hunted for and found a bolt, and shot it, </p><p>just as the first of the pursuers hurled him- </p><p>self against the other side of the door. </p><p>Looking for something to barricade it with, </p><p>Duncan laid hands on the large table, </p><p>on which a candle was burning, in the </p><p>center of the room. His eyes fell on a piece </p><p>of parchment beside the candle. It was </p><p>his own letter to Margaret Cospatrick! </p><p> But it was more than his own writing.</p><p>Added to it, like a postscript, were the </p><p>following lines: </p><p>Malcolm Carmichael: </p><p> I know by this that you are a traitor. For the</p><p>sake of the love you say you have for me, I will </p><p>not give you over to the soldiers; but I command</p><p>you to leave Kinlochan at once and never look upon </p><p>my face again. If you have had a part in the </p><p>crime of which my father is falsely accused, and I </p><p>ever obtain proof of it, I will denounce you. </p><p>Margaret Cospatrick. </p><p> The crashing impact of a heavy battle-ax</p><p>on the other side of the bolted door, and the </p><p>gleam of its edge through the splintering </p><p>panel, recalled Duncan to a sense of his </p><p>present danger. Hastily placing the parch- </p><p>ment within his helmet, he thrust the table </p><p>against the door leading to the secret stair. </p><p>Across the room was another door, with a </p><p>174 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>great iron key in the massive lock. Bound- </p><p>ing over to it, he whipped out the key, </p><p>opened the door, sprang through, closed </p><p>and locked it from the outside. </p><p> Looking about him, Duncan now found</p><p>himself in a long, narrow attic, lit by the </p><p>moonlight streaming in through a solitary </p><p>dormer window at the far end. Half-way </p><p>between him and the window, the head of </p><p>a staircase rose through the dusty floor. </p><p>Here was a possible means of escape to </p><p>the street, and Duncan hastened to it </p><p>eagerly. But even as he did so, there came </p><p>a rush of feet on the floor below, and a </p><p>throng of men swept swiftly up the stair. </p><p>Their leader, a tall fellow armed with sword </p><p>and buckler, gave a joyous cry at the sight </p><p>of the captain’s figure outlined against the </p><p>moonlit window. </p><p>i QUICK as thought, Duncan </p><p>1 dropped his own sword, and laid </p><p>hold of a great iron-bound clothes- </p><p>chest that stood beside him at the </p><p>head of the stair. With the strength of </p><p>desperation, he heaved it up at arms’ </p><p>length above his head. At the sight of </p><p>the huge bulk poised, black and threaten- </p><p>ing, before him, the leader of the attackers </p><p>crouched behind his upraised shield, but </p><p>in vain. Like a stone from a catapult, </p><p>the monstrous missile came crashing down, </p><p>crushing the life out of two men, transfixing </p><p>a third upon the sword of the man behind </p><p>him, and sweeping them all into a tangled, </p><p>shrieking heap at the bottom of the stair. </p><p> A sudden thunder of blows on the other</p><p>side of the locked door told Duncan that </p><p>those who had pursued him up the secret </p><p>stair would soon be through into the attic. </p><p>Through the cries and curses of the wounded, </p><p>he could hear more men coming up the </p><p>lower flights of the staircase he had just </p><p>cleared; obviously there was no escape </p><p>for him that way, nor could he hope to hold </p><p>the stairway against attack from both front </p><p>and rear. </p><p> Running lightly to the far end of the</p><p>attic, Duncan climbed through the narrow </p><p>window out on to the steeply sloping roof. </p><p>There he took up his position, to the right </p><p>of the window and a half-step higher up</p><p>the roof, his left hand resting on the ridge </p><p>of the little dormer, his sword upraised and </p><p>ready. Soon he heard the door of the inner </p><p>room come crashing down. In an instant, </p><p>the attic seemed full of men, shaking the </p><p>house as they rushed back and forth across </p><p>the floor, overturning chests and boxes, and </p><p>thrusting their sword-points into every nook </p><p>and comer. </p><p> Presently, a man wearing a steel cap</p><p>went to the window and put his head out. </p><p>Still wearing the steep cap, his head rolled </p><p>down the slope of the roof, fell over the edge, </p><p>and lodged in a sort of valley between two </p><p>lower gables. </p><p> Those within came thronging to where</p><p>the headless trunk lay by the window in a </p><p>widening pool of blood that looked like ink </p><p>in the moonlight; but no man offered to </p><p>step across it and beneath the terrible blade </p><p>that they knew was waiting outside. </p><p> “Come, Evan the Headless,” called</p><p>Duncan in grim mockery. “What have </p><p>you to fear?” </p><p> But Evan stirred not, nor made reply,</p><p>till one of his followers suggested that some </p><p>of them go out another window. </p><p> “This is the only window from which this</p><p>part of the roof can be reached,” Duncan </p><p>heard the deep voice of the outlaw say </p><p>decisively. “We have the young fool safely </p><p>trapped now. Bar fast the shutter, post </p><p>four to watch here and leave the rest to me.” </p><p>*A solid shutter of heavy boards was </p><p>promptly placed in the unsashed window </p><p>and made fast from within. </p><p> Thus left alone on the roof of the house,</p><p>Duncan sheathed his sword, climbed to the </p><p>high-pitched ridge-pole and looked about </p><p>him, by the bright light of a nearly full </p><p>moon. He was trapped indeed, on the top </p><p>of a sort of tower that rose fully two stories </p><p>above the rest of the house. There was </p><p>not as much as a chimney-pot for him to </p><p>take cover behind, and at any moment </p><p>he might hear the twang of a bowstring </p><p>from a dark corner of the roof below and </p><p>feel a cloth-yard shaft tear through his shirt </p><p>of mail. Listening apprehensively, he sud- </p><p>denly heard a voice, the voice of Martin </p><p>Gillespie, speak these words, apparently</p><p>in his very ear. </p><p> “Evan had best haste over the wall and</p><p>ride hard, if he is to bring his two hundred </p><p>lances here by tomorrow noon.” </p><p> In his astonishment, Duncan nearly fell</p><p>to his death in the street below. Looking </p><p>about him, he discovered a low, hooded </p><p>opening in the roof, and realized that it was </p><p>the top of the airshaft ventilating the room </p><p>on the ground floor where the conspirators </p><p>met. But the shaft was far too narrow for </p><p>The Devil’s Dagger </p><p>175 </p><p>his broad shoulders ever to squeeze through. </p><p>He must find some other means of escape. </p><p> Then there came to Duncan’s ears the</p><p>blessed sound of the tramp of disciplined </p><p>feet, and he knew that one of his own patrols </p><p>was passing by. A shout rose to his lips; </p><p>but he checked it, realizing that to call out </p><p>thus from the housetops would almost </p><p>certainly rouse the town and start a general </p><p>fight that otherwise might be avoided— </p><p>for now he knew that the other side would </p><p>not be ready to strike till tomorrow noon. </p><p> By the loom of St. Andrew’s cathedral</p><p>tower against the sky, Duncan saw that </p><p>this great rambling house on whose roof </p><p>he sat was much nearer than lie had realized </p><p>to the square; so much so that its front </p><p>in all probability faced on it. If he could </p><p>but work his way to that end of the roof, </p><p>he might succeed in attracting the attention </p><p>of the patrol without giving the alarm. </p><p> Swinging his right leg over the ridgepole,</p><p>Duncan made his way down the moonless </p><p>side of the roof, cautiously, for the slope was </p><p>steep and the old, moss-grown slates were </p><p>slippery. Half-way down, he turned and </p><p>began to walk as fast as he dared along the </p><p>slope toward the front. He was two-thirds </p><p>of the way there when, without an instant’s </p><p>warning, a cracked slate snapped off and </p><p>broke away beneath his tread; his feet flew </p><p>out from under him, he fell heavily on his </p><p>right side, and shot, feet foremost, down the </p><p>slope and over the edge of the roof. </p><p> “St. Andrew, save me!” he prayed, as he</p><p>fell through the dark. </p><p> Then he struck; not, as he had feared,</p><p>on the pavement but on the lower roof. </p><p>This also sloped so steeply that his fall was </p><p>not broken abruptly; but again turned into </p><p>a slide. Down he shot with increasing </p><p>velocity, for now he was in a sort of trough </p><p>between two gables, slippery with slime </p><p>left there by the rains of many Winters. </p><p>Vainly clutching for any handhold, he felt </p><p>his legs shoot over the edge of the roof, </p><p>and his body follow and fall once more </p><p>straight down, this time to certain death. </p><p>Then, miraculously, his hands touched and </p><p>gripped something hard and round.</p><p> Looking up, Duncan saw that he was</p><p>hanging, at arms’ length, from a long water- </p><p>spout, with its mouth shaped like a dragon’s </p><p>head; just such a gargoyle as then projected </p><p>from the eyes of any large dwelling, or may </p><p>be seen grinning from the tower of a Gothic </p><p>cathedral today. Thanks to his wearing </p><p>chain-mail, his skin was untorn, and he was </p><p>none the worse save for a few bruises. </p><p>Silently thanking St. Andrew, Duncan </p><p>began to pull himself up, to climb on the </p><p>lower roof and there try his fortunes anew. </p><p>But, before he had raised himself an inch, </p><p>he saw something that so startled him that </p><p>he nearly relaxed his hold on the waterspout. </p><p> Directly in front of him, as he hung, and</p><p>perhaps a dozen feet away, the side of the </p><p>house was built out at right angles. </p><p>Through a window in this wing, Duncan </p><p>could now look down into a lighted room, </p><p>where, beside a table on which a candle </p><p>was burning, loomed the mail-clad bulk of </p><p>Evan the Headless. The outlaw appeared </p><p>to be talking with some one who sat on the </p><p>other side of the table. All that Duncan </p><p>could see of this person was a lean brown </p><p>hand, that rested on the table where the </p><p>candlelight was brightest. What startled </p><p>him was that this hand was clutching a </p><p>duplicate of the devil’s dagger! </p><p>“WHERE is Duncan Mclvor, who </p><p>should command here?” </p><p> Black David, Earl of Ross, sat</p><p>on his horse in the city gate and glowered </p><p>down at the unhappy Jamieson. Wriggling </p><p>under the merciless black eyes of the king’s </p><p>deputy, the embarrassed Borderer stam- </p><p>mered out a tangled tale of midnight and </p><p>devil’s daggers and black magic; the gist </p><p>of which was that the captain had disap- </p><p>peared and that the search parties Jamieson </p><p>had sent out had failed to find the slightest </p><p>trace of him. </p><p> “Fool!” said Black David, contemptu-</p><p>ously. “When you had the provost and </p><p>half the other town-officers in the keep! </p><p>A touch of hot coals to their feet or a few </p><p>twists of a cord ’round their skulls, and </p><p>they would have told all. Out of the way, </p><p>there! Forward!” </p><p> Followed by his own scanty escort of ten</p><p>mounted men-at-arms and forty archers, </p><p>the Earl of Ross rode, unwelcomed, through </p><p>the streets of Kinlochan. Contrary to the </p><p>wont of folk whose town is visited by a </p><p>king’s deputy, the people had not assembled </p><p>in the square to witness the spectacle and </p><p>the trial. At every house-door, however, </p><p>and at every street-corner, men were wait- </p><p>ing in grim and ominous silence. Not a </p><p>woman or a child was to be seen, except </p><p>here and there at a high window, the </p><p>shutters of which were half-closed. </p><p>176 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Ross knew the signs and prepared for</p><p>battle. In an incredibly short time after </p><p>he had ridden in through the entrance to </p><p>the keep, he rode out again, clad now in full </p><p>armor. Behind him marched his own half- </p><p>hundred and most of Mclvor’s company, </p><p>the latter guarding the provost, the captain </p><p>of the train-band, and the other municipal </p><p>officers, in chains. Marshaling his men </p><p>in battle array at the foot of the gallows, </p><p>Black David ordered the hostages to mount </p><p>the scaffold. </p><p>ONE other person was asking, in an </p><p>anguish of suspense: “Where is </p><p>Duncan Mclvor?” It was Mar- </p><p>garet Cospatrick, who sat watching the </p><p>ominous preparations from the balcony </p><p>of a window’ overlooking the scaffold. </p><p>Not all her uncle’s protestations could </p><p>persuade her to withdraw behind the </p><p>shutters. </p><p> “He said he would find the murderer,”</p><p>she insisted, “and unless harm comes to him, </p><p>he will.” </p><p> “I tell ye, lass, he must be dead,” the</p><p>merchant urged. “He would not fail to </p><p>meet the earl otherwise. The town rings </p><p>with rumors of his murder at the hands of </p><p>the outlaws.” </p><p> Prudent Martin was not the man to con-</p><p>fess his own part in Duncan’s disappear- </p><p>ance. </p><p> “It would take more than a few cowardly</p><p>outlaws to kill him,” Margaret flashed, </p><p>“and he is not the man to leave a helpless </p><p>girl without comfort when her father is at </p><p>the point of death.” </p><p> The frantic Martin was moved to rude-</p><p>ness. </p><p> “One would say ye were foolish over the</p><p>lad,” he exploded. “It does not become </p><p>a decent girl, whose father is about to hang, </p><p>to waste grief on one of Iris murderers.” </p><p> The girl turned on him, her face scarlet.</p><p> “Martin Gillespie!” she cried, the tears</p><p>gathering in her eyes, “if you were twice</p><p>my uncle, you have no right to talk of me </p><p>thus, or to abuse a good man. Aye, he is a </p><p>good man. He did but do his duty, and </p><p>then threw himself into peril for my sake. </p><p>For all we know, he may be lying dead for </p><p>my sake this moment! He loved me, and </p><p>if he comes back alive, I will not forget what </p><p>he did for my love!” </p><p> Martin Gillespie became purple and</p><p>choked. </p><p>“BE IT made known, in the name </p><p>of the king, that the town of Kin- </p><p>lochan is held suspect of the murder </p><p>of Sir Hugh Kennedy, Earl of Carfrae, </p><p>Justiciar of his Majesty. Be it known that </p><p>the said town is also suspect of making way </p><p>with and murdering one Duncan Mclvor, </p><p>in command of the king’s troops, occupy- </p><p>ing the said town. Wherefore, in the </p><p>king’s name, I, David, Earl of Ross, </p><p>deputy for the king, do hereby command </p><p>that unless the murderer or murderers be </p><p>produced within half the space of an hour, </p><p>the provost and officers of the said town </p><p>of Kinlochan be duly and well hanged, </p><p>in satisfaction of the king’s vengeance.” </p><p> The herald’s trumpet was drowned out</p><p>by a prolonged howl of hate and fury from </p><p>tire grimly waiting men in house-doors and </p><p>street-corners. Through their outcries </p><p>rang another trumpet, blown three times, </p><p>from without the wall. A cloud of dust, </p><p>through which came the gleam of lance- </p><p>points, bore down on the city gate. Out </p><p>from the nearest houses came rushing a </p><p>throng of townsmen, who had been waiting </p><p>for this moment and signal. Before the </p><p>startled Jamieson and his twenty could </p><p>turn and strike a blow, they were over- </p><p>powered and the gate-house captured. </p><p>’Round whirled the windlasses, down </p><p>dropped the drawbridge, up creaked the </p><p>portcullis, and open flew the gates of </p><p>Kinlochan. </p><p> With thunder of hoofs and jangle of mail,</p><p>two hundred horse swept through the city </p><p>gate. Boot to boot they rode, in column </p><p>of fours, with lances in rest. Over their </p><p>armor they wore black tabards; at their </p><p>head rode Evan the Outlaw, his face </p><p>concealed by the bars of his vizor. At </p><p>the sight of him, the jubilant townsmen </p><p>burst forth from doors, streets and alleys, </p><p>brandishing swords, pikes and Lochaber</p><p>axes. </p><p> Black David, his face cold and stern,</p><p>signaled to his herald, who blew loudly, </p><p>just as the combined forces of the citizens </p><p>and outlaws poured into the side of the </p><p>square opposite the cathedral and the </p><p>gallows. Thinking this the sign of sur- </p><p>render, the people stopped and listened </p><p>eagerly. </p><p> “As an example to all traitors, let Ronald</p><p>Cospatrick and his accomplices be hanged </p><p>at once!” cried the earl. </p><p> The townsmen stared at each other</p><p>The Devil’s Dagger </p><p>177 </p><p>aghast for a single moment; then frenzy </p><p>seized them, and they surged toward the </p><p>scaffold. Evan the Headless waved to </p><p>his outlaws, who were wheeling into line; </p><p>down came the lance-points, couched for the </p><p>charge. The Earl of Ross roared an order, </p><p>his archers bent their bows, the men-at-arms </p><p>locked shields and formed an unbroken </p><p>hedge of spears. The hangman placed the </p><p>noose ’round Ronald Cospatrick’s neck. </p><p> “Hold! Stay the execution! Here is the</p><p>murderer!” A voice rang clear and high </p><p>through the startled square. </p><p> Duncan Mclvor burst through the ragged</p><p>disarray of the townsmen, half-dragging a </p><p>little, dark man with frightened eyes, who </p><p>held in one hand something large and </p><p>cumbrous, wrapped in green cloth. In the </p><p>other hand, held high over his head by </p><p>Duncan’s iron fingers round his wrist, he </p><p>clutched a strangely shaped knife for all </p><p>to see. </p><p> “The devil’s dagger!” cried a hundred</p><p>voices among the townsmen. • “And look, </p><p>the outlander has its fellow in his girdle!” </p><p> “Heed him not—it is but a trick of the</p><p>king’s men!” shouted Evan the Headless. </p><p>“On—on, and save your provost!” </p><p> But the men of Kinlochan were now</p><p>beginning to feel that their provost was </p><p>saved already, without any need of their </p><p>risking their own necks. They saw the </p><p>deputy sign to the hangman to wait, and </p><p>to the captain to bring his prisoner nearer. </p><p>They looked at the troops, standing there </p><p>so steady and silent—and instinctively </p><p>they stood and grew silent themselves. </p><p>They would not charge, and without them, </p><p>Evan dared not. </p><p> Had he done so, had he hurled his two</p><p>hundred wild riders across the square, he </p><p>would certainly have trampled Duncan </p><p>and his prisoner to death, and perhaps have </p><p>broken the shield wall and won the day. </p><p>No one there knew this better than the </p><p>king’s deputy, yet, for all the notice Black </p><p>David took of Evan and his band, the </p><p>outlaws might have been a week’s ride </p><p>away. And that, if Evan had but known</p><p>Black David better, was a bad sign. </p><p> “Captain Mclvor,” he said to Duncan</p><p>sternly, “where have you been this long </p><p>time, and who is this fellow you bring </p><p>before me?” </p><p> “One whom I met up with on the roof of</p><p>yonder tall house last night,” answered </p><p>Duncan, gravely. “He was there for the </p><p>12 </p><p>purpose of putting one of those strange </p><p>daggers of his into me, as he did into Sir </p><p>Hugh Kennedy. But, being closer than </p><p>he thought, I took him by the neck and </p><p>held him over the edge of the roof till he </p><p>confessed all. Then, there being no other </p><p>way off the roof, I had him take me to his </p><p>room—-a secret room, which has a little </p><p>round window or loophole most cunningly </p><p>concealed among the carved stonework </p><p>across the front of the house. There I </p><p>waited till those others in the house, who </p><p>would not have let me depart alive, rushed </p><p>out into the street but now.” </p><p> “What is your name?” Black David</p><p>demanded, but the accused made no reply. </p><p> “Ridolfo is his name—he is a native of</p><p>Genoa,” said Duncan, the other nodding </p><p>assent. “Your lordship can speak with him </p><p>in French, as I did, for he knows no </p><p>Scottish.” </p><p> “Do you confess to the murder of the</p><p>king’s justiciar?” Black David asked, in </p><p>halting French, and received a calm affirm- </p><p>ative. </p><p> “Being an outlander, you had no quarrel</p><p>with the dead man,” Black David pursued. </p><p>“Who suborned you to do it?” </p><p> Now with the gallows before him, the</p><p>Italian instinctively looked for help to the </p><p>source from which he had often received it </p><p>before. He looked full at Evan, eyes be- </p><p>seeching the outlaw to rescue him. But </p><p>Evan, fearful that the man would betray </p><p>him, and glad of a chance to save his own </p><p>face and retire with some show of dignity, </p><p>cried out loudly: </p><p> “If yon outlander is the murderer, hang</p><p>him and be done! I came here to see </p><p>justice! Hang him!”</p><p> Ridolfo guessed the answer from his</p><p>master’s tone, and his dark eyes sparkled </p><p>with hate. </p><p> “Wait!” Duncan protested. “If it please</p><p>your lordship, let the man show how the </p><p>murder was done.” </p><p> “Show!” Black David commanded.</p><p>Removing the cloth from his burden, </p><p>Ridolfo displayed a short, thick steel bow </p><p>set in a heavy stock, to which a small wind- </p><p>lass was attached near the grip. At the </p><p>fore-end was a steel stirrup; this Ridolfo </p><p>planted on the ground, placed one foot in </p><p>it, and with both hands revolved the cranks </p><p>that drew back the string to where it was </p><p>caught and held by a trigger. Then setting </p><p>the blunt rough pommel of the dagger to </p><p>178 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the drawn string, as if it were a bolt or </p><p>arrow, the Italian held up to the gaze of </p><p>deputy and people—a Genoese cross-bow, </p><p>the first ever seen or heard of in Scotland. </p><p>Thus holding it, with Duncan’s arm over </p><p>his hand to prevent treachery, he whispered </p><p>in Duncan’s ear; and Duncan said softly </p><p>to the earl: </p><p> “It was Evan the Outlaw who ordered the</p><p>crime. I beg your Grace to grant this man </p><p>his life; he has dealt faithfully with me.” </p><p>With a cold smile, Black David nodded, </p><p>touched Ridolfo’s arm, and pointed to Evan </p><p>the Headless, whose horsemen were now </p><p>commencing a steady and well-ordered </p><p>retreat, secure in the knowledge that Black </p><p>David had but ten mounted men-at-arms, </p><p>and that he would be loth to risk loosing </p><p>a volley of arrows across the crowded square, </p><p>while the temper of the townsmen was still </p><p>uncertain. For heavy-armed infantry to </p><p>pursue and overtake retreating cavalry was, </p><p>of course, impossible. </p><p> As the earl pointed, Ridolfo understood,</p><p>and so did Evan. Fear clutched at his </p><p>heart; with a wild cry he clapped spurs to </p><p>his horse, even as Ridolfo took aim and shot. </p><p>The dagger, cleaving two hundred feet of </p><p>space too fast for eye to follow, struck the </p><p>rider full between the shoulders with a </p><p>sound like the blow of an ax. The dreaded </p><p>outlaw fell from his horse, and sprawled </p><p>on the pavement. In wild disarray, his </p><p>followers spurred their horses into a gallop </p><p>and plunged, colliding and hurtling each </p><p>other to the ground, for the city gate and </p><p>through it. </p><p> “Go you,” said Black David to a soldier,</p><p>“and unlace his helmet.” </p><p> The man obeyed; cutting the laces, he</p><p>plucked off the steel head-piece, and held </p><p>the dead man’s head so that all could see </p><p>his face. A loud shout of stupefaction rose </p><p>from all parts of the square. Evan the </p><p>Headless was Malcolm Carmichael! </p><p> Signing for silence, Black David ad-</p><p>dressed the people: </p><p> “Justice is done,” he said. “I restore</p><p>Ronald Cospatrick to all his honors and</p><p>offices, and I give freedom to his fellow </p><p>officers. Some of them may have been a </p><p>thought disloyal; but he who misled them </p><p>is punished, and I pardon them. Ridolfo </p><p>the Italian is free to go and come where </p><p>he likes, so long as he does not remain in </p><p>Scotland. As for Duncan Mclvor, who </p><p>found the murderer and solved the vexed </p><p>matter of the devil’s dagger, I can promise </p><p>him an ample reward at the king’s hands. </p><p>Henderson, strike off the prisoners’ chains, </p><p>and then go see how Jamieson and his </p><p>fellows fare at the gate. Mclvor will come </p><p>back to Scone with me and tell the regent </p><p>how he unearthed this business.” </p><p> The townsfolk cheered themselves hoarse,</p><p>tossing their caps in the air. They rushed </p><p>toward Duncan, loading him with praise </p><p>and admiration. But Duncan burst from </p><p>them and ran to the scaffold, where Mar- </p><p>garet Cospatrick lay sobbing on the rough </p><p>planks, clasping her father’s knees. Ten- </p><p>derly, Duncan raised her up; she turned, </p><p>looked into his eyes, and threw her arms </p><p>about him. </p><p>IN DEFEAT </p><p> BY MARX G.

This second letter, </p><p>also dealing with Western old-timers, is </p><p>self-explanatory. I leave in the part about </p><p>our movement for good citizenship; it serves </p><p>as sample of the magnificent response to the </p><p>call to good Americans—the response that </p><p>assures the practical success of the Ameri- </p><p>can League for Citizenship. </p><p>Clarksdale, Miss. </p><p> Concerning my letter in your first March issue I</p><p>wish to correct a mistake. It was A. T. Boger (not </p><p>Boyer) that was appointed sheriff of Wilbarger Co., </p><p>Texas, when Tom Stewart was ousted. I am sorry </p><p>I am such a poor scribe; some one will pick me up on </p><p>that sure. That is why I hasten to correct it. </p><p> 1 read with pleasure D. Wiggins’ letter, especially</p><p>that part about Chalk Bteson, Bill Hart and the </p><p>single-action Colt. By the way, that was the only </p><p>kind of a revolver to be found in the West in an early </p><p>day. If I see Bill advertised I will sure drop in and </p><p>see that old Colt. May be it won’t be the first time </p><p>I’ve seen it. </p><p> The best thing I have read in Adventure or any</p><p>place else is “a creed for Americans.” That is fine. </p><p>All we need is to get enough people educated along </p><p>these lines and we can do the thing we want to do— </p><p>build a good house out of good bricks—“Peas </p><p>River.” </p><p>FROM Thomas E. Webb of Camden, </p><p>Arkansas, comes the suggestion of a </p><p>monument in New York to the memory of </p><p>Jack London. “What if old Jack could </p><p>but look back and behold in the presence </p><p>of a huge marble the esteem in which he </p><p>was held,” writes Mr. Webb. “There’s </p><p>not an adventure-loving man in all America, </p><p>England or where not but would contribute </p><p>his share toward such a monument.” </p><p> That seems to me a good idea. How do</p><p>the rest of you feel about it? If a guar- </p><p>anteed committee of some kind were formed </p><p>I dare say the money would come in freely. </p><p>Personally I’m already carrying all the work </p><p>I can tote—more, I judge, from what it did </p><p>to me the first few months of 1918—but </p><p>perhaps Adventure could, if desired, serve </p><p>as a repository for contributions, our re- </p><p>sponsibility ceasing when the total was paid </p><p>over to the committee. </p><p>WHAT kind of monument? I should </p><p>say something simple and solid. How </p><p>much money should be collected? Where </p><p>should it be placed? What inscription? </p><p> I do not know Mr. Webb personally, but</p><p>perhaps it would be the best plan for all </p><p>interested to write to him and shape up a </p><p>definite course of action. There ought to </p><p>be a monument to Jack London and from </p><p>whom could it come more fittingly than </p><p>from the adventurers who gather about the </p><p>Camp-Fire from all over the world? </p><p>A LETTER from one of our American </p><p>comrades with the Canadians in Eng- </p><p>land. At the end of it was a postscript, </p><p>which has gone into “Lost Trails,” inquir- </p><p>ing for Richard Granville, “Linderfeldt,” </p><p>“Captain King,” “Lea,” “Dad Biddle” and </p><p>the rest of the “American Legion” that </p><p>was in Mexico. </p><p>Salt Pons, </p><p>Sandwitch, Kent, England. </p><p> There are many Yanks in this camp, from Maine</p><p>to California, We wear the Canadian uniform </p><p>mostly. Not a few are very homesick, yet as an </p><p>average they are doing their bit as men. Many of </p><p>them are holding some office as N. C. O. and some </p><p>have commissions as lieutenants and captains. We </p><p>have enough to eat and good quarters, as soldiering </p><p>goes—better than I had in Mexico under Villa or </p><p>Madcro—and no fighting yet. Plenty of amuse- </p><p>ments. Wet and dry canteens, cinemas or movies, </p><p>concerts, as there is some splendid talent in the </p><p>ranks. But I miss my “Java”; here it is tea or </p><p>cocoa. </p><p>AND what a medley of dialects, Scots, Irish, </p><p>Welsh, English of several varieties, Yanks from </p><p>Massachusetts, Michigan, Texas, Colorado, Cali- </p><p>fornia, Australians and negroes. This is a study in </p><p>i8o </p><p>Adventure </p><p>sociology or hobo-ology; any way it’s interesting. </p><p>Especially when I enter the dining-hut to hear a </p><p>Welsh orderly say, “Two more mans up this way.” </p><p>And if you were lo be transported to our sleeping </p><p>quarters about nine p.m. and woke up you would </p><p>wonder if you had fallen into a “Nut Factory” and </p><p>whether they used chloroform on the poor things. </p><p> But they are a fairly good-natured bunch. I</p><p>have many warm friends among both men and </p><p>officers, and expect a raise in rank soon. I am win- </p><p>ning it here as well as in Mexico, Honduras, the </p><p>U. S.

Lots of red </p><p>tape, savvy? </p><p>T AM full of real news and copy but no use writing </p><p>it to be torpedoed by the censor, but I can tell </p><p>you something about the country. Its quaint old </p><p>houses with tile and thatched roofs, old wind-mills, </p><p>castles, with walls twenty feet thick—they all look </p><p>like oil paintings—and canals, tall bridges, large </p><p>pasture-lands filled with sheep, and they are in good </p><p>condition as the Winter has been mild. I was out </p><p>and picked some wild daisies to-day and was boating </p><p>on the river—no, not joy-riding, just a part of my </p><p>duty, in the “Salvage Corps” of which I am the </p><p>originator. The women and girls of England are </p><p>sure doing their bit in this war. Will tell you about </p><p>them some other time. I am disgracefully healthy. </p><p>So long.—“Powder Jess.” </p><p>A WOMAN comrade of our writer’s bri- </p><p>gade. They are few and far between </p><p>but always assured of friendly welcome. </p><p>Greeting to Louise Rice, who gives us a story </p><p>for the first time and introduces herself </p><p>according to Camp-Fire custom: </p><p> This matter of discussing myself bothers me a</p><p>little. I’ve never done any self-exploiting, nor al- </p><p>lowed any one else to do it for me. However, I guess </p><p>there really is an excuse for it in this case, if I am to </p><p>be admitted to Adventure’s family, for if I write </p><p>about thugs and bums and longshoremen and </p><p>tramps, etc., as I’m likely to do, some of your men </p><p>readers will be wondering how on earth I know any- </p><p>thing about what I’m writing about. </p><p>T THINK a little story will illustrate how I happen </p><p>to know more about the rough life of the world </p><p>than the majority of women. I was coming home </p><p>from the opera one night and, as it was unusually </p><p>mild, my escort and myself started to walk home </p><p>through Madison Square Park. Coming the other</p><p>way, from tending his boilers in a well known build- </p><p>ing on Twenty-third Street, came an acquaintance of </p><p>mine. I would gladly have evaded him, but he </p><p>planted himself before me, looked me up and down </p><p>and inquired, in amazement: </p><p> “Fer th’ love o’ Mike, Lou, where’d yuh get them</p><p>glad rags?” </p><p>T-IE KNEW me merely as a rather dingy person </p><p>who had chatted with him, off and on, for a </p><p>year, as he stood taking the air at his cellar steps, </p><p>and, owing to a chance word of mine about running a </p><p>typewriter, he had always taken it for granted that </p><p>I was an underpaid and overworked stenographer. </p><p>Be it recorded to his glory, and to the everlasting </p><p>honor of what are known as “rough” men, that I </p><p>have repeatedly made friends with them in just that </p><p>way, and have yet to receive from one of them a </p><p>word which would shame the finest so-called </p><p>gentleman in the land. </p><p> I did not want this particular friend to see me in</p><p>the “glad rags,” because I did not want him to think </p><p>that I had been anything but the real friend that I </p><p>really was. So I had to explain, and, alas, I never </p><p>got another entirely frank and unconscious word out </p><p>of him! But thanks to my acquaintance of the </p><p>previous year with him, I know, intimately and in </p><p>detail, just what a man like him thinks and wants— </p><p>and I believe I could tend his boilers, too. </p><p>TN FACT, I’ve known about every kind of man </p><p> and a woman that there is, I guess. I’ve been a</p><p>reporter, and a “rewrite” woman, and worked in a </p><p>big advertising office, and in a motion picture </p><p>“exchange” and run a restaurant and had a mani- </p><p>cure shop, and got five dollars an hour for doing </p><p>massage, and a dollar and a half an hour for running </p><p>a gymnasium, where I had every sort of person, </p><p>from kids of fourteen to old men of sixty, from shop- </p><p>girls to society women. I’m really a pretty good </p><p>farmer, and a well known graphologist (give you </p><p>three guesses as to what that is!) and I love to cook </p><p>and hate to sew, and if I’ve got a clean collar and cuffs </p><p>on I think I’m dressed up enough to go anywhere. </p><p> I’m older than you’d think, and I can walk</p><p>twenty miles, easy, and put my knuckles to the floor </p><p>without bending my knees. Selah!—Louise Rice. </p><p> P. S. I forgot to tell you about the characters in</p><p>“Skirts and Brats.” All of them are real, and the </p><p>story is mainly so. The names are correct. Red </p><p>Jumbo, Smoky Mike, Blond Maggie, Chicago Bessie </p><p>and Larry the Dip will probably be recognized if any</p><p>of their old pals read the tale. Jumbo married </p><p>Chicago Bessie, of course, and is the devoted step- </p><p>daddy to the twins. Larry, brave fellow, died in </p><p>trying to conquer his habit. There’s rather a pa- </p><p>thetic story about him which I may write, some </p><p>time. I don’t know what became of Blond Maggie, </p><p>but I do know that she started out to earn her living </p><p>in an honest way. The McGurk’s where Jumbo lay </p><p>up, in New York, waiting for his beard to grow, was </p><p>the famous McGurk’s, one of the best-known hang- </p><p>outs of criminals in this country. On several occa- </p><p>sions myself and an escort spent a long evening in </p><p>that dreadful place, successfully impersonating ha- </p><p>bitues, and gathering all sorts of impressions, data </p><p>and information about the underworld. </p><p>nPRAT was in the days when New York was </p><p>“wide open.” I spent nearly all of one year </p><p>investigating the conditions of the lower East Side, </p><p>for I could not believe that the stories which the </p><p>newspapers were just beginning to print about it </p><p>were true. I investigated, as long as I could stand </p><p>it, and had to conclude that the half had not been </p><p>even whispered. </p><p> And let me add just one word. You see a lot</p><p>written about the “adventurous” life of criminals, </p><p>about their “orgies” and their generally gay and </p><p>daring lives. Well, believe me, the most dismal, </p><p>gloomy, carc-ridden people I have ever seen in my </p><p>not exactly narrow life have been criminals. When </p><p>they drink they fight, instead of singing. When </p><p>they don’t drink they fall into such depths of abys- </p><p>mal misery that even the worst of them would </p><p>arouse pity. From which you can easily deduce </p><p>any number of morals! </p><p>The Camp-Fire	181</p><p> But in the above Miss Rice told so little</p><p>of her real adventures that I wrote and pro- </p><p>tested. So she added what follows. But, </p><p>even so, she hasn’t really done justice to a </p><p>life of adventures that would make many of </p><p>the men look to their laurels. However, </p><p>here’s the bit more: </p><p> I have been out of town, which is the reason why I</p><p>have not answered your request for more dope about </p><p>what I thought I’d said more than enough about. I </p><p>didn’t mention the fact that I really can and have </p><p>run an engine because that wasn’t much of an adven- </p><p>ture—a sewing-machine is more complicated! Any </p><p>dub can do it. </p><p>T DIDN’T mention about roaming around with </p><p> my friends, the Romanys, because that isn’t</p><p>much of an adventure, either. The safest place I </p><p>know of for man or beast is a Gipsy wagon—also, </p><p>you get splendiferous eats, and the roof is hail- </p><p>proof, and the talk is beautifully absent. However, </p><p>if you think it interesting to say to the readers </p><p>of Adventure that I’ve done those things, go </p><p>right ahead. As an adventure, I have found mak- </p><p>ing my living in New York by far the most ex- </p><p>citing and hazardous undertaking I have ever </p><p>attempted. </p><p> The Gipsies are really wonderfully interesting</p><p>people, but they are not the murdering, knife-out, </p><p>stealing, “wild” people of the usual fiction; not a-tall </p><p>—which is the reason why editors uniformly refuse </p><p>my stories about them! </p><p>T THOUGHT it was rather an adventure to shingle </p><p> a house of mine, once—there was not the slight-</p><p>est danger in sitting on the ridge pole, but the bat- </p><p>tery of long range glances which poured upon me </p><p>while I sat there was one of the most trying dangers </p><p>I ever endured. I like to plow and harrow, too, </p><p>which drew an interested ring of onlookers for </p><p>several days of one radiant Spring. But my most </p><p>unusual feat was to carry a new broom down three </p><p>blocks of theatrical Broadway one day. It was not </p><p>a stunt—a friend of mine, who had just rented a </p><p>studio really needed it—but you would have thought </p><p>that the Wild Man of Borneo Had Just Come To </p><p>Town. Things like that leave me utterly be- </p><p>wildered. Why do so many people in this very </p><p>interesting and natural world connive to make </p><p>simple and natural actions so difficult? But that’s </p><p>nothing to do with me or this adventurous life of </p><p>mine that you insist on, has it? </p><p>T COUNT as the really wonderful adventures of </p><p>1 my life the many, many unusual and wonderful </p><p>people whom I have met—not necessarily well </p><p>known people, although there are a good many of </p><p>them, but the rare human types, the man or woman </p><p>who has been and gone and done things, and couldn’t </p><p>write a word about them to save their necks! If I ever </p><p>write any good stories I’ll deserve no credit. It will </p><p>just be a rehash of what those big people have done. </p><p>Come to think of it, I guess my friendships are </p><p>my true excuses for cumbering this already over- </p><p>populated earth—I’m a sort of licensed singer, </p><p>like those bards of old who earned their board </p><p>and room by reciting the deeds of those more </p><p>worthy than themselves, and far, far greater— </p><p>Louise Rice. </p><p>/'-'VRDER of the Restless. Wayne Eber- </p><p>ley, its secretary, asks to have it bul- </p><p>letined that, because of the lotig interval </p><p>between the announcement of the formation </p><p>of the society and the date on which con- </p><p>stitution and blanks were finally ready, </p><p>nearly half of the letters he mailed out to </p><p>inquirers were returned by the post-office. </p><p>Quite plainly the inquirers are entitled to </p><p>be ranked among the Restless, since an </p><p>address reaches them for so short a time. </p><p>If those who thus missed their replies from </p><p>Mr. Eberley will write him again, giving </p><p>their present addresses, he will be glad to </p><p>write again in his turn.

In newspaper parlance, there </p><p>was “no story.”—E. S. Pladwell. </p><p>AN INQUIRY from our comrade E. A. </p><p>- Brininstool concerning Captain Dran- </p><p>nan: </p><p> If there is any old Army officer who saw Indian</p><p>fighting on the plains anywhere from 1860 to 1886,</p><p>or who took part in the Apache wars or the Modoc </p><p>war, or who knows the particulars of the rescue of </p><p>the Oatman girls from Apaches, I would like to ask </p><p>if he ever heard of a man named Captain Wm. F. </p><p>Drannan, author of a book entitled “Thirty-One </p><p>Years on the Plains.” Drannan’s photo, the front- </p><p>ispiece of the book, shows an old man about seventy- </p><p>five, in a buckskin suit, and is signed by himself as </p><p>“Chief of Scouts.” </p><p>T~)RANNAN alleges he was raised by the cele- </p><p>brated Kit Carson,'and that he was later a com- </p><p>panion of old Jim Bridger, Jim Beckwourth, “Buf- </p><p>falo Bill” and other frontier celebrities. I went </p><p>carefully through the book and counted the number </p><p>of Indians alleged to have been slain either by him </p><p>in person or killed by companion “scouts” and him- </p><p>self, or by troops for whom he scouted, and his own </p><p>figures give the astounding number of 609 redskins. </p><p>The book has 586 pages.

He has stud- </p><p>ied the American Indian for years and his </p><p>tales not only bring vividly before our eyes </p><p>the early years of our country’s history but </p><p>can be relied upon for accuracy in both de- </p><p>tail and spirit. They make the Indian and </p><p>pioneer of the past a living reality. </p><p> I find I’m breaking rules and praising at</p><p>Camp-Fire some of our own stories, but per- </p><p>haps you’ll make allowance for the fact that </p><p>I’m speaking of them not because of their </p><p>fiction value but because they are doing </p><p>exactly what some of you (I’m glad to say) </p><p>arc doing—telling us facts about the days of </p><p>the frontier that has moved westward across </p><p>our country three thousand miles in three </p><p>hundred years. </p><p>ANOTHER story in this issue, “The </p><p>■ Devil’s Dagger,” performs a similar </p><p>service as to the Scotland of the old days. I </p><p>like these stories of old times mixed in with </p><p>those of the present day and, judging from </p><p>your letters and talks, most of you feel the </p><p>same way. But they must be dependable in </p><p>fact and atmosphere or the value and in- </p><p>terest are greatly lessened. Comrades Bish- </p><p>op and Brodeur, like Comrade Pendexter, </p><p>know whereof they write. Both have for </p><p>years been students of past civilizations, and</p><p>Mr. Brodeur—well, he reads the old sagas </p><p>in the original and little things like that. </p><p> Now here’s a little “dope on the side”</p><p>from Mr. Pendexter on his story in this </p><p>issue: </p><p> Norway, Maine</p><p>The story was suggested by the sacred myth of the </p><p>Cherokee concerning the Raven Mocker, which, </p><p>according to James Moony in his authoritative work </p><p>on Cherokee mythology, was the most dreaded of </p><p>all wizards and demons. The Cherokee firmly be- </p><p>lieved in the Raven Mocker. Once when Mr. </p><p>Moony was among the Cherokee he says (page 501, </p><p>“Myths of the Cherokee”) “A sick man was allowed </p><p>to die alone because his friends imagined they felt </p><p>the presence of the Raven Mocker.” The same </p><p>authority says, “The grewsome belief in The Raven </p><p>Mocker is universal among the Cherokee and has </p><p>close parallel in other tribes.” And he cites as an </p><p>example the Iroquois belief in the “cannibal ghost.” </p><p>AS THE time of this story is about 1730, or after </p><p>the Shawneee had been driven to the Ohio, the </p><p>superstitious fears of the white traders are plausible. </p><p>The execution of witches in New England was less </p><p>than forty years away. In speaking of another </p><p>myth of the Cherokee, Mr. Moony says, “The faith </p><p>in the existence of the miraculous Littie Deer is </p><p>almost as strong and universal to-day (1897-98 ed. </p><p>“Myths of the Cherokee”) among the older Chero- </p><p>kee as is the belief in a future life.” On commenting </p><p>on the talismanic power attached to the conse- </p><p>crated down of the young antler of the deer the same </p><p>author remarks: “So firm was the belief that it had </p><p>influence over ‘anything about a deer’ that eighty or </p><p>a hundred years ago even white traders used to bar- </p><p>gain with the Indians for such charms in order to in- </p><p>crease their store of deerskins by drawing trade to </p><p>themselves.” I cite this to prove readiness of </p><p>whites to accept Indian beliefs. </p><p> The raven “dives” while flying by folding one</p><p>wing close to the body, falling and, says Moony, </p><p>“apparently turning a somersault.” The cry given </p><p>at such times is described as being entirely different </p><p>from the ordinary cry of the raven. </p><p>'T'HE old stage route between Knoxville and </p><p>Harper’s Ferry practically followed the Great </p><p>Indian War Trail. The Cherokee and other In- </p><p>dians generally believed they would become what </p><p>they ate. </p><p> Usunhiyi—“where it is always growing dark,” is</p><p>used in myths and sacred formulas to denote the</p><p>West. The land of the dead, or “Ghost Country,” </p><p>is situated in Usunhiyi. It is called Tsusginai. </p><p>The common word for west is wudeligunyi—“there </p><p>where it (the sun) goes down.” </p><p> It is told by the Cherokee that in 1747 two Mo-</p><p>hawks killed more than twenty in stealthy attacks </p><p>on the Lower Towns. During the Spring and </p><p>Summer their adroit ambuscades caused the Chero- </p><p>kee to believe they were wizards or witches—Hugh </p><p>Pendexter. </p><p>SOME time ago we had a letter from our </p><p>comrade W. E. Brandon telling his </p><p>experiences in a Central-American earth- </p><p>quake. Here is one written nearly a year </p><p>ago, telling about the unique job of build- </p><p>ing a railroad on hot lava, and a third dated </p><p>in 1918. These letters were written to our </p><p>comrade W. C. Tuttle, whose stories are </p><p>part of our regular diet—this friendship </p><p>between a man in San Salvador and an- </p><p>other in Spokane who have never seen each </p><p>other being another sample of the personal </p><p>The Camp-Fire	183</p><p>friendships growing up through our Camp- </p><p>Fire. </p><p> La Lava, Kilometro 69-72, Salvador, C. A.</p><p> Dear Friend Tuttle Your very welcome and</p><p>interesting letter came in yesterday. I will try to </p><p>make this a connected letter, old-timer, but can’t say </p><p>that I shall. I ate a lot of cucumbers yesterday and </p><p>for a wonder that old stomach of mine reniged. I </p><p>can generally eat anything that is too thick to drink, </p><p>or drink anything that is too thin to eat. But this </p><p>time it failed. I got a “tummy-ache” and then </p><p>thought I would cure it by taking a good shot of </p><p>“hootch.” I don’t yet know if it was the cucumber </p><p>salad or the hootch that put me on the blink, but </p><p>naiurally I lay it to the former. Anyway, I hap- </p><p>pened to be down at a town named Sonsonate </p><p>(pretty nearly like Cincinnati, eh?), and was staying </p><p>at a hotel. 1 sure passed a hi-yu night of it; griping </p><p>with what resembled a cross between a baby </p><p>with the colic and a full-grown hombre with the </p><p>ptomaine poison. But I dug myself out in time for </p><p>the first train this morning and arrived here on the </p><p>job and found out that one of my engineers had </p><p>stolen my hand-car last night and had taken a </p><p>bunch to a nearby town and got them all hi-yu </p><p>dnink and they had a fight with machetes on the </p><p>way back and disabled several, and what was worse, </p><p>broke my hand-car. Oh, this life in the tropics is </p><p>M OVV, I’ll go back to the start and tell you the </p><p>news: I think I told you that after I had vol- </p><p>unteered for relief work and had done quite a bit of </p><p>that, after the earthquake, I felt the pressing need </p><p>of a few simoleons. About that time the Red Cross </p><p>asked me to construct their building for them at my </p><p>own price. 1 told them that I had no money to offer </p><p>for Red Cross work but that if they would buy the </p><p>material and pay for the labor I would do the con- </p><p>struction for them, donating my work instead of </p><p>money. As the officers of the Red Cross knew that </p><p>I was broke they mentioned this offer frequently, so </p><p>I got quite a rep. </p><p> Then I began to get offers at good prices in con-</p><p>struction work. I started in that business and took </p><p>in a partner who had almost as much money as I </p><p>had, but who was a good hustler. I began to make </p><p>money. But I had to work, old top. I worked lit- </p><p>erally day and night. Many a night I spent ma- </p><p>king elevations and setting my blue prints for the </p><p>morning sun, and then spent the entire day in man- </p><p>aging my gangs of men and wondering where I </p><p>would land the money for the pay-roll that week. </p><p>But I got the reputation and the business. I en- </p><p>close one of my cards.</p><p>^UHILE I was at this business, the railway whose </p><p>letter-heads I am now using, ’phoned me and </p><p>asked me to come down to see them. I replied that </p><p>I was too busy. The general manager then came </p><p>down to see me and wanted me to take charge of a </p><p>certain job for them. I told them that as it would </p><p>take me out of the city I could not do the work for </p><p>them—if they could get any one else. They tried </p><p>and then they asked me to at least go down and see </p><p>the work and give them a report on what I thought </p><p>of it, they to pay any sum that I demanded for my </p><p>time so consumed and all expenses for the trip. I </p><p>agreed to that if the trip would not occupy more </p><p>than three days of my time. </p><p>AND here was the job: When the volcano broke </p><p>loose it opened several new craters. An im- </p><p>mense flow of lava from one of these ran down and </p><p>covered a portion of the railroad about a mile and </p><p>a half long to a depth of from eighteen to thirty feet </p><p>of hot lava. The right-of-way troubles, etc.,' allow </p><p>them to occupy only their old right of way. In </p><p>other words, the job was to build a railroad over hot </p><p>lava—a stunt never before pulled off in the history </p><p>of mankind. Well, I have never seen a job that </p><p>scared me. I walked across the lava, over the pro- </p><p>posed route. I smothered in sulfur fumes, I ran </p><p>over white-hot rocks, and sprinted through blue </p><p>flames. I felt the crust give under my feet and </p><p>jumped for other points which also gave way—for </p><p>all I knew into an infemo of molten rock below. </p><p>But I went back and told them the road could be </p><p>put across in three months. They then wanted to </p><p>know if I would take the job. I told them I would </p><p>not, on contract, but that I would do it for them if </p><p>they would pay all expenses and for my superinten- </p><p>dence would pay me a certain sum per week. </p><p>They snapped at it. So there you are; I’m the en- </p><p>gineer in charge of this work, and am making good. </p><p>Instead of getting across in three months, I will </p><p>make it in between six and seven weeks. </p><p>f)ID you ever see lava? Hot lava, especially? </p><p> It does not look like I had supposed. When it</p><p>first comes from the crater it appears to be a mass of </p><p>flames. At that time it is, of course, in a molten </p><p>state. But it partially solidifies rapidly. Then the </p><p>pressure behind breaks up this partially solid rock </p><p>and rolls and tumbles it forward in a rugged mass </p><p>which might be likened to a badly plowed field of </p><p>some mythological giant. Portions stay boiling and </p><p>spout out flames and sulfurous smoke, like miniature </p><p>volcanoes. Other parts partly cool, but have no </p><p>grain like natural rock or granite. </p><p>T HAVE had my troubles. No one knew any-</p><p>thing about such a job. I had to go it blindly. </p><p>The only way I have succeeded is because I know </p><p>how to work the people. I know their language, </p><p>their viewpoint, the arguments that get under their </p><p>skin, I know when to be severe with them, and when </p><p>to treat them in a patriarchal, or better said, a feudal </p><p>manner. In other words, I get harmony of action </p><p>from the five to six hundred laborers and thirty to </p><p>forty employees I am using. I will succeed. But </p><p>the troubles have been many. I have run across </p><p>rock so hard that it would turn the finest chisels; </p><p>it was so hot I could not use dynamite. It would </p><p>burn up before even the shortest possible fuse </p><p>could reach the cap. Using a chisel for fifteen or </p><p>twenty minutes, it would begin to glow dull red, </p><p>lose its temper, and double over under the blows like </p><p>a piece of iron just taken from the forge. The rock </p><p>was so hot that the men could stand on it for only a </p><p>short time per trick. At one time I had gangs </p><p>shoveling white-hot stone, their shovels wrapped in </p><p>blue flame, and the bed of lava thundering and </p><p>cracking under their feet. It is a job the like of </p><p>which will probably never be seen again. </p><p> Anyway, I have gotten the line over about half-</p><p>way already and when the general manager and his </p><p>staff came down last Saturday and looked it over </p><p>they told me they were more than satisfied and inti- </p><p>mated if I went ahead the way I was going that </p><p>there might be a substantial bonus in it for me at the </p><p>end. I wonder what will happen this time to break </p><p>Adventure </p><p>184 </p><p>me again? If I ever gel any money and live to </p><p>spend it, I think the shock will probably kill me. </p><p>W/ELL, that is enough of my vicissitudes. I was </p><p>tickled to bear that your honeymoon had </p><p>passed so gloriously, and I hope that the rest of </p><p>your lives will be only a continuation of the honey- </p><p>moon. I don’t blame you at all for raving a bit </p><p>over your wife. You have ample reason to do so. </p><p>If an ornery, sour-dough artist who admits beginning </p><p>to get bald-headed can get a wife like that, I wonder </p><p>what a good-looking fellow like myself might do? </p><p>And I can tell you, from experience, friend o’ mine, </p><p>you’ll never meet up with the good times in other </p><p>parts that you enjoy in your own teepee. I often </p><p>wish that my life had been laid in different lines, but </p><p>—well, there is no use bewailing the mandates of kis- </p><p>met. I am doomed, like the wandering Jew, to ktep </p><p>always on the move, and suppose I shall eventually </p><p>kick in, like a desert rat—with my shoes on (if I own </p><p>any) and glorying in the life I’ve led. even if repent- </p><p>ing the death I die. Anyway I know that when I do </p><p>kick in I will have LIVED. I’m a bit like the old- </p><p>timer who had soused up with hootch for years and </p><p>was finally told by the doctor that he would have to </p><p>quit drinking or go blind. His reply was: “YVal, </p><p>derncd ef I haint seen nigh all th’ world I want to </p><p>see, anyhow.” </p><p>I DON’T get much war news down here. I used </p><p> to when I was in the Legation, but here it is</p><p>scarce. I want to get into that scrap, but I’ve got </p><p>to get a few ducats together first for my two sons </p><p>in the States. From all indications I will have all </p><p>kinds of time to get into it yet. Although I am get- </p><p>ting past the age I did not think I would have </p><p>great trouble getting into it, for I believe I told you </p><p>that I am an ex-regular soldier from Spanish-Ameri- </p><p>can war times. In fact, I am a member of the Post </p><p>of Spanish-American War Veterans in Everett, </p><p>Washington, where I resided for a time a few years </p><p>ago. I think I told you about that, did I not? </p><p> Must end this for a time and do some work.</p><p> Here is the later letter:</p><p> January 8, 1918,</p><p>San Salvador, El Salvadore, C.

We hope you will be patient if tkeir answers are al </p><p>times delayed: Capt.-Adj. Joseph Mills Hanson; Capt. A. M. Lochwitzky. </p><p>Plantations and Trading in the South Seas </p><p> Question:—“I am interested in the South-Sea</p><p>Islands, but do not know an iota about the subject. </p><p>I would like to know how much money it would take </p><p>to go into the plantation business; how much profit </p><p>could be made based on capital invested, and what is </p><p>raised on the plantations? About trading. What </p><p>do you trade and for what do you trade it to the </p><p>natives? Can you give me a list of books or </p><p>pamphlets which I could get on the subject?”— </p><p>Charles Gavelda, Clarksburg, W. Va. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Mills:—Works that would be of</p><p>any practical help on the South Seas are scarce and </p><p>expensive, and are published in England. I can not </p><p>give you a list of books on the subject available in </p><p>U. S. A. Your public libraries might help in this </p><p>direction. After the war, if you apply to any of the </p><p>steamship lines trading into the South Seas they </p><p>will furnish you with guide-books which contain </p><p>some information. The censor restricts the issue </p><p>of such books, naturally, just now. </p><p> The amount of money needed to start as a planter</p><p>in the Islands is also one which I can not do justice </p><p>to. It is all a matter of personal equation—how </p><p>large your ambition may be and the strength of your </p><p>banking account. A man with money and enter- </p><p>prise and energy—and all are certainly needed in the </p><p>Islands—should certainly give the ground a good </p><p>look over before he invests. No earthly good taking </p><p>my word for it. Who am I that any man should </p><p>leave his home-land and invest his capital for me? </p><p> Almost anything can be raised in the Islands, but</p><p>—as you will see by some of the notes I have already </p><p>sent to the “Ask Adventure” pages—there are so </p><p>many groups, and all have their specialty, therefore </p><p>a definite direction upon your generalizing proposi- </p><p>tion is out of the question. If America and Austra- </p><p>lasia, plus Japan and Britain, insist that none of the </p><p>South-Sea Islands shall go back to Germany, then </p><p>we shall see great developments in the Islands. </p><p>Cotton, for instance, now almost unknown there, </p><p>will become a staple product. </p><p> At the present time the planters merely take off</p><p>the surface what bounteous Nature gives with al- </p><p>most no effort—copra (the kernel of the coconut, </p><p>from which a valuable soap-making oil is extracted), </p><p>bananas (which are shipped to Australia and New </p><p>Zealand), oranges. Rubber is a developing indus- </p><p>try. In Papua, which the Australians captured </p><p>from the Germans, gold has been found, and the </p><p>Australian Government is now prospecting for oil. </p><p> The Islands are on the Equator, therefore hot.</p><p>The natives generally are friendly toward the white </p><p>man; and native labor is employed on the planta- </p><p>tions. A good, well-kept plantation of any sort of </p><p>product is a profitable investment, but experience is </p><p>needed. If a man owned a small vessel he could </p><p>trade among the Islands, and buy from the natives </p><p>or planters. The difference between the planter </p><p>and the trader is that one grows and the other buys </p><p>for the outside market. </p><p>188 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Hunting and Fishing in Arizona </p><p> Question:—“I am planning a limited hunting trip</p><p>to the country lying north of Tucson, Arizona. </p><p>Being raised east of the Mississippi River am ignor- </p><p>ant of conditions outside of the Arizona cities. I </p><p>expect to leave home in a party of three or four with </p><p>a Winchester .22 repeating rifle for my own use. </p><p>We expect to go in a Ford touring car and be gone for </p><p>about two weeks. What kind of game will I find </p><p>and what kind may I expect to kill with a .22 caliber </p><p>rifle? What kind of game will the law allow me to </p><p>kill during the months of April, May, June, July </p><p>and August? What will a chcap but convenient </p><p>camping outfit cost a party of three or four and what </p><p>kind should we get? What kind of food should we </p><p>carry and how much? What precautions should we </p><p>take against animals and reptiles at night? What </p><p>would be the farthest point we may expect to reach </p><p>and return under ordinary conditions, traveling, </p><p>say, three hours a day? Where may game and fish </p><p>be found most plentiful in this region?”—H. B. </p><p>Robinson, Tucson, Arizona. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Harriman:—According to Arizona</p><p>law you are not to kill any game in April and May. </p><p>You can shoot doves and white wings after June 1st. </p><p>There you are, and a mighty small bag of game you </p><p>will get. </p><p> Get your camp-stuff prices where you are, as they</p><p>differ from Los Angeles prices. </p><p> Consult some of the old-timers in Tucson—there</p><p>are plenty of them—and your own appetite, plus the </p><p>food administration rules about what to take in the </p><p>way of grub. My habit has been to pack bacon, </p><p>flour, rice, sugar, salt, baking powder, canned toma- </p><p>toes and canned milk. </p><p> Personally, I would not expect to get any fishing</p><p>till after I had gone well north of Florence, in the </p><p>Gila Mountains. You have desert all the way from </p><p>Tucson to Florence and beyond. If I were in Tuc- </p><p>son and had a desire to fish and hunt, I would </p><p>chase up to Roosevelt Dam and fish in the reservoir </p><p>or Salt River or Tonto Creek. Trout season does </p><p>not begin till June first. Other fish September first. </p><p> All the protection I want against animals is to</p><p>have my gun handy. I don’t know what animals </p><p>would harm you, anyhow, since they are all far </p><p>more afraid of you than you are of them. As for </p><p>reptiles, a tent with canvas bottom sewed in and </p><p>turned up across entrance to height of ten inches, is</p><p>plenty. B. H. Dyas, 321-25 West 78th Street, Los </p><p>Angeles, sells a water-proof tanolite tent like that. </p><p>Write him for prices. </p><p> The distance you would travel in three hours, in a</p><p>Ford, is dependent on roads and accidents. Can’t </p><p>tell you that.^ </p><p>Maine Fishing </p><p> Question:—“Will you let me know the possibility</p><p>of bay and surf fishing either by casting or from a </p><p>small boat or motor-launch; kind of fishing to be </p><p>had, in what quantity they run, tackle necessary; </p><p>bungalows or cottages that may be rented or board </p><p>secured; weather conditions or clothes necessary; </p><p>transportation methods and costs; accessibility of </p><p>guides and their cost? Are licenses necessary for </p><p>salt-water fishing?”—Henry M. Goldstein, New </p><p>York City. </p><p> Answer, by Dr. Hathome:—I am not as well</p><p>posted on the bay and surf fishing on the coast of </p><p>Maine, as on the inland stream and lake fishing. </p><p>I think there is very little if any surf fishing, but </p><p>there'are plenty of fish to be had in the bays and off </p><p>the coast. </p><p> They catch great quantities of cod, haddock, pol-</p><p>lock, hake in the deep water, and in the bays, </p><p>flounders, cunners, mackerel, etc. </p><p> Several years ago I made a number of trips to</p><p>Small Point, which is situated some fifteen miles </p><p>below the city of Bath at the mouth of the Kenne- </p><p>bec River, for tautog fishing, or black fish, as some </p><p>call them. This was good sport, the best I think 1 </p><p>ever had for salt-water fishing. </p><p> There are plenty of cottages to be had, which can</p><p>be rented from one week to the whole season, and </p><p>the prices run from SI per day up. Board in pri- </p><p>vate families and hotels ranges from $7 per week </p><p>upwards. Fishing tackle may be had from any of </p><p>the small towns along the coast, and the outfit is not </p><p>expensive. </p><p> Launches and guides may be had at very reason-</p><p>able prices. </p><p> Transportation facilities are good, as most of the</p><p>resorts can be reached by railroad or steamship </p><p>lines. </p><p> Licenses are not required for salt-water fishing.</p><p>Trading in Central Africa</p><p> Question:—“Will you tell me what chances an ex-</p><p>army man has in the trading business in Central </p><p>Africa? I am in the Army at the present time, but </p><p>would like to hunt up something when I get out. I </p><p>am twenty-two years old and have had a little ex- </p><p>perience as trader in Mexico. I ran a small store </p><p>for the American Mining Syndicate two years in </p><p>N. W. Sonora. I have only a common school edu- </p><p>cation but a strong constitution. I am a good </p><p>photographer and can run a moving-picture camera. </p><p>Will you give me the address of a couple of the </p><p>trading companies that I could write to regarding a </p><p>position as sub-agent in one of the interior stations? </p><p>What would be the duties of a sub-agent?”—Sgt. E. </p><p>W. Moon, San Antonio, Texas. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Miller:—Write to: Niger Com-</p><p>pany, Surrey House, Victoria Embankment, Lon- </p><p>don, Eng.; Lever Brothers, Royal Lever Bldg. </p><p>Liverpool, Eng.

The pay is not attractive at first, </p><p>but a likely young fellow will come out all right. </p><p>Of course these companies are going to think twice </p><p>before they hire a stranger they have never seen, </p><p>and by far your best chance is to work passage to </p><p>Liverpool and go round the offices; write for ap- </p><p>pointment when in Liverpool. </p><p> Several of my correspondents, however, have, se-</p><p>cured jobs with above-named firms by simply writ- </p><p>ing. Conditions, however, will be very different </p><p>when the big armies are disbanded. There will be </p><p>many thousands looking for such berths. </p><p> The duties of a sub-agent cover such help as he</p><p>can give the agent in clearing the stem-wheelers </p><p>and freight canoes that bring goods from port and </p><p>Ask Adventure	189</p><p>take back the rubber, palm kernels, etc.; and helping </p><p>in the barter store, writing up the ledgers, until the </p><p>agent goes home or is transferred, when he becomes </p><p>agent. No intelligent person remains sub-agent </p><p>more than a few months. </p><p> The contract usually calls for three years.</p><p>Geology in Tennessee </p><p> Question:—“I am very much interested in the</p><p>study of plant life, geology and mineralogy and am </p><p>contemplating a trip if I can find a suitable place. </p><p>Arc there any veins of silver, lead or gold within the </p><p>boundaries of Tennessee that have not already been </p><p>worked? In the study of geology I delight in the </p><p>exploration of caves and climbing steep cliffs. If </p><p>there is anything in Tennessee worth while, could </p><p>you inform me?”—H. Carl Marmon, Tennessee </p><p>City, Tenn. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Liebe:—As to minerals, I do not</p><p>actually know of any veins of silver, lead, or gold </p><p>within this State that have not been worked. </p><p>Every now and then some native of these hills back </p><p>here thinks he has found something valuable, but </p><p>it has always, so far as I know, turned out to be </p><p>something else. However, here’s something I’ll </p><p>tell you for what it may be worth: </p><p> There used to be an iron furnace at Embreeville,</p><p>some 15 miles from here, in the hills. This outfit is </p><p>now digging zinc, and, I understand, in great </p><p>quantities. One of their men told me last Summer </p><p>that there was lead in the neighborhood of the zinc </p><p>mines. His name is Gudger Stewart; you might </p><p>write him. </p><p> In regard to “exploring caverns and climbing</p><p>steep cliffs,”—you should find plenty of that sort of </p><p>thing, notably steep cliffs, between here and Cran- </p><p>berry, N. C., a distance of 35 mile:;. Also, the new </p><p>C. C. &amp; O. Railway, which passes through here, can </p><p>show you some great stuff. In the mountains back </p><p>of TeUico Plains, which is at the end of a short rail- </p><p>road running back from Athens, this State, you will </p><p>find wonders—also, if you aren’t careful, some moon- </p><p>shiners that were real bad when I knew them. The </p><p>noted Clingman’s Dome and Ho Knob are in this </p><p>section. </p><p>Summer Cruises in Canada </p><p> Question:—“On the map one can go up the</p><p>Maniconagun River to Lake Kaniatichan; north </p><p>branch of the lake curves south and according to </p><p>scale comes within tvvleve miles of the center branch</p><p>of the Big River. Big River rims west into James </p><p>Bay. The Abitibi connects James Bay with Abi- </p><p>tibi Lake which is again touched by G. T. P. Ry. </p><p>Is it feasible to make this trip by canoe? Is a </p><p>portage of the length indicated feasible in that </p><p>country? How long would trip take going along </p><p>easily without loafing and without paddling your </p><p>arms out? What would be a reasonable cost? </p><p>Would one guide be enough? Is canoe and other </p><p>equipment obtainable from guide? How late in </p><p>the Fall could I start and, taking things easy, get out </p><p>before waters freeze up?”—O. S. Griffith, Phila- </p><p>delphia, Pa. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Sangster:—Of your listed queries</p><p>all rest on the first and second. I would hardly care </p><p>to advise the cruise over the waters you indicate </p><p>inasmuch as the trip is one that is hardly practical </p><p>and the map details without doubt are absolutely </p><p>estimated and inaccurate. </p><p> The Abitibi route is, of course, one of the most</p><p>used so-called “James Bay” routes of all. Person- </p><p>ally, I would not recommend a trip over any from </p><p>the standpoint of comfort, scenery, game, etc. It’s </p><p>too much hard work, too much [&gt;oling and portaging </p><p>and there is little at the northern end from a scenic </p><p>standpoint. </p><p> Far better are the cruising waters contiguous to</p><p>the Height of Land watershed, in a far superior </p><p>scenic region, with far better fishing and in a region </p><p>showing far more game of all kinds; the main wild- </p><p>life seen on the James Bay end is wild-fowl and geese. </p><p> Following are two suggested three or four week</p><p>cruises that I would much prefer for an all-round </p><p>canoe trip, combining A-l fishing, fine scenery, </p><p>enough white water to satiate any reasonable fel- </p><p>low, and the sight of all kinds of moose and other </p><p>life—viz.: </p><p> (1)	From Amos, on the Transcontinental Line,</p><p>138 miles east of Cochrane, in N. W. Quebec, south </p><p>through the Harricanaw head-waters—the Harri- </p><p>canaw also runs through to James Bay—thence over </p><p>the famous “Ottawa” portage into the Upper </p><p>Ottawa River and down it some 40 or 45 miles— </p><p>affording some exciling “white” stuff and fine fish- </p><p>ing—to the outlet of the Kenojevis River; turning </p><p>up this river some 14 miles and thence through the </p><p>Kiekiek Lakes, stretch out on big Kewagana Lake </p><p>and continuing through to Seal’s Nome Lake again, </p><p>back to Amos. On a 21-day trip in August I’ll </p><p>venture you could see from 35 to 85 or even more </p><p>moose, as well as beaver, otter, fox, lynx and all </p><p>kinds of black duck, etc. Fishing A-l. </p><p> (2)	From “O'Brien,” 30 miles west of Amos,</p><p>south through Lois Lake and over the two new </p><p>salmon and trout lakes lying on the Height of </p><p>Land, crossing into the Kenojevis and down through </p><p>its waters going through the Upper Ottawa Lakes </p><p>and river coming out at Ville Marie or Haileybury— </p><p>a splendid 21-day trip in August, affording sight of </p><p>moose, etc., and A-l fishing. </p><p> For either of these trips I can undertake to arrange</p><p>for a capable guide, canoe and everything but your </p><p>personal clothing and fishing tackle, at a definite cost </p><p>for either 21 or 28 days. </p><p> August will afford best chances to see most game,</p><p>but September affords the open hunting season. </p><p>Betel-Nut </p><p> Question:—“I have seen lots of items about the</p><p>betel-nut and wonderful results obtained from its </p><p>use. Do you know anything about it? Can you </p><p>give me the address of a man from whom I can pro- </p><p>cure some? I understand that betel-nut enables </p><p>one to undergo great fatigue.”—C. B. Ramsey, </p><p>Sandidges, Va. </p><p> Answer, by Captain Dingle:—The betel-nut is</p><p>simply the nut of a climbing pepper. It is grown </p><p>mostly in the Malay States and islands adjacent, </p><p>and India. The nut itself is about the size of a </p><p>hazelnut, though it grows in a membranous cover- </p><p>ing as big as a small potato. The people who chew </p><p>this stuff cut the nut into pieces, wrap a piece in </p><p>lime and the leaf of the betel, and then chew it. As </p><p>for tremendous stamina-giving properties, I don’t </p><p>know of them. The habit stains lips and mouth a </p><p>glaring red color; but preserves the teeth and im- </p><p>parts a more or less pleasant odor to the breath. </p><p> Perhaps the herb you are thinking of is the coco.</p><p>That is grown in South and Central Americas, and </p><p>Adventure </p><p>iyo </p><p>the coco leaf, chewed, does give wonderful vitality </p><p>and staying power. It is, of course, the base of </p><p>cocaine, and habitual use has almost as evil an </p><p>effect as the drug itself. In chewing this leaf, the </p><p>South American native uses ashes or lime with it, </p><p>just as the Malay does with his betel. This hastens </p><p>the extraction of the juices. </p><p> The only thing I can suggest is that you write to</p><p>some big importers, either South American or East </p><p>Indian, and ask them if they can supply small </p><p>quantities. You might get the coco leaves at a </p><p>good drug-store, but I don’t think you’ll get the </p><p>betel that way. A very good firm to try for the </p><p>coco is W. R. Grace, Hanover Square, New York. </p><p>But as these people are simply large merchants, and </p><p>conduct no small business, perhaps they would not </p><p>bother with a small order. But I think they would </p><p>at least inform you where these herbs can be got. I </p><p>have personally secured small parcels of coco locally, </p><p>but it was before the war, and since that I have been </p><p>unable ever to get any. That is the reason I can </p><p>not tell you more satisfactorily where you may get </p><p>the stuff. </p><p> To wind up perfectly candidly, I don’t advise you</p><p>to acquire either of these habits. If you propose </p><p>going on tremendously fatiguing expeditions in the </p><p>Andes, or in South America generally, you will </p><p>find in such places that the guides or natives can </p><p>supply you with all the coco you need. Both of </p><p>these things are very well in their place. They are </p><p>simply dope, though, and as such should not be </p><p>fooled with. </p><p> Chances in Upper Congo and Uganda</p><p> Question:—“Kindly inform me of the opportuni-</p><p>ties and adventures offered in the Upper Congo and </p><p>Uganda to a healthy young man of twenty-two years </p><p>of age with steamship and clerical experience. </p><p>Would be willing to go in at anything if I could get </p><p>the right opportunity or adventure.”—James G. </p><p>Valcos, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Beadle:—In the Upper Congo</p><p>and Uganda there is elephant and big-game shooting </p><p>generally; but small opportunities except for trad- </p><p>ing for which you would require considerable capi- </p><p>tal as well as experience. Most of the white men </p><p>there are in Government service, mining or rubber, </p><p>and obviously your clerical and steamship experi- </p><p>ence would be of little value there. Nearly all cleri- </p><p>cal work is done by Goanese and Indians. The </p><p>Rhodesias have plenty of openings in agriculture</p><p>and mining; but again your experience is of no par- </p><p>ticular value there. </p><p> Your best chance to get in would be with one of</p><p>the many firms trading on the West Coast where </p><p>your steamship life would be an asset. </p><p> I do not even mention the Transvaal as I take it</p><p>that you want to get a job with some chance of </p><p>adventure attached. </p><p>The Effect of the Tropics </p><p> Question:—“I read in Adventure about the sun</p><p>and other things ‘getting’ a white man in Africa. </p><p>Is this condition temporary or permanent? Would </p><p>a three-years stay in Africa so reduce the blood that </p><p>you could not stand cold climates such as Canada </p><p>and Alaska again?”—Thomas L. Coate, New York. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Miller:—Three years in the</p><p>tropics should not effect any permanent physical in- </p><p>jury. One soon reacclimatizes. Canned foods and </p><p>the heat enervate one and thin the blood, but one </p><p>soon recovers back home. The worst effect is not </p><p>physiological but psychological. After the lazy life </p><p>and freedom of the tropics it is hard for one to settle </p><p>back into the humdrum and commonplace; hard to </p><p>return to regular employment, to punching a time- </p><p>clock or sitting at a typewriter or clerking. But </p><p>that is an individual matter of will and ambition. </p><p> There are just now no direct steamship lines from</p><p>America to the Congo. You would have to reach </p><p>West Africa via Liverpool, Southampton, Hamburg </p><p>or Havre, in peace times, though just now the </p><p>Elder Dempster Steamship Co. and the West </p><p>African Line. The ports of call en route are Fun- </p><p>chal, Madeira; Las Palmas, the Grand Canaries; </p><p>Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, and such Gold </p><p>Coast ports as the freight and passengers call for. </p><p>A Trip in the Canal Zone </p><p> Question:—“A party of four wish to take a trip</p><p>up the Segovia River in Honduras, next November </p><p>with the idea of prospecting for gold. We wish to </p><p>obtain information as to camp equipment, supplies, </p><p>if carriers can be hired and if trade goods are in- </p><p>cluded. If conditions will permit we thought of </p><p>staying in the interior for twelve or fourteen months. </p><p>Where can I obtain literature on metallurgy? </p><p>What part of the Canal Zone, would you advise for </p><p>prospecting for gold? Where are the moon, or </p><p>canal, stones found—are they deep within the earth </p><p>or on surface?”—Edward A. McMahon, Pedro </p><p>Miguel, C. Z.</p><p> Answer, by Mr. Young:—My suggestion would</p><p>be to go to Corinto, on the Pacific side, and then go </p><p>by rail to Leon or some other city on the railroad </p><p>and then strike out and go overland from there to </p><p>the headwaters of the river. Getting up the Segovia </p><p>is a difficult matter. It is much easier to come </p><p>down. Without you have your own boat you will </p><p>find the native prices very high, asking as much as </p><p>eighty-eight dollars per ton to transport freight half- </p><p>way up the river. There are several English and </p><p>American owned mines in the western half of Nica- </p><p>ragua and Honduras where you could get a look at </p><p>the native ores first hand. The San Juancito mine </p><p>in Honduras has produced about twenty million </p><p>dollars in gold up to the present time. </p><p> As far as placer mining is concerned, you can get</p><p>any prospector to show you how it is done in a few </p><p>minutes. Call on Mr. C. W. Northrop, in the dis- </p><p>patcher’s office of the Panama Railroad at Ancon, </p><p>Canal Zone, and ask him to tell you about the na- </p><p>tive ores and how to look for placer mines. Get him </p><p>to introduce you to a native cholo who has pros- </p><p>pected for him. Mr. Northrop is an old friend of </p><p>mine and will do anything he can for you if you tell </p><p>him that I sent you. Get him to suggest a good book </p><p>on metallurgy, or better yet get him to loan you one. </p><p> There is gold up the Gatuncillo River from Gatun.</p><p>I knew five men who went up there and made wages </p><p>with a sluice box in 1908, but I can not say whether </p><p>the lake has covered up this ground or not. </p><p> The moon, or canal, stones you speak of were</p><p>found in the gravel pumped from the bed of the </p><p>Chagres River. There was a pile of this gravel near </p><p>Gorgona, which is now under water, I am sure, </p><p>which contained chucks of this stone. Get hold of </p><p>Mr. Freehan, a depot agent at Corozal or some </p><p>other station on Panama Railroad. He is'an expert </p><p>Ask Adventure </p><p>on stones of this kind and he and I have picked </p><p>up many a stone along the canal. I feel sure he can </p><p>tell you where some are to be found around there </p><p>right now. </p><p> Get hold of Mr. E. R. Brewer by asking the</p><p>Panama Railroad officials and get him to tell you </p><p>how to prepare for a trip on foot through the </p><p>jungles, and best of all get him to show you how to </p><p>roll a blanket-roE into an overalls pack. </p><p>Bois Blanc Island, Michigan </p><p> Question:—“Will you kindly let me know what</p><p>you can about Bois Blanc Island in upper Michi- </p><p>gan, as regards residence, climate, hunting, fishing, </p><p>automobile laws, estimated valuation of the land, </p><p>etc.?”—Thomas C. Kurtz, Pittsburgh, Pa. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Spears:—Bois Blanc Island, in</p><p>northwestern Lake Huron, possesses delightful </p><p>Great Lake climate in Summer; cool, comfortable, </p><p>with occasional warm days—probably ninety de- </p><p>grees; write Weather Bureau, Washington, D. C., </p><p>for reports covering weather and climate. Winters, </p><p>hard, grim, snow and cold, and communication often </p><p>interrupted with mainland by ice and storms. </p><p>After November first, bad weather—winds, gales, </p><p>rain and snow. Lake fishing is excellent, fine motor- </p><p>boating, but I question motoring as a pastime. </p><p> As for real-estate values; write to Postmaster,</p><p>Bois Blanc, Mackinac County, Michigan, and ask </p><p>for addresses of real-estate dealers, but on this </p><p>point you could check up prices asked by writing to </p><p>county clerk of Mackinac County, at St. Ignace, </p><p>Michigan, for information about assessed values— </p><p>probably much under market values. The post- </p><p>master at Bois Blanc could probably give you some </p><p>idea of values, himself; also, some idea of the game. </p><p>Detroit and Cleveland Navigation Company, De- </p><p>troit, Michigan, for steamer folders, and connections. </p><p> These Michigan and Huron islands are largely</p><p>occupied by fishermen and rafters, with some Sum- </p><p>mer population as at Mackinac Island, and, I be- </p><p>lieve, much fewer on Bois Blanc. I believe, too, </p><p>that there are a few Indians on Bois Blanc, but am </p><p>not sure. The postmaster would tell you the popula- </p><p>tion, and the local business, which will very likely in- </p><p>clude some stock-raising and farming, as well as fish- </p><p>ing, rafting, wrecking or towing. </p><p> The State Historical Society, Lansing, Michigan,</p><p>would doubtless refer you to published descriptive </p><p>matter covering this island, of recent date—maga- </p><p>zine articles, etc., covering some of the features you</p><p>inquire about. </p><p>Australian “Bushmen” </p><p> Question:—“I am very much interested in the Aus-</p><p>tralian bushman and his customs. I understand </p><p>that the older men of the tribes form clubs and treat </p><p>the younger ones very badly. Is this so? Please </p><p>give me any information available as regards cus- </p><p>toms, manners and location.”—E. D. Wagner, </p><p>Montgomery City, Mo. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Goldie:—What you know as the</p><p>Australian “bushman” is a species of tramp who </p><p>plods his way through the endless miles of the back </p><p>country of Australia, lazing his life away and work- </p><p>ing only at occasional small jobs on farms or sheep </p><p>“stations.” The term “bushman” is also used to </p><p>designate the real workers of the bush country but </p><p>I judge from your letter that you refer to those of </p><p>iyi </p><p>the order of tramps who, otherwise known as “swag- </p><p>mcn” and “sundowners,” have become a very </p><p>strange and interesting fraternity. </p><p> Far from being of the hobo class known in this</p><p>country the bush tramp of Australia is often well </p><p>educated and honest, though naturally there are </p><p>many who would answer to a poorer description. </p><p>The “swagman,” as he is generally known because </p><p>he always carries a “swag” comprising his few per- </p><p>sonal needs rolled up in a blanket and swung across </p><p>his shoulder, is well treated by the farming classes </p><p>because he often comes in useful to perform small </p><p>chores and to meet the demand for labor at the har- </p><p>vesting or shearing seasons. </p><p> It is customary to allow him a certain quantity of</p><p>flour and tea even though he does no work for it and </p><p>on this allowance he chiefly lives, making for him- </p><p>self a rough kind of bread known as “damper” and </p><p>stewing his tea in a billycan which he always carries. </p><p> Following the “wallaby track,” as the long bush</p><p>trail is popularly called, is said by many to be a </p><p>most fascinating occupation for those who have no </p><p>ties and who have tired of city life. I met a Gov- </p><p>ernment official in London once who told me that </p><p>he had done many adventurous things in life, </p><p>but nothing called to him so insistently as the Aus- </p><p>tralia bush where in sunshine and silence he had </p><p>found himself drawn closer to nature than any- </p><p>where else he had been. </p><p> You refer in your letter to tribes. I wonder if</p><p>you mean the blacks. If so I must tell you that the</p><p>Australian aborigines have almost died out and ex- </p><p>cepting in parts of northern and central Australia </p><p>which are otherwise uninhabited are rarely encoun- </p><p>tered in their original tribal state. I know of no </p><p>such custom as you suggest. A great mistake is </p><p>made by many people in thinking of Australian </p><p>bushmen as blacks whereas in point of fact Austra- </p><p>lia is one of the “whitest” countries in the world. </p><p>The few blacks that arc left are of the lowest order </p><p>of humanity, have few tribal customs left and are </p><p>dying out so rapidly thet they will soon be entirely </p><p>extinct. </p><p>Wintering in British Columbia </p><p> Question:—“My pal and I wish to spend a Winter</p><p>some place in the Northwest, and have about de- </p><p>cided upon British Columbia. Can you tell us of a </p><p>place where the hunting and fishing are good? How </p><p>are the chances for prospecting? How about the </p><p>customs, regulations—would it be better to buy an </p><p>outfit there?”—Edward D. Cook, Jr., U. S. S. </p><p>Louisiana. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Carson:—The Cariboo District</p><p>seems to be about what you fellows are looking for. </p><p>There is plenty of game there, a fair amount of fur, </p><p>good fishing and a chance to prospect with a reason- </p><p>able hope of success. </p><p> Get your outfit there where you will have some</p><p>one to advise you as to what you need. It is impos- </p><p>sible for any one to tell another man just what he </p><p>will want. As you are aware, tastes differ especially </p><p>as to what is really necessary for comfort. You will </p><p>save all the trouble of transportation and customs </p><p>while the price will be about the same. </p><p> With regard to the customs regulations, you can</p><p>take in outfit by depositing with the collector of </p><p>customs an amount equal to the duty which would </p><p>be paid otherwise. If you return within six months </p><p>and have your stuH identified this will be refunded </p><p>to you. </p><p>Adventure </p><p>LOST </p><p>TRAILS </p><p> Note—We offer this department of the "Camp-Fire" free of charge to those of our read-</p><p>ers who wish to get in touch again with old friends or acquaintances from whom the years </p><p>have separated them.

We asked </p><p>specifically for their best economical recipes. </p><p>And hundreds of women in all sections of </p><p>France have answered our appeal. </p><p> These recipes, as delicious as they are eco-</p><p>nomical, are being given to American house- </p><p>wives each month in The Delineator. They </p><p>will prove a revelation. Each one has been suc- </p><p>cessfully tested by Honore Wilkie, the editor. </p><p> For instance, here is a recipe sent in by Mme.</p><p>Louise Bocquet of the French town of Flers de </p><p>l’Orne. It is a recipe for Hindu biscuits given </p><p>her by a Hindu officer billeted at her house. </p><p>The ingredients are simply one ounce of flour, </p><p>one ounce of butter, one ounce of grated cheese. </p><p> The French recipes in one number alone will</p><p>save you many times the price of a year’s sub-, </p><p>scription. Do not miss any issue of The Delin-</p><p>eator. It is a family necessity. Invest in it to-day. </p><p>&lt;me DELINEATOR </p><p> Butterick -Publisher</p></body></text></TEI>
