What</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Disney's surprise then, to see him</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothed in evening dress of rather un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashionable type--although Disney was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all unconscious of this--with a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">white tie clumsily arranged about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat, and shod in new and squeaky</seg><seg type="columnLine">patent-leather shoes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jumping Jehosaphat!" ejaculated</seg><seg type="columnLine">Disney, leaping to his feet and taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reade by the lapel of his coat; "been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fire-sale somewhere?" Reade wore a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dignity which did not exactly become</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, as he replied, much to the amuse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of his friend:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In good society, Henry, it is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered proper to comment on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend's clothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aw, g'wan!

Then he hesitated a moment, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though afraid that Disney would laugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him, and continued:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Miss Lanvale's having a theatre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">party at the Opera House to-morrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">night.

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused Reade to make a wondering in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiry, and Disney thrust out a letter for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his perusal. He glanced over it, down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the signature, when he exclaimed:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, this is signed 'Phipps Mayna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dier!'"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lawyer's monicker, evidently," re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned Disney.

He handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the photographs to Reade. "I never saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pop, that I can remember; he was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Britisher. Ma said he used to hit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">booze sumpin' fierce. Good-lookin' guy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't he?" Reade was gasping in as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonishment as he looked on the fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures in the photograph.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, Henry!

"Your father</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an English army officer!" and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance of admiration overspread his</seg><seg type="columnLine">countenance, as he looked at Disney.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The latter took another look at the pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, and then up at Reade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll say this for you, Buck; you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up a lot, readin' those books o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours.

"So</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pop was a swell, was he ?" and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked away with an amusing stride.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wish to God mine had been," so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liloquized Reade, disconsolately.

Dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney patted him on the shoulder again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he turned away slightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looks like we ought to swap fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thers, Buck," and stopped as a knock</seg><seg type="columnLine">came at the door. "Guess that's the law-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yer.

She wore a black-and-</seg><seg type="columnLine">white tailored suit, with a small velvet</seg><seg type="columnLine">toque trimmed with aigrettes, black</seg><seg type="columnLine">lynx furs, and carried a variety of gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">jingles on a chain. As Disney saw her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he dived for his coat, and Reade was</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticeably ill at ease. The young lady</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a look of surprise at Reade's get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, but smiled as she turned to him. -</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sure I beg your pardon. Are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Disney?" Reade was stupefied, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Disney came forward with an air of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallantry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's me, Miss. Can I do anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you ?" and he glanced at her polite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly but admiringly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've been visiting my old nurse up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs, and stayed longer than I expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to. It's dark, and raining now, so I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">want a cab to get home. Will you fetch</seg><seg type="columnLine">me one?" Disney laughed good-natured-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly at the thought of such a thing, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaining that she couldn't get a cab in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this district with a search-warrant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They don't have any use for them</seg><seg type="columnLine">things down this way, 'cept for wed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">din's and funerals." Reade suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cab-stand at a distant corner, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Disney asked if she would await his re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">484</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREEN BOOK ALBUM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">turn until he could phone to this place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would only take about ten minutes to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have the cab there. Reade questioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the propriety of her waiting there alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him, but Disney chipped in with.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"A lot she cares what people down this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">way think/'	„</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, you're wrong, Mr. Disney</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he broke in on her almost roughly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't throw a bluff, little lady.

Her expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhibited her doubt of his being a fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nace-tender, and she asked to see his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, after an examination of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">she expressed her disbelief openly, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he explained that soap and pumice-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone had virtues of their own. On her</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioning his attire, he explained:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're the first I ever had." She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had unconsciously touched his vanity in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a soothing manner, and had reached his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. "I bought them ready made. Are</seg><seg type="columnLine">they all right?" She looked him over</seg><seg type="columnLine">critically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All except the tie. Shall I show</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?" and as he moved towards her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she untied the mess, and then, as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">lied it neatly, explained carefully to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">how she did it, that he might do like-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise in future, adding that she always</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied her father's for him. "Poor old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dad didn't wear dress ties until he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly forty." Reade's wide-open eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this announcement, caused her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">add: "You see, he began life as an oys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter-shucker, and they don't really need</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know anything about dress clothes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie's Peter Parkyn; ever hear of him?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reade's eyes were opening wider all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Parkyn Pickling Co.?"

The young man expressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise that there should be any ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion as to her eligibility to such events.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You see," she continued, "they can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget that Dad was an oyster-shueker.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's why rich American girls gener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally marry foreigners.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was getting his first real lesson in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">requirements of a society man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean to say that when a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">has made money, he can't get into so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciety even then?"

But in a town like this--</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, it's big, but awfully little in these</seg><seg type="columnLine">things." The conversation drifted on in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this channel, until finally Reade was</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck with an inspiration, and asked if</seg><seg type="columnLine">she knew a Miss Lanvale, and if so, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was like the society people Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parkyn had pictured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She spells 'Society' with a double</seg><seg type="columnLine">'S,' and a hiss like a snake."

However, at that mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, a cab was heard to stop before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, and the two men rushed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window, where they saw a man step-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping to the sidewalk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Phipps Maynadier, I'll bet," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reade, turning to Disney for confirma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion--on which announcement Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parkyn swung about to them, with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">air of reproach, asking what it meant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if they had been putting up a game</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her. Before they could answer or</seg><seg type="columnLine">c?:plain, there was a knock, and Disney</seg><seg type="columnLine">admitted Mr. Maynadier, who gave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pronounced start as he saw the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady, in the presence of these working</seg><seg type="columnLine">men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was not a bad-looking man, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Phipps Maynadier--somewhat lean, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">exceedingly well-groomed, wearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes of the latest cut, and carrying a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold-headed cane; he was inclined to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">dandified, and having an air of super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciliousness which spoiled the otherwise</seg><seg type="columnLine">good impression one might have had</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him on first acquaintance. He bit his</seg><seg type="columnLine">small moustache in nervousness, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then apologized for his seeming intru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Couldn't have come at a better</seg><seg type="columnLine">time," said Disney, enthusiastically.</seg><seg type="columnLine">''The break's just right."

Miss Parkyn</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore a slight smile during the prelimi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary explanations, but now walked over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Maynadier, eyeing him coolly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hate to be a bother, but it's rain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and the street cars are five blocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">off."

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to apologize, on which Disney</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">turned away to conceal his amusement</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Miss Parkyn's remark, and she went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on : "Yes, Mr. Maynadier; but we don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffer from the same handicap that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">do.

May-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nadier made a brave display of apolo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gy for having called her father a "qual-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ified canner," and offered his cab.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I've no false pride," she re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned.

I'm common, I am; dead com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon; and I don't care who knows it!</seg><seg type="columnLine">See?" Maynadier, seeing he had got</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in wrong to start, endeavored</seg><seg type="columnLine">to smooth matters by announcing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Disney was far from being common, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time asking for the papers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and photographs about which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">written. Disney swept the lot over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maynadier with a gesture of disgust.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's the junk! What's doing?" The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawyer examined everything very care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully, and holding them in one hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended the other to Disney.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your Grace, I congratulate you!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Disney withheld his hand, looking at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maynadier as though the latter had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken leave of his senses, and eyeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the papers closely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who gave you leave to take my pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pers? Come through with them; come</seg><seg type="columnLine">on!" But Maynadier only held them the</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer, bowing to Disney.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shall have to take them with me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They are necessary to prove your iden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tity as the Right Honorable Henry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lancaster Morpeth Orth, Knight Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mander of the Bath, Baron Glenroy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knight of the Garter, Earl of Flint and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duke of Walshire." Disney listened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tins rigmarole with an expression of</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgust and disbelief, and then shouted:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say, Chief ! You don't know me well</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to pull any of that kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff! Maynadier replaced the pictures</seg><seg type="columnLine">and papers on the table, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time taking a photograph from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pocket, and pointed to it, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaining that the original was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third son of the Duke of Walshire;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had been lost track of since</seg><seg type="columnLine">he left England, after having got</seg><seg type="columnLine">into trouble; that his eldest brother had</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken his neck while fox-hunting; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">second brother was killed in Afghanis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tan, and the two sons of the eldest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">brother had been drowned while yacht-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Taking up Disney's photograph of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his father, he showed that the two were</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the same party. Reade had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">intensely interested during this, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now glancing over Maynadier's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Henry! He's not kidding! It's so!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's so!" he said excitedly. Disney</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked from one to the other, not know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing what to do or say, and hardly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieving his own ears. Maynadier then</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled all doubts in his mind by in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forming him that the New York law-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yers, of whom he was the representa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive, had learned that his father had</seg><seg type="columnLine">assumed the name of Disney arid had</seg><seg type="columnLine">married Celia Boggers, and that after</seg><seg type="columnLine">their death, he, Henry Disney, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come here to live with his uncle, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom he had learned this address, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluding the explanation with the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark :</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You go to England as the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in the United Kingdom--next to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the royal family--the Duke of Wal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shire." Disney opened his capacious</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth widely at this, gave a choking</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasp, and sat heavily in a conveniently</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjacent chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good -- Gawd ! -- Me! -- a -- a --</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dook!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thought for a second, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned fiercely on Maynadier: "This'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">better be on the level, or somebody'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">get killed!" Maynadier only smiled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this threat, and bowed again to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lordship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have five residences: Flint</seg><seg type="columnLine">House. Cadogan Square; Beaulieu Ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bey, Berks; Castle Gwvnnwydd, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marches; Richmond Castle--" but Dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney checked him in furious resentment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising to his feet, and glancing about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his poor quarters, feeling that all this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was some cruel, practical joke, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the innocent Maynadier was playing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He couldn't realize that such for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune could be his, nor that Maynadier,</seg><seg type="columnLine">never even having heard of him be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, could have anv possible motive for</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing a trick of this kind. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only fighting mad through and through,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked much as though he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">heave the lawyer through the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed as it was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">SNOBS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">487</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's funny, aint it!" said Disney</seg><seg type="columnLine">catching the smile on the face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sycophantic lawyer, who was seated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time.

"You sit there and tell me</seg><seg type="columnLine">how great I'm goin' to be, an' all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time you're sayin' to yourself: 'If it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only me what's gettin' what this cheap</seg><seg type="columnLine">skate's gettin'Is Yes! An' you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're better'n me all the time you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretendin' respect," and he tore on in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rage, informing Maynadier how he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to be a milk-wagon driver,</seg><seg type="columnLine">starting in to earn his living when only</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve years old, pointing to his big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coarse hands, as evidence of the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was nothing but a workman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He didn't thank anyone for dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">and making him a "Dook," deliberately</seg><seg type="columnLine">accusing Maynadier of acting as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought Disney was trying to butt</seg><seg type="columnLine">in where he didn't belong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But Your Grace--" Maynadier</seg><seg type="columnLine">started.

Reade</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to mend matters somewhat, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitatingly suggested:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, if you're a duke, Henry, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't go on driving a milk-wagon." Dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney turned on Reade, as though he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected him to stand up for his rights</seg><seg type="columnLine">as an American citizen, and was disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed on seeing him go over to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen, Buck! I aint got any affec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion for that milk-wagon.

Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to Maynadier with a remark and</seg><seg type="columnLine">look which was meant to settle the mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter once and for all. "You can't make</seg><seg type="columnLine">no Dook outa me, just by tellin' me I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am one," and to Maynadier's query as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to what Disney suggested as a way out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the situation, he continued: "You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunna teach me what I'm gunna do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Teach me, see ?

He showed Disney</seg><seg type="columnLine">a copy of one of the dailies, to prove</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the publicity had already been</seg><seg type="columnLine">started. The "Dook" gave a sigh of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lief, after glancing it over, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that his name was not mentioned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maynadier was then for taking Dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney to New York, where he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a better opportunity to remain incog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nito, but the latter wouldn't hear of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Member that girl that was here just</seg><seg type="columnLine">now?" he asked, in the most serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner. "Miss Parkyn?" Maynadier</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded, and wondered what she might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to do with the situation. "Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she made a hit with me. I'm for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong! When she walked out, I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever expect to see her again, 'cause I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a milk-wagon driver, and she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a real swell lady; but there's been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh deal since then, and she can play</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my ancestral castles, if she takes a</seg><seg type="columnLine">notion. See?" Maynadier smiled in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">supercilious manner, and his nose ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vated just a trifle as he remarked:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You wont have to ask her but</seg><seg type="columnLine">once!" Disney was inclined to become</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry at the interference of Mayna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dier, and questioned the possibility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Parkyn's liking him, or even</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking of him a second time, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">having seen him but once, but Mayna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dier called his attention to the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">488</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREEN BOOK ALBUM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">any Hr! would jump at the chance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">being Duchess of Walsh,re.

She was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">care-free little woman, sufficiently in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dependent, so that the apparent cool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the others affected her not at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all; in fact, it rather amused her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hulloa, Laura," she chirped. "Seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Phipps Maynadier to-day?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have not seen Mr. Maynadier,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Laura, and the very slight inflec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion she placed on the "Mr." caused a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile on the lips of the questioner, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she passed it by as not worthy of note.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She invited the others to tea with her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they declined, so she ordered some</seg><seg type="columnLine">for herself, to be served there, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeded to inform Laura regarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">her trip of the previous night, of having</seg><seg type="columnLine">met Maynadier there, and that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned on her return home, that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">"dug up a Duke."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know, I've an idea that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">met him." Here was occasion for Laura</seg><seg type="columnLine">to unbend, which she did, to the obvious</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoyment of the other, who read her</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a book, and her amusement was</seg><seg type="columnLine">even greater to see Mrs. Beauregard</seg><seg type="columnLine">relax a bit of her habitual stiffness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">frigidity at the mention of royalty. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Lanvale's query as to what his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lordship looked like, she continued:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, on one hand, he was slender,</seg><seg type="columnLine">romantic and very much in love with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She spoke off-handedly, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the process of falling in with royalty</seg><seg type="columnLine">were an every-day occurrence with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. But Laura, at the mention of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man being in love with her, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than ever interested, and Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beauregard gave her chair an extra</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitch, the better to hear the conversa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Miss Parkyn lost not one jot of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, and having started things well, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared to go on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In love with me? What are you talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about, Nondas?" The boy entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the sandwiches and tea, setting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tray before Miss Parkyn, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lanvales, aunt and niece, maintained</seg><seg type="columnLine">their patience until he had left. Nondas</seg><seg type="columnLine">started with her little lunch very calm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, allowing the others to start the ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling again, and then she talked very</seg><seg type="columnLine">indifferently about her experience, afl</seg><seg type="columnLine">the while enjoying Laura's nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiety as to how the Duke could know</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything of her. With a mouth-full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandwich, she looked up, and went on:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He showed you through the Mount</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clare shops once, he told me." Laura</seg><seg type="columnLine">clasped her hands ecstatically, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">romance of the situation dawned upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, and turned to her aunt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I remember. He was very good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking, and had beautiful manners,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then she turned back to Nondas, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though to coax more information. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was the Duke of Walshire?--Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancy," and again her mind flew off to</seg><seg type="columnLine">castles in the air. Already she was plan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning how she could meet? the Duke;</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether, now that he was a Duke, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would still care for her, and what she</seg><seg type="columnLine">should do when she was in reality a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duchess. These dreams are so beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">--for women of American society. Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parkyn ate on. with a perfectly bland</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression, but an unobserved twinkle</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her eye; she seemed to be chewing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cud of reflection, as though she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to "put over" on Miss Lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vale, and was figuring on how best to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplish this. She looked up, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">far-away expression, which was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what akin to Laura's previous one, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she added:</seg><seg type="columnLine">490</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREEN BOOK ALBUM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On the other hand, he was freckled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad-shouldered, and drove a milk-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wagon/' There was no smile on her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, for she was back in the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and looking at the big, good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">natured fellow who had run the errand</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her; it mattered little to her whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">be was a Duke, if circumstances could</seg><seg type="columnLine">only be brought about--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you doing, Nondas?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laura's tone of annoyance brought her</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to her repast in one bound. "De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribing two entirely different persons</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Duke of Walsh ire?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, there were two of them," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again the mischievous look came. "One</seg><seg type="columnLine">was named Reade; the other, Disney.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Disney had freckles--and a sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">humor. Reade had been educating him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self on ten-cent novels, bound in dollar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">and-a-half covers; current literature, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact; free library stuff." Laura listened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then hesitated, as she figured how</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ask the question uppermost in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, but Nondas anticipated her. "In</seg><seg type="columnLine">love with you? Why. Reade was. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">been reading 'King Cophetua and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beggar Maid,' and he's got you cast for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the metamorphosed male lead." Laura</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to be dignified, as she withdrew</seg><seg type="columnLine">a step, and asked, with an air of almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredulity:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How could he be in love with me?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nondas stopped in the act of biting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandwich, glancing at Laura critically</seg><seg type="columnLine">from head to foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm blessed if I know. No sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">humor, probably." Laura's anger was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused by this, but Nondas diplomat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ically smoothed the ruffled waters, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laura again asked if she really thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reade was the Duke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, he's nearer the popular con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ception of a nobleman than the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who drove the milk-wagon. Oh, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgot to ask you, Laura," and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned from her cup of tea again: "Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Duke eligible to marry into the Lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vale family?" She noted Laura's look</seg><seg type="columnLine">of surprise and query, but went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">very innocently: "You see, if it should</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn out that Mr. Reade were the Duke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was just wondering if his family</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be good enough to permit you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be his wife?" Laura was inclined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be sarcastic, as she endeavored to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">give Nondas a lesson in the rights of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">royalty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Duke of Walshire is the great-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est nobleman in England, Nondas. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">can keep his hat on in the King's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">presence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Does the family have a chronic cold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or do they get bald early?" Nondas'</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression was an absolutely bland one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this annoyed Laura.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nondas! Is nothing sacred to you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Money is. Speaking of that, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duke of Walshire has fourteen million</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds sterling. I thought from that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his grandfather might be a retired</seg><seg type="columnLine">brewer." Laura became frigidly up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">right in her carriage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's one of the oldest titles in Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, then the money must have come</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a perfectly gentlemanly manner--like</seg><seg type="columnLine">marrying some woman who had it "</seg><seg type="columnLine">She turned to see a boy entering with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the afternoon papers, and taking one</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him, opened it, to learn the latest</seg><seg type="columnLine">news of the Duke. "This will tell us</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is the Duke--Reade or Disney."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She looked it over very carefully,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laura standing by her side, and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Beauregard, after a second's hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation, went over to the young ladies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Laura introduced her to Nondas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after her query as to whether she</seg><seg type="columnLine">"knew the young lady?" Mrs. Beaure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gard inclined her head at the introduc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, as though in great pain, thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">acknowledging Nondas' necessary, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">undesirable,presence. Nondas' acknowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edgment was almost equally cool, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then she turned slightly, writh a smile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she remarked quietly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I always like to know who's looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">over my shoulder." The elder lady</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepted the thrust by turning with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">air of great dignity, and going to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, where she sat again. Nondas</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched her, and then reopened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper, looking it over until she gave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little cry of pleasure as she found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">article she wished. A second later she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was disappointed. "Wre're done, Laura.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The mystery of the missing Duke is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not explained in this instalment," but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laura didn't grasp it. "Thimble, thim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble; who's got the thimble? Phipps</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maynadier refuses to give any informa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">SNOBS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">491</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. He says the Duke is found; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is in an humble situation, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew nothing of his good fortune,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she again looked at the article,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reading aloud: " 'The Duke does not</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire his identity to become known at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the present time, for reasons he does</seg><seg type="columnLine">not care to explain.'" She handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laura the paper, and looked at her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now's the time." said she, glancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly at Laura, "to use your knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of blood and breeding. Surely a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lanvale ought to be able to smell out</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Duke," and with this Parthian shot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she left to change from her golf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Beauregard looked after her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then snorted: "An odious thing;</seg><seg type="columnLine">ill-bred, and utterly common." Laura</seg><seg type="columnLine">was down-cast for a moment, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the idea of the Duke took hold of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and she switched around to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">aunt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you suppose she was telling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth about the Duke?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why should she," snapped that lady.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Other men have been in love with you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Phipps Maynadier, for instance." Laura</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave her head a slight toss at the men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the lawyer's name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes; but a Duke! How romantic it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be! Think of meeting him, as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">laborer. And I hardly noticed him, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept that he was a very respectable</seg><seg type="columnLine">person." Then she aviated again to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-castles, until her aunt brought her</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to earth by asking what she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">day-dreaming about. "Think of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wife of the premier peer--the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady of England! Why, I should walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Court directly after the royal fam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily. The first lady of England! And he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a multi-millionaire, besides!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then followed an argument between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two as to the social standing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lanvale family, of which both of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">were members. There seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">some question in the mind of her aunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to whether Laura would really be</seg><seg type="columnLine">eligible as the wife of the Duke of Wal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shire, for was he not as far above her</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she had been alx&gt;ve him, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a furnace-tender? Then also arose</seg><seg type="columnLine">the question as to whether or not there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not some definite understanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">between Laura and Maynadier, at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which Miss Laura was virtuously in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dignant. How dare anyone question her</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Maynadier, when she had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity to land a Duke ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's likely I'd bother about Phipps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I could have the Duke of Walshire!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You haven't snared your ducal bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the bush yet," returned her aunt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a sweetness of tone which fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boded further trouble, if the young lady</seg><seg type="columnLine">persisted against her wishes. "And you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have got Phipps in the palm of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, if I marry him, it means the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same kind of poverty I've had all my</seg><seg type="columnLine">life; and poverty on ten thousand a year</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the worst kind of poverty there is;</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know that, Aunt Phoebe,"--and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elder woman signified her knowledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact by an expressive nod of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. "Besides, the moment I go to New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York, London and Paris--any big city</seg><seg type="columnLine">--I'm a nonentity. I want to be some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body in the big world, not in this small</seg><seg type="columnLine">one." Her aunt gave her a sympathiz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing glance, as of one who had passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the mill years ago, and knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">whereof she was speaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dear, it's pretty nice to be some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body anywhere.

She started for the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Laura dragged herself after her</seg><seg type="columnLine">aunt, and peered through the lattice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here comes Bradley Fairfax!" Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">aunt also looked in that direction, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost sank back on the floor as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And who's that he has with him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He must be quite all right, or Brad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley wouldn't be seen with him.

He was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight for the gods, and the environ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of the Country Club, used as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were to strange sights, must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembled on their foundations when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he appeared. Why is it that large men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even those whose knowledge of dress</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be correct, will invariably array</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves in something loud ? Do they</seg><seg type="columnLine">think their bulk wont attract sufficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention ? Possibly. However that may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be.

All of them cost good</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, for he had been lavish, but all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which fitted him semi-occasionally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having been ready-made, and Disney's</seg><seg type="columnLine">manly bulk was not of a sort to permit</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ready-made type of clothes to hang</seg><seg type="columnLine">just right. He had large, dog's-head</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuff-buttons on his sleeve extremities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and carried a stick, with the same em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blem on the head of it; these were all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid gold, with ruby eyes for the ca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nines, and the stick created a louder</seg><seg type="columnLine">report than the wearer himself.

Fairfax denied all</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of her, anyway. "Well, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">aint my style of a club, then, so I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">think I'll join. Why, in our little club</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had over a delicatessen store down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Pratt street, we was all 'Buck' and</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Hen' and 'Bill' to one another."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The situation was becoming painful</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Fairfax, who was afraid some one</seg><seg type="columnLine">would enter and discover him with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearful person, and again he endeav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ored to break away, but Disney's hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him was sure, and he asked him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be friendly enough to give his opinion</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his apparel. Fairfax hesitated, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hemmed a bit. Disney only held to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the harder, and tried to pin him down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to facts, explaining that he had "flitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">from store to store" all by himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">buying the best he could find. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">becoming very much interested in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">account, when Nondas entered, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">SNOBS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">493</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">made a change to an afternoon walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress, carrying her Russian sable coat</seg><seg type="columnLine">over her arm. Disney saw her the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment she entered, and turned to her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still holding onto Fairfax.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, there you are. I called on you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they said you were out here, so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hired a big pink autahmobeel, to match</seg><seg type="columnLine">my pink tic--and here I am," and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled blandly at her. Her amusement</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his dress was great, but she managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cover it sufficiently to avoid hurting</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feelings, and gave her attention to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that his grip on Fairfax was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurting that gentleman's dignity, if not</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feelings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm afraid you're hurting your</seg><seg type="columnLine">young friend, Mr. Disney." Fairfax</seg><seg type="columnLine">begged to be released, now that Disney</seg><seg type="columnLine">had found Miss Parkyn, but Disney</seg><seg type="columnLine">refused until he had introduced the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">club members. He gave Miss Parkyn's</seg><seg type="columnLine">name, and then hesitated, as he remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered he didn't know the name of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man he was holding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's your name. Chief ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My name can be of no use to you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir," snapped Fairfax. "I repeat em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phatically, I don't know you!" Disney</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to appreciate more thoroughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation, and resolved to make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the funny side of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, is that all? Well, my name's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Disney. Now you know me." Nondas'</seg><seg type="columnLine">appreciation of the situation was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense, but she concealed her satisfaction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it, and added her drop of sarcasm to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rapidly rising flood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am afraid I must agree with your</seg><seg type="columnLine">young friend, Mr. Disney. Your meth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">od of introduction is a bit primitive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before introducing people, you ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find out if they desire it, and as your</seg><seg type="columnLine">young friend is seemingly ashamed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his name, I should prefer not to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">him." This was a staggerer to Fairfax.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That he, one of the very elite of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city's aristocracy, should be snubbed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a young woman whom nearly every</seg><seg type="columnLine">member of the exclusive set had in turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">snubbed! He spluttered angrily:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ashamed of my name? Prefer not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to meet me?" Disney looked from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the other, not quite getting this, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling an apology due Miss Parkyn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Gee! I ought to be more careful!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Then on second thought: "But he's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">member of the club, so he must be all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. Or, maybe," as another thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke in, "he just said he was a mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber," and he took a firmer grip on Fair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fax, as though to administer chastise-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, if such proved the case. "Go see</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he's on the square with that talk, Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parkyn. I don't want to get in wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first day I come out here." Fairfax</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fairly boiling with impotent wrath</seg><seg type="columnLine">by this time and endeavored to shake</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself free, but he might as well have</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to free himself from the grip of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an enraged bull-dog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You! Why, confound you!" But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Disney only turned his sunny smile on</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, which aggravated Fairfax the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't get peeved, Archibald. Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member; anything you say will be used</seg><seg type="columnLine">against you. It's my fault; I brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">you here." On this, Nondas, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to keep her face straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout, burst into an uncontrollable</seg><seg type="columnLine">fit of laughter, while Fairfax turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and twisted unavailingly, Disney look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from one to the other, as though to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn from Nondas what he should do</seg><seg type="columnLine">next with his victim. Then Mrs. Beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">regard arose in all her matronly dignity</seg><seg type="columnLine">and might, to freeze both Nondas and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Disney with a look and a word, but Dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney only wondered where she blew in</seg><seg type="columnLine">from, and Nondas cared little for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matronly interference.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This has gone far enough," she ut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered, as she swept majestically into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">view of the others. Laura followed her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a reproving look at Nondas, whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">she addressed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nondas, you should be ashamed;</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know very well this is Mr. Fair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fax." Nondas turned coolly to Laura,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling very innocently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He doesn't know me; how could I</seg><seg type="columnLine">be expected to know him ?" Fairfax</seg><seg type="columnLine">took fresh courage at the intervention</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the feminine squad, and threatened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to complain to the club authorities. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to Disney.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You, sir, shall be--" but Disney gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him an extra shake at this threat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shall be!" And again Fairfax felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">his courage oozing, and turned piteous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly to Mrs. Beauregard for assistance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREEN BOOK ALBUM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mrs. Pen, I appeal to you. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither an athlete nor a pugilist, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this--this person is very strong." Sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moning all her dignity, the lady ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pealed to, addressed Disney, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">much against her better judgment, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not yet been introduced to her, thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">putting her in the way of breaking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conventional rules of society.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Young man, release that gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man!" Disney looked at Mrs. Beaure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gard. and then turned to Nondas for</seg><seg type="columnLine">permission to put this command into ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ecution. That young lady, endeavoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">to assume a dignified manner, which she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was far from feeling, told Disney, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Fairfax seemed to know the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladies, he must come from a respectable</seg><seg type="columnLine">family, and requested, for his family's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sake, that he be released, and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">freed. When far enough away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Disney, Fairfax again spoke of com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaint to the board of governors, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Pen remarked about the inadvisa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility of admitting anyone and every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to the sacred precincts, whereupon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nondas applied her little whip again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing to Fairfax.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This young man should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of that before he brought his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Madam!" exclaimed Fairfax in pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">test, but Nondas cut in again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't call me 'Madam.' I only al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low the butcher and baker to do that,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and both she and Disney smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside. Fairfax finished his sentence in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect fury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is not my friend--he is not my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend !--not, not, not my friend!" Non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">das looked almost as though she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to set this speech to music, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned calmly to Disney for another</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust at Fairfax.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The young man is very much hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">by your coldness, Mr. Disney. Be his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend!" Disney crossed over to Fair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fax, offering his hand, which Fairfax,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in surprise, did not deign to accept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, Chief. I don't hold any</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard feelings,'' but Fairfax was alto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether speechless at this turn of affairs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so Disney grasped his limp hand, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook it warmly, turning to Nondas</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, to see if everything was all right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laura then deemed it advisable to take</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a hand in the proceedings, and scolded</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nondas for Disney's presence, stating</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if the latter didn't leave immediate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, she and her aunt would make a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaint, and Disney would be put out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was sufficient for the ex-milk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagon driver, and he promptly turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">back his cuffs, turning to Laura.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lady, if you've got a bouncer that</seg><seg type="columnLine">wants some exercise, trot him out! I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">oblige him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Phipps Maynadier's entrance on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene prevented what might have hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened, and he was horror-stricken to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find Disney present. The latter turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him as to an old friend, explaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had arrived just in time to wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness a nice little scrap, as "this lady,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he indicated Miss Laura, "is going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have me put out of the club." On</seg><seg type="columnLine">Disney speaking in this friendly man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner to Maynadier, Mrs. Pen looked as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though she would have need of smelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">salts, asking him faintly if he "knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">this person,"--which question Laura</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost simultaneously chirruped. Fair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fax started again with his protest</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the outrageous conduct, etc.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Maynadier, seeing the futility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other explanation, said, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced smile:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's a great practical joker, Disney</seg><seg type="columnLine">is. So you've all made his acquaintance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have you ?" Fairfax denied that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure had been his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, didn't you just shake me by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hand, and say you wanted to be my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend?" and Disney started as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">to grasp Fairfax by the hand again, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter sought refuge behind the law-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Phipps, if that person lays a hand on</seg><seg type="columnLine">me again--" but Mrs. Beauregard was</seg><seg type="columnLine">starting for the door, afraid that an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">troduction to her would come next, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">called for Laura to follow suit. May-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nadier detained Laura for a few words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mrs. Pen commissioned Fairfax</seg><seg type="columnLine">to escort her to the Turkish room for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquor brandy, as she felt faint, and thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">they made their escape from the detest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed presence. Maynadier turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">SNOBS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">495</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I^aura, and Nondas and Disney imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately became engaged in a conversa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion on the merits of his outfit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've the courage of your convic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Mr. Disney, but your necktie is</seg><seg type="columnLine">shocking," and she laughed happily;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"it's almost a cravat." Disney looked in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his neck, as well as the fatness of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chin would permit, and said ruefully:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought it was a pretty shade."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nondas took him sympathetically by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm, as she half turned him toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then I'd advise you to give up</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking altogether." She looked him</seg><seg type="columnLine">over from head to foot, as she added:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You know' you wouldn't look half bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you were dressed properly." Laura</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Phipps had become interested in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this discussion by this time, and Laura</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to reprove Nondas for speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Disney about his clothes thus. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">this had no more effect on the independ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent young Miss than to cause her to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fend her stand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Which is best? To snub a person be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause they don't dress and act as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">do, or to explain to them why other</seg><seg type="columnLine">people snub them." Then she turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lawyer, with a cynical smile. "For</seg><seg type="columnLine">shame, Mr. Maynadier, to let a protege</seg><seg type="columnLine">at large in such a comic kit." Disney</seg><seg type="columnLine">was standing open-mouthed at all this</seg><seg type="columnLine">discussion about him, and glancing over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his clothes in an earnest endeavor to</seg><seg type="columnLine">locate the exact difficulty with them. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">him they seemed the acme of correct-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. Maynadier's denial that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything to do with the purchase of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">raiment, brought the question from Dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney as to whether Maynadier also</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought them bad, upon which Nondas</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke in again, as though she had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided to take complete charge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">misguided ex-laborer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bad! It's a sartorial crime! I've a</seg><seg type="columnLine">golf necktie in my locker that I'll let</seg><seg type="columnLine">yon have; sorry I haven't shoes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waistcoat, too. Come along." Disney</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at her trim little figure, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his corpulency, and a smile covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face at the thought of his being able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pour himself into anything of hers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's the way to talk," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Pat me right. I was a bonehead to</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow myself before asking somebody."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he caught sight of the canehead</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the cuff-links, and asked: "But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow - wow s are pretty, aint they? Look</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, and here, and here," and he point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed proudly to the trio of dog's-heads,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which looked as though he were en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deavoring to advertise a brand of ale.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nondas heaved a sigh as she saw them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and resignedly remarked, as she escort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed the big fellow off to the locker-room :</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I dare say they'll take them</seg><seg type="columnLine">back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Left alone with Maynadier, Laura</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a sniff, tossed her head, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked to the door through which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others had gone, giving a final look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the retreating form of Disney, as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge bulk moved down the hall; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she turned to Maynadier with a smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">of compassion for Nondas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder if she thinks he's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duke?" Phipps raised his eyebrows</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly, and questioned what Laura</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought about it. "That odious person!</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a Duke!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't say he was," returned May-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nadier. "I merely asked you what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, that person is no Duke; on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you may depend," and Laura dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed of Disney's chances for royalty</seg><seg type="columnLine">with another toss of her head. Then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to Maynadier, and with a pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced change in tone and manner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked: "What sort of a person is Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reade?" The lawyer's answer was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as to inspire Laura with a terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">love for the furnace-tender, but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the thought of the millions which</seg><seg type="columnLine">went with him, and millions are very</seg><seg type="columnLine">attractive to an American society wom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ; there is always the haven of the di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vorce court, if the bringer of the for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune becomes unbearable for any reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever; beside which, there's ali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mony, and--but Maynadier was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribing Reade to her, so she awoke to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Reade's a boy with his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">crammed full of nonsense he's got out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of society novels, written bv men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">call cotillions 'serines,' and think we still</seg><seg type="columnLine">use dance cards. His language is so cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">496</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREEN BOOK ALBUM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rect, one thinks he's going to apply for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a position as butler." The lady ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned as to whether Reade was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duke, but was told that the promise had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been made that that gentleman was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain entirely incognito for a time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She pleaded, but in vain, for was May-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nadier going to throw away the chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his twenty-five thousand a year for</seg><seg type="columnLine">acting as mentor and cicerone, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be paid only on the condition</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the incognito was to be absolute?</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And that's what I wanted to tell you,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went on. Then with an enthusiasm</seg><seg type="columnLine">which no one would have accused him</seg><seg type="columnLine">of, but which in a real man would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared blase, he added: "We can af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford to marry now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, can we?" There was such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">total lack of any kind of expression in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her answer that any other than Phipps</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maynadier would have been stunned</seg><seg type="columnLine">but to him it was like so much water on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a duck's back, so he continued:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll live in London, and I can dou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble my salary by favoring the trades-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and contractors who supply the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Walshire estates. He wont be able to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything without me, and you can jolly</seg><seg type="columnLine">well believe I'll be the real Duke," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he advised her to have her mother an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounce their wedding for the following</seg><seg type="columnLine">month ; but Miss Laura was in no hurry</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it. Again she was in her air-castles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the real Duke, odious as he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly be, for she hadn't the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt that Reade would search her out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now that he had money, and she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly make him think he was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only man in the world for her. No;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Phipps Maynadier, in her estimation</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been all right until she had the pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent opportunity thrust before her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't seem terribly keen about</seg><seg type="columnLine">our marriage, somehow.

Pve</seg><seg type="columnLine">known you too long. However,"--and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent over and kissed her very gracious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly and considerately--"there." She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled out of herself by this action of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his: He raised his hands, as though not</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing how else to account for this</seg><seg type="columnLine">unwonted action on his part. "Well, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to want it. Personally, it's an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">awful bother to be sentimental. I'm not</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to it. I like you because you've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense." Had the little god of love been</seg><seg type="columnLine">present, he would have doubled up at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this remark. "You know how to preside</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a dinner table; you look pretty, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're not the kind that gets talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">about.'*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> God love the lovers among the snobs!</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely no one else does, and they need</seg><seg type="columnLine">sympathy, for they can't see themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">as others see them. Laura was again</seg><seg type="columnLine">far away from her present surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, but he went on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But sentiment! That's the sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing would make me marry a chorus</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl!" He patted her shoulder, which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in itself, was a great concession on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">part, considering he expected to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">her his wife. Then he told her to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">along to her aunt, as he wanted to ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">range visitors' cards for the Duke and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his friend. The mention of the Duke</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought her back again, and with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ingenuousness at her command, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquired when she should meet that</seg><seg type="columnLine">party, but he evaded the question clev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erly, and strolled off to the office. Laura</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood a moment in thought, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">starting off on another of her trips in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clouds, as she moved in the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion whence her aunt had gone, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was confronted by Reade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That gentleman, with his knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dress of society people, gleaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his studious perusal of novels, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">borrowed a riding-suit, and thus was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a half-bad looking proposition. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">least, so thought Laura, as she gave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little start upon seeing him, realizmg</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she would have him all to herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment at least. Reade's surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">at thus coming upon the object of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">adoration, was even greater than hers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his love/was real. He stood for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, unable to speak, and then col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lected himself enough to ejaculate:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Miss Lanvale--Miss Lanvale!--Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you remember me?" She endeavored to</seg><seg type="columnLine">control her feelings, but only half suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded, a fact which was not at all ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent to him, however.</seg><seg type="columnLine">SNOBS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">497</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes--I--do--remember--you! But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it can't be! It--can't--be!" By the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time she had completed the sentence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had regained control of herself, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was playing her part admirably. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly gasped with joy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After all these months--and you re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member a poor workman? Oh, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard to believe!" The assurance with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which she accepted his statement, set</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on his feet in a cloud of fancy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I've often thought of you, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">those pleasant hours I spent in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shops." He caught her up quickly on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was just an hour and twelve min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes." He was fairly beside himself, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly knew how to proceed, and Laura</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not giving him any too much as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistance. She was thinking--thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard; how to land him surely before</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone else came along. Finally he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued in an agitated tone: "I've been</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking of you for six months, Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lanvale; dreaming of you, but you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were Miss Lanvale, and I was only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor mechanic in the shops." Laura be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came virtuous in an instant; almost in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dignantly so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You think I am like that?" and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reproof in her tone cut him like a knife.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That a paltry thing like social position</seg><seg type="columnLine">should make any difference to me?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reade was confused, and naturally put</seg><seg type="columnLine">his foot in it at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But she--a lady I met last night--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he became doleful at the thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what Nondas had said to him, "said you</seg><seg type="columnLine">spelled Society with a double 'S'." Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beauregard entered on the stairway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and taking the situation in at a glance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained quietly out of sight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twain, on the lower step. For a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laura was nonplused by his remark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then brightly turned to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is not my fault if I am in what</seg><seg type="columnLine">other people term 'society.' It is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man and the woman themselves, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">one must look to." Now assured that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had guessed the situation correctly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Beauregard discreetly left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, smiling calmly. She could trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">her niece's future in her hands, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">what she had seen and overheard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you care nothing for what a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's father might have been ?" Reade</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">asked excitedly, and she shook her head</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all the assurance in the world that</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a trifling thing as ancestry should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have any effect whatever on her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whereupon he proceeded to enlighten</seg><seg type="columnLine">her about his father's very humble ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istence, and of his own low beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slow rise, with long hours and hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, arguing that he must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad to have thought of her as he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done. Laura had begun to purr softly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to herself by this time, as she felt things</seg><seg type="columnLine">were drawing rapidly to the proper cli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">max, and the smooth query of hers as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to why he should term it madness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">elicited his statement that even now he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in another man's clothes--a riding</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit, which he was not even able to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">properly, as he could not sit astride a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse, so he had been obliged to walk to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the club.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, this is the first time I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever been in a decent house. I've lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the slums all my life." Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to her suddenly, as even now his</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence needed an explanation. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you think I'd have dared to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">into this club if I were what I was when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you met me ? No! I'm going to England!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've had some good fortune." Then sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly he turned again towards her, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">his love swelled higher. "If I had money</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to--" But he terminated his</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech shortly, with a rueful expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. "But, no! It's madness." Laura</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke most encouragingly to him, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was supported by the thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the millions of pounds sterling, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's enough to make any society wom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">an courageous, and he turned again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">noting the expression in her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you mad, too ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She beamed 011 him with all the beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty at her command, and fairly dazzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">him into a lover's unconsciousness. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">love everything that is beautiful--even</seg><seg type="columnLine">madness."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started again to tell her of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">love, but caught himself, much to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappointment. Then grasping her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands in the height of his ardor, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked if he might see her again that</seg><seg type="columnLine">day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've a box party to-night at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opera house. If you come to my box</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the acts--Box D--" It was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">498</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREEN BOOK ALBUM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Reade could do to control himself, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he managed to make a mental note of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the letter, and releasing her hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked where Maynadier might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found, confiding to her that these were</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maynadier's clothes he was wearing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She made him promise not to say a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word to Maynadier about her, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised a question in his mind, but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">stilled that very easily, and then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed the way to the office, where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might find the lawyer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He bent over her hand as he took it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his, and repeated the box letter.

Laura,</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing with a very self-satisfied smile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">congratulated herself on her triumph,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for she felt it was inevitable now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she should become the Duchess of Wal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">X</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the midst of Laura's reveries her</seg><seg type="columnLine">aunt entered, going hurriedly to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''So that was the ducal bird, eh? He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">really very presentable, although he</seg><seg type="columnLine">talks like the hero of 'Junie's Love</seg><seg type="columnLine">Test.' " Laura turned on her aunt se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've been listening!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, dear, I have; and I congratu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">late you; you've got brains!" Laura</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pleased at that and answered:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you shall be my chaperon</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a whole London season, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will pay for all your frocks." What a</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy it is to anticipate all the pleasures</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life, and to be able to spend millions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even before they are yours. How many</seg><seg type="columnLine">have lived on that very exhilaration."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're as sure of him as all that?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her aunt's tone made Laura slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You say you listened. What do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think?" Mrs. Pen thought a second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then suggested the possibility that</seg><seg type="columnLine">if Reade wasn't a born fool, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">know she had read the dailies, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would naturally suspect his identity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laura was trembling from excitement</seg><seg type="columnLine">by this time, and pleaded with her aunt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to secure a marriage license at once.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Use my first name--make it Mary</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lanvale. And his name--now -- is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Reade."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And his first name?" Laura gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her aunt blankly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you'll have to know, to get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">marriagei license," and there wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">much consolation in the elder woman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone. She had strolled to the door, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now saw Disney talking to Nondas</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parkyn in one of the other rooms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turning to Laura, she asked her to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">nice to them for a minute or so, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">find out Reade's first name, calling</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nondas in. Nondas came, followed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Disney, now wearing Nondas' black</seg><seg type="columnLine">knit tie, of which he seemed very proud.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laura fairly beamed with joy, and Non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">das expressed surprise at this unwonted</seg><seg type="columnLine">change in the Lanvale family.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've been thinking," said Laura,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"how silly it is for us to be cross with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one another." Nondas had a flash of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of something underlying this</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech of Laura's, but passed it over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she remarked, complainingly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you wont laugh at my jokes!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here was Disney's chance, so he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, so he entered the conversation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, go on, Miss Nondas; be friends.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're both nice girls, and you oughta</seg><seg type="columnLine">get along with one another." Laura</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew herself up perceptibly, but did</seg><seg type="columnLine">her level best to unbend, so as to follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">her aunt's instructions. Nondas, mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, had turned to Disney in wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, but smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How did you learn my first name,</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man?" Disney nodded his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the direction of the office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's on a typewritten list over</seg><seg type="columnLine">there." Nondas turned to Laura with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And he calmly informs me that I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">posted for non-payment. That's grati-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude for you. And look at the tie I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him! Look at it!" Disney threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened to become a contortionist that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might carry out this instruction, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laura gave a slight glance, in order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">please Nondas. "It's made a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">man of him. I'm going to take him into</seg><seg type="columnLine">town now, and buy him some ready-</seg><seg type="columnLine">made dress clothes." Disney's coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">SNOBS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">499</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tenance beamed even more than ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this statement, and he shook all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she said: "He's coming to the thea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tre with me to-night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Am I?'* he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you? Well, rather. I wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">miss seeing you in a box in dress</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes for the first time--no!--not for</seg><seg type="columnLine">something! Besides, you may be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duke! Who knows?" Disney was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most caught off his guard, but he as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembled himself, as he fairly chortled:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ha! Ha! Ha! Me! A Dook!" Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned to Mrs. Beauregard, appeal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly. "Now, you look like you oughta</seg><seg type="columnLine">know something about Dooks." That</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady felt flattered by this compliment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even though it had come from a person</seg><seg type="columnLine">with whom she couldn't bring herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to associate, and she answered, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">with pretended humility:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, how should I know anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Dukes?" Disney looked at her a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because you've got that 'Did-</seg><seg type="columnLine">God-Make-You-Too' expression about</seg><seg type="columnLine">you--" Mrs. Beauregard almost fainted</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this, but managed to hold herself to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether for the good of Laura's cause,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Disney went on: "So I leave it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">3'ou. Do I look like a Dook?" The an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swer being rather long in coming, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Beauregard hardly knew what to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say when cornered this way, Nondas</seg><seg type="columnLine">took up the reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Most Dukes don't look like a Duke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They don't have to, being Dukes." Dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney turned to her a moment, until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could fairly grasp t,he meaning of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentence, and then repeated his ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, pointing to the chaperon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I leave it to the lady there," but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "lad}-" was apparently not at all at</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know enough about them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say." Disney gave her another glance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you wait till you see my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend; then you'll know." He pouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost like a spoiled child, and smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">inwardly, as he added: "I think it's all</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolishness not saying which one of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the Duke. It's no fun for me, 1 can</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you," and he listened to see how</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would accept his remarks. Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parkyn came to the front with a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">tit-bit--namely:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Mr. Disney has heard that Dukes</seg><seg type="columnLine">aren t respectable," but she was inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupted in the course of her remarks by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hurried entrance of Bradley Fair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fax, who was in a fever of excitement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rushed to Mrs. Beauregard, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking that usually calm lady off her</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you seen him? I just saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Phipps Maynadier. Blood will tell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Pen," and he almost jumped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his glee in having seen the "Duke."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Beauregard almost committed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">faux pas in a query to Fairfax, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laura stepped conveniently on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">aunt's feet, and she turned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">younger one:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eh, my dear?" Then realizing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">near-blunder, added: "Oh, yes," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">subsided. But Fairfax was all impa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tience that his announcement hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused more enthusiasm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's the young Duke. He's with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Phipps now. Haven't you seen him?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boldly Laura stepped to the front, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">commandingly told a white lie, tinged</seg><seg type="columnLine">with gray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. What's he like?" Fairfax gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">her a look almost of scorn, that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be so weak as to ask a question</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Like a gentleman, of course. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">could he help it, with such blood be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind him?" Nondas, ever ready to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">a remark with a quip, opined:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He might have let it remain behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Most of them do." Disney, anx-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ious that the deception, innocently</seg><seg type="columnLine">started by Fairfax, should not be cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rected, went directly to Laura and Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beauregard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No! But Buck looks the part. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">did I tell you? Oh, what a shock!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Buck!" exclaimed the sensitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laura, and visions of "Buck Reade" on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her marriage license flitted before her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'"Sure!

" Then turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Fairfax, having learned what she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">desired, she asked if he were going</seg><seg type="columnLine">500</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREEN BOOK ALBUM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">back to town, and invited him to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them. As Laura passed, Nondas</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled and volunteered the informa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that she and Disney might see</seg><seg type="columnLine">them at the theatre. Laura's expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly indicated that she was over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelmed with delight at the prospect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't look so pleased," added Non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">das.

Don't forget we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">pals," and he allowed him to go. Fair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fax joined his women friends, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed out without so much as turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">again to say good-by to Nondas and Dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney. He stood watching them a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. Then suddenly to Nondas, point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing after the retreating trio, he said-:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''They can't see me with field-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glasses." There was a slight pause as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought over the events which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">just transpired, and then he blurted</seg><seg type="columnLine">out: "Oh, I'm not such a fool as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">look," and the tinge of bitterness in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice made Nondas raise her eyes with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an expression which had more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">sympathy in it, but he was looking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other way and missed it. He looked aft-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er the others a moment, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say, why do you bother with me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Nondas?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked up at him, this time with</seg><seg type="columnLine">another expression, and then glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">past him, down the hall-way, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fairfax and the ladies were just going</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to their car. Then her gaze came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to him, and she looked him square-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly in the eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because, I know what it is to be an</seg><seg type="columnLine">outsider, too</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the opening performance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Man and Superman," coming direct</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its long New York run, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the very best credentials in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world to the local society leaders.

Consequently the opera</seg><seg type="columnLine">house manager and the company man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ager were reaping a golden harvest, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lolling back in their office chairs, smil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing serenely, while The World--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Society World and His Wife--thronged</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boxes and overflowed into the or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chestra chairs, all agog for the awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">immoralities with which Mr. Shaw was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reputed to have crowded his scenes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No member of the exclusive set was</seg><seg type="columnLine">better qualified to lend dignity to a box</seg><seg type="columnLine">party on an opening night than Bradley</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fairfax, and here he was, with his lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle friend, Miss Milly Chasserton. anx-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ious to shock her young mind; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Milly, having been very properly</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought up in the midst of the social</seg><seg type="columnLine">set, had a mind which refused to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">shocked by any such mildly immoral</seg><seg type="columnLine">play as this of the Irish wit's. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time, she gave Mr. Fairfax to</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand that she was very nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it. Naturally, he was pleased.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were standing in the passage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, back of the boxes, waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laura and the others, and Fairfax</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beginning to get impatient, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither he nor innocent Milly wished</seg><seg type="columnLine">to miss any of the performance. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">midst of their worries, who should come</seg><seg type="columnLine">along but teasing little Nondas Parkyn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, Milly was one of the society peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple with whom Nondas was acquainted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of course she was greatly shocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think that such an innocent little</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing should be in the company of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wild young rake as Bradley Fairfax.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are they allowing you out with</seg><seg type="columnLine">this Mr. Carfax?" she asked. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentleman, irritated enough at seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nondas again so soon, was made doub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly so at the evident twist she had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">his name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know my name is Fairfax!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nondas gave him the most surprised</seg><seg type="columnLine">look in the world, and really appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">injured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Indeed, I know nothing of the kind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How can I?

"You should see some of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends," and her hands went up, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though in horror. "One of them wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bright pink tie and sky-blue spats.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oh, he's no sort of a person for you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, this Mr. Fairfax, here." Milly</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at a loss how much of Nondas'</seg><seg type="columnLine">nonsense to take seriously, but her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was absolutely expressionless, as was</seg><seg type="columnLine">her voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rilly? How shocking! Are you one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the party, Nondas?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes--a party of two.

She brought out the final</seg><seg type="columnLine">word with a bit of spite which blended</seg><seg type="columnLine">well with the word. Fairfax, given as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been during the afternoon, to boil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with rage, came very near excelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his previous efforts, for he was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence of ladies, and felt that to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">way would attract disagreeable atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in such a public place. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he managed to deny to Nondas, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">severalth time, that Disney was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend of his, as that individual rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">into their presence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nondas never did anything by halves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when she had made the threat in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the afternoon that she was going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have Disney attired in evening dress,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she knew whereof she spoke. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now a sartorial dream, and his full</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt front made him look like a sloop</seg><seg type="columnLine">running before the wind. The outfit</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fairly correct--the best Nondas</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do, anyway, without being actu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally present at- the trying-on proceed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings. Disney saw Fairfax the moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had edged himself into the space,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rushed for him with outstretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, grasping Fairfax's unwilling one</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmly, as usual.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, there you are, old pal." As</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as Fairfax could release himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he started Milly upstairs for their box,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fairfax whispering to her, in an indig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nant tone, and endeavoring to explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">why this rude man should have had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temerity to even speak to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nondas and Disney, left to them-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">selves for a moment, she looked him</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, and was about to express her sat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isfaction at the metamorphosis, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she discovered the dog's-head cane, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that killed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's that for?" He looked at it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then at her; there was a half smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he gazed at the stick rather affec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionately, and then he looked sheepish</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he caught the glance in her eye. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor fellow was doing his best to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">good with her, and he seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting in wrong with every move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I dunno." He turned the cane-head</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, so as to get a glance at all sides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gain time to think. "Not much</seg><seg type="columnLine">good, 'cept to knock dust out of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">trousers," and he proceeded to put it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to that use. Nondas grasped his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">to put a stop to this, as she feared some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one might be looking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dress trousers aren't supposed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">dusty. Anyhow, the head annoys me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">A brilliant idea occurred to him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hoped to save himself again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It matches my cuff-buttons; see?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again he displayed the smaller ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jects.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then get some new cuff-links," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said calmly and almost coldly. His dis~</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointment was keen at this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't care for the design?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">More to make him feel a trifle more at</seg><seg type="columnLine">eiase than from real interest, she ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amined both the head of the stick and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buttons, and then smiled up at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you can't discard the cuff-</seg><seg type="columnLine">links just now, but you'll have to choose</seg><seg type="columnLine">between that stick and me." Disney</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave her a close look to see if she real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly meant it, and caught sight of Fair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fax descending the stairs from the up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per box, to learn whether the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">members of his party were coming, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">he grabbed him again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here, pal; wait a minute." Fairfax</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to get away, but Disney had al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready proved himself the stronger one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the two. I'm going to make you a</seg><seg type="columnLine">present. Here!" and he held the stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. "Have it!" The sight of the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrified Fairfax, and Nondas sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed a smile as she saw his face, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed him try to pull away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Disney and the stick. "Oh! It's a nice</seg><seg type="columnLine">cane! Have it!" and he made the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">502</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREEN BOOK ALBUM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">take it. Fairfax held it gingerly, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the thing were some dangerous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive.	. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ' One doesn't carry a stick with even-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing dress, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not?" returned Disney. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">might he rude to a newsboy, and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotta have something to protect your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self with. Take it along,"--as Fairfax</seg><seg type="columnLine">endeavored to return it. Seeing his ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forts of no use. the latter started oft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking the object with him, and Disney</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Nondas turned their backs to laugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him. The moment they had done so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fairfax propped the stick against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of the corridor, and then disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared. When their laughter had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased, Disney found himself getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentimental.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That'll always be the way when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask me to choose between you and any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else." She looked at him with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile about the corners of her mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's a pretty thought. Set it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow music." He was taken back for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, but returned bravely to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fray. He had started now, and was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to be stopped by any frivolous</seg><seg type="columnLine">speeches of the young woman upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom he had set his heart. If she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">content to accept him, not knowing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">real station, all the better for both of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in the future.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It wouldn't make any difference to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me what you asked me to give up--I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">give it up!" and his eyes expressed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">longing sentiment, which she saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then give up trying to be senti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's no use try in' to dodge it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Nondas. I'm gone on you--clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">daffy." She looked at him with the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a physician giving serious advice to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a patient.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When did this malady first make its</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When you blew in last night. I said</seg><seg type="columnLine">to myself: 'Henry/ I said, 'That's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl,' but she broke in on him before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could go any further.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mustn't talk about me to people</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hardly know." She paused a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her eyes grew more serious in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">genuine manner, and he watched them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see if there was any hope indicated</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for him. "Look here, my boy," she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she talked as though he were much</seg><seg type="columnLine">younger than she--so he was, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience of the life they were encir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cled by. "You're an oddity, a rarity, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I do like you, but if you'll give me some</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason for joining you in this vein. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be obliged." He shifted uneasily from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one foot to the other, and felt foolish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Oh, I'm nothin' to write home about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know. But I've got a chance to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody in the world now--and I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to be." Then he looked at her</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. "I'm not pin-head enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think a girl like you is goin' to fall for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me as I am now\ All I want to know,"--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he paused the fraction of a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">to gain courage-- "are you strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">for anyone else?" She was amused at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his method of inquiry, and gave him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quizzical look.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Evidently an old Greek phrase,</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning: has anyone seized upon my</seg><seg type="columnLine">young and tender affections--that it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Disney had gotten almost to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">popping point, and was dead serious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't josh me. Miss Nondas. Be se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rious for a minute. I'm in love. There!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was out, and the surprising part of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that Nondas was not taken off her</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet at the abruptness of the declara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion ; she was really interested in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow, and knew him well enough, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though their acquaintance had been but</seg><seg type="columnLine">of twenty-four hours' duration, to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would say what came into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind at the moment. This was one fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture about him which she admired.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was none of the smug society</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner about him. Instead of being all</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the surface, he was "all over," to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">an old expression of hers. She an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered him coolly and easily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, being in love's happened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">everybody. Don't act as though yours</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a special case." But he was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ever anxious about it now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You're not crazy about anybody, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?" From anyone else, such question-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing would have been resented, but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to enjoy it from him.

"Unless you cared for some one</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and I'm gunna make you care for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some one." She didn't pretend that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't understand, but came right to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point at once, as was her custom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can't do that by parroting these</seg><seg type="columnLine">snobs you see about you.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, how can I make you love me?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was highly amused at this unusual</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of love-talk from a man of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">caliber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know myself well enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, but as a general rule, love for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man comes from some thrill which</seg><seg type="columnLine">wakes up a part of a woman that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know existed.

Mrs. Beauregard</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on her way to the upper tier of box-</seg><seg type="columnLine">es, followed by Laura and Fairfax,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they joined Milly, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching the rise of the curtain. "Reade</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed anxious to see you about some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. Where've you been since this</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At a tailor's, gettin' a new front,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he displayed himself more fully in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dress suit. "They were made for an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other feller, but he fixed it over for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Kinda nice, aint it?" Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of what Maynadier had said re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garding Reade. "What's the matter with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buck?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know. Shall I tell him where</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are when he comes?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure! Sure!" and he turned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knob on the box door. "See you later."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Lots of people here to-night I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to meet, Disney," said Maynadier,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he cut him off in the middle of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't do it, Chief! Got no open</seg><seg type="columnLine">time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm afraid I'm not earning my sal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ary. Can't I do anything for you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nope!"--with a grin. "Yes, you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">--some time--when you've a spare min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute," and he smiled again. "You might</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise me up on how to give a woman a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrill," and he disappeared into the box,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving Maynadier in blank amazement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the close of the first act of "Man</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Superman" the spaces back of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxes were filled by their occupants</seg><seg type="columnLine">and friends of theirs who came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">various sections of the house to gossip</seg><seg type="columnLine">and comment on the play. Fairfax was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly displeased that no more of im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morality had developed in the first act,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but lived in hope that the second and</seg><seg type="columnLine">third acts would develop something</seg><seg type="columnLine">really devilish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Beauregard and Laura, left</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone in, their second tier box, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking vainly about the house for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of Reade, for he had not as yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">honored them with his presence, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">both the ladies were beginning to fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">504</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREEN BOOK ALBUM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that some other siren had captured the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prize. Keade, however, having learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Disney was in Box B, was at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment knocking 011 the door and Dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney opened it to his friend, still holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dog's head cane in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hulloa, Buck! Come ml' Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to Nondas, asking her if she</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't remember his friend, which she</seg><seg type="columnLine">admitted. Reade bowed to her, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to his chum, his voice hoarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">with excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can I speak to you a minute, Hen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ry--in private?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Sure!

You're the only friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">I ever had, and I'll go to soak for you</seg><seg type="columnLine">any time you say the word." Reade was</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched by this bit of sentiment, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost broke down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Henry, you're--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can all that, Buck!

Disney slapped him on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back again. "Well, then, between</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and me, you needn't come into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">box. You know how I feel about that</seg><seg type="columnLine">young lady--and she likes met ME!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Common old Hen Disney!

Buck; how do I</seg><seg type="columnLine">look in the soup and fish?" and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted about, that his chum might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a at,h"i?

Well, run along, Buck; Fm busy,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he started to open the box door</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, when he remembered the cane in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand. He looked at Buck, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether he ought to inflict the cane on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chum, and then remembered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise to Nondas. "I'm going to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">you a present,'' and he handed Reade</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stick. "There! That's some cane!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Have it 1" and before Reade could utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">a word of protest at this generosity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Disney had ducked into the box and</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed the door on the privacy of Non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">das and himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reade gave a final look at the box</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, heaving a sigh as he thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big-heartedness of his old-time</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend, and then wended his way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper boxes, looked along at the let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters, and knocked at Box D. The door</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened, and Laura came out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're here--at last?" she sighed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've been anxious, too?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">queried. "Oh, you don't know how hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is for me to realize. Yesterday I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mechanic, with no hope of being any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else--and now--" and he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at himself. "This is the first time I ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore evening clothes. Do you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how I happened to have them for to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night?" and he explained to her the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cident of the preceding night, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">determination to sit where he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">look at her, even though he might not</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak. "And now, everything is</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed," he went on. "This is my night</seg><seg type="columnLine">of glory," and he lapsed into his society</seg><seg type="columnLine">novel style. "I don't know whether you</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood what I wanted to say this</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon--but I've enough money to</seg><seg type="columnLine">support a wife now, and I can offer her</seg><seg type="columnLine">some kind of a position--so it's no in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sult to tell you I love you." Laura acted</seg><seg type="columnLine">her part very well, simulating the neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary surprise at this avowal. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt desperate. "Oh, I knew it was mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness," and as she saw he was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">scared away again, she took him up</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">SNOBS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">505</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe I'm a little mad, too." Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she positively beamed triumphant upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. and took him off his feet. "And it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a beautiful madness." Reade kissed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands in his delight, but was seen by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Beauregard, who emerged from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Box E. He stepped back into the shad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ow, as though he had been caught in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">guilty act. and Laura rushed to hide her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head in sudden diffidence on her aunt's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aunt Phcebe, will you forgive me/'</seg><seg type="columnLine">she cried plaintively. Aunt Phcebe gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">her an expressive pressure which Reade</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't see, and very calmly asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the matter was--who this gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was. Laura, in her most ingenuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner told auntie that he had asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to marry him, and--and--she want-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed to. Then came the introduction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her fiance to her aunt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And who is Mr. Reade," asks Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pendleton Beauregard, with all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">dignity so required of the better and</seg><seg type="columnLine">most exclusive set.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was a mechanic last night," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">he. getting down to facts at once. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed Miss Lanvale through our</seg><seg type="columnLine">shops six months ago, and I have loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">her ever since, and she--" Coy little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laura hung her head. "And now I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">an income, and I have asked her to be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come my wife." Mrs. Beauregard was</seg><seg type="columnLine">diplomat enough to take in the situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a glance, so she patted Laura's cheek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Silly, romantic children! And what</seg><seg type="columnLine">are you going to tell Phipps Mayna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dier?" Reade's curiosity was aroused in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What has he got to do with it ?" Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beauregard smiled blandly at his ignor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance, as she quietly remarked :</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing, except that he's been en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaged to Laura for the past two years."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reade was plunged into the depths of</seg><seg type="columnLine">despair in an instant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, if I had only known!" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laura became her old self on the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant, before she had time to think, ask-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing testily:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What difference does it make to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's my friend," said Reade. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have told him I loved you, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that all would have been fair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">square." Mrs. Beauregard gave him a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">look which would have done credit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the regulation stage mother-in-law.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Young man, that speech belongs be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the covers of a book--and paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">covers at that. There is no fair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">square in love-making." Fairfax en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered from the stairs leading to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower boxes; the former at once noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reade, coming up to him beamingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">very apparently looking for an intro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh--er--I don't believe I've had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">honor," he began, when Mrs. Beaure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gard very ungraciously turned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men--for she had seen the approach of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fairfax, and deliberately turned her</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, so as to avoid the necessity of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">troducing him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Reade--Mr. Fairfax." Fairfax</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought he was exceptionally clever</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he realized that the other was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">troduced as "Mr. Reade," because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished to remain incognito, and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">acknowledging the introduction, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked, with a smile and a rising inflec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, accompanied by a slight raising of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eyebrows to let the others know he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the circumstances: "Quite so,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shook hands with whom he sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed was a member of royalty. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung about for a moment, endeavoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">to enter the conversation, Mrs. Beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">regard getting more nervous until she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could stand it no longer. Her lips tight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened perceptibly, as she turned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intruder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Please get my fan in Box D. Brad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley," she ordered, and when he had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">on that mission, she devoted her atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to Milly, who had been hovering</seg><seg type="columnLine">about expectantly. After a moment's</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, during which she could find no</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason for sending the little minx off on</seg><seg type="columnLine">an errand, she snappingly said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Miss Chasserton--Mr. Reade," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Milly was in the seventh heaven of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, for this was the first member of</seg><seg type="columnLine">royalty she had ever seen. But Milly</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a very knowing young Miss, also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Reade?--Oh. yes," with a sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestive smile, which was far from be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing lost on either Laura or Mrs. Beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">regard, and she continued, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">to monopolize the conversation: 'And</seg><seg type="columnLine">how do you like the United States, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reade?" Laura was becoming pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">506</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREEN BOOK ALBUM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">voked, and bad been thinking of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">excuse to rid them of Milly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Milly, I think Elsie wants to speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you/' Miss Millv, however, was a far</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiser bird than Fairfax, and would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be limed: so she started on the conver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sation with Reade again. The other</seg><seg type="columnLine">women were about to give up the situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in despair, when Fairfax returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the information that Mrs. Beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">regard's fan was nowhere to be found</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the box. Then he saw it in her hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Milly giggled at this, and turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fairfax, to let him know that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been wiser than he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Laura told me that Elsie wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak to me, but I knew that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only pulling my leg." Mrs. Beauregard</seg><seg type="columnLine">held up her hands in horror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Really, Milly, you are giving me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great shock." But Milly turned to Reade</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, Mr. Reade knows what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean." and the conversation drifted in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dangerous channels, which led them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to close the topic of who was the real</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duke, with Reade trying to hide his</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's no use trying to hide it, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reade.

"We can tell a gentleman from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a--a--a--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bounder," said Milly, supplying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word which Reade was afraid to utter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reade, beginning to take in the situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. became almost tragic about it, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked if they really believed he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Duke, and turning to Laura, asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">if that was the reason why she had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed love for him. Laura, thinking he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only covering the real situation, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to deceive the others, pushed Milly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into one of the boxes, while Mrs. Beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">regard took Fairfax away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene, and Reade uttered a cry of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spair. as he began to realize that Laura</seg><seg type="columnLine">cared nothing for the man--only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">title. Laura fully to convince herself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked him point-blank:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you the Duke?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Reade saw his chances of claim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the woman to whom he had unre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servedly given his love, slipping from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his grasp, he became almost frantic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No! No! No!" he answered, in re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponse to her direct question. "And if</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is why you are willing to marry</seg><seg type="columnLine">me--" Laura broke in again, still fear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful that she might commit some horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">blunder, if he really were the Duke, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were testing her; yet she was also fear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful that he was telling the truth. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">position was a desperate one--for her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"How can you insult me so--Oh--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oh!" and she was on the point of weep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing real tears this time, but reserved</seg><seg type="columnLine">them for later on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You--you didn't think I was?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleaded.

How can you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And you love me for myself ?--Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laura! Laura!" and he took her in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms, holding her tightly, while Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laura heaved her whole frame in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendid imitation of a paroxysm of</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion, that he might know' the depth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her grief and love, he soothing her</seg><seg type="columnLine">the while. Bernard Shaw never wrote</seg><seg type="columnLine">a neater lying comedy than Laura was</seg><seg type="columnLine">exemplifying behind the doors of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxes.

He drew closer then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with clenched teeth, and spoke in a cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Laura!" Reade released her quietly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he heard her name called, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone told him that something wfas about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to happen, and he turned to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">newcomer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maynadier!--I'm--I'm sorry!

"Why, you utter ass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she's done just what Disney expected!</seg><seg type="columnLine">She thinks you're the Duke. Love? You</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool! Get out of the way," and then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to Laura, as tawing paid enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to Reade. But that young man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on his dignity in a moment, resent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the tone in which Maynadier ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed Miss Lanvale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't come any of your cheap,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ajax - defying - the - Lightning' poses</seg><seg type="columnLine">around here/' said Maynadier turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to him. "Miss Lanvale is engaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me--and you're not wanted! Get</seg><seg type="columnLine">out!" He whirled Reade out of the way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and took the surprised Laura by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm. Even now she was not sure but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the whole thing was a test for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sincerity, and yet she couldn't under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand how Maynadier could know any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of it, and if so, how he could lend</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to the trick. "Now, Laura, don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a silly chump of yourself, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the whole town laughing at you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The other fellow is the Duke." Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheeled about at Reade again. "You've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got a cheek, pretending you're a Duke!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was too much for Reade, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he not, in every way he possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">could, without breaking faith with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chum, led people to believe that Dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney was the titled one. At all events, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscience was clear, and if others had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the error, it was through no fault</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his, so he turned on Maynadier in</seg><seg type="columnLine">white heat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, you snob! You cad! Do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think the whole world is as base as you ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don't you believe there is one decent</seg><seg type="columnLine">motive, one pure thought, one unselfish</seg><seg type="columnLine">love in the world?" Maynadier smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly at what he was pleased to call</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reade's fine heroics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't be an ass, my boy! Do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">sincerely believe Miss Lanvale prefers</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to me--'for yourself alone,' " and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gave emphasis to the phrase, "as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady novelists have it?" Reade's honest</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind could conceive of nothing else</seg><seg type="columnLine">than her love for him, for he had so</seg><seg type="columnLine">idolized her in his dreams and thoughts,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that he couldn't believe it was only his</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed title she had been angling for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She loves me," he almost wailed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She loved me when I was--" and in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second of hesitation his voice became</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitter with anguish, "a mechanic in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shop." Maynadier laughed at him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt like thrashing the man on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot. Only Miss Lanvale's presence, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knowledge that she would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged into undesirable publicity pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vented him, but his temper was fast get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting beyond his control, and he realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. He swore to Maynadier that Laura</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not of the world he believed in;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she was true and faithful to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for himself, and dared Maynadier to</seg><seg type="columnLine">test her; to tell her he was not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duke; even to get Disney to tell her;</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use any method necessary to disabuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mind of the idea, and ended by de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claring flatly that he was not the Duke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that Disney was. He turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laura.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe in you. I'm only doing this</seg><seg type="columnLine">to satisfy him,"--pointing to Maynadi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er. "Wait! Disney is downstairs. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring him here," and he was off to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">his friend. Immediately he was gone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laura turned on her fiance, accusing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him of trying to fool her for the pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose of seeing how she would act if she</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought Reade was not the Duke. Thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">do drowning men cling to a straw. May-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nadier smiled at this idea of hers, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he termed "very ingenious, but a trifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">shopworn," and was about to attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to convince her beyond all doubt, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reade started up the stairs with Disney.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he heard them coming, he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was a big temptation to you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laura, and I wouldn't stand in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, if he was the Duke. You could</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry him like a shot; it would be vel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vet for me." Then the two friends were</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the scene, Reade excitedly hurrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">Disney.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, tell them, Henry; tell them</seg><seg type="columnLine">which one of us is the Duke!" Disney</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed unmistakable annoyance at be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing thus dragged from the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman he loved, and called upon to</seg><seg type="columnLine">confess to a secret which he was most</seg><seg type="columnLine">desirous of keeping, and accused May-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nadier of being responsible for the sit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">508</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREEN BOOK ALBUM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">uation, all of which the latter denied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">goin? on to explain how he found Laura</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Reade, and that the lady had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed her love for Reade, simply be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause she believed him to be the real</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course you wouldn t blame any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one for preferring the Duke of Wal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shire/' he added, as a final shot, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">which made all three of them wince, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Disney was inclined to be pugnacious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his fighting spirit was several de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grees nearer the surface than when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped on the landing. It began to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a storm, with Maynadier in the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You say you wouldn't blame anyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">for preferring the Dook of Walshire."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Disney looked straight at Maynadier.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"D'ye" think it's very nice for me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that, being what I am?" and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">diplomatically tried to cover his posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. "I've got to look out for my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs." He turned to Laura in an off-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand manner. "It wont hurt you to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little guessing." She looked at him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusion of mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you--you can't be the Duke!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Disney was inclined to emit a guffaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">of laughter at this, but wisely refrained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's a good way for you to look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. That's the way I want all of you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look at it." Maynadier was entirely dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gusted with the whole affair by this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, and strode directly to Disney, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I resign! Get somebody else</seg><seg type="columnLine">for your five thousand pounds a vearl"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Disney was surprised at this, but' May-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nadier kept on. "I'm not going to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Lanvale deceived into a marriage</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a fellow she doesn't care a rap</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. I've photographs--signed photo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graphs, to prove who's the Duke," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned to Laura as he added: "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait until to-morrow; I'll show them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you!" At this threat Disney was in dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">may. for he wanted above all things, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep his position a secret until he should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be convinced of Nondas' love for him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, the man; until he should have an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity to work up that thrill. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleaded with the lawyer to maintain the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secrecy agreed upon, stating that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would tell Miss Lanvale if she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise not to repeat it, but that he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> iti love himself, and didn't want a girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">to marry him simply because he was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Dook/' Maynadier told him to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead, and he would answer for her si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, then ; I'm the Honorable Hen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ry Lancaster Morpeth Orth, Knight</seg><seg type="columnLine">Commander of the Bath, Knight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garter, Knight of the Thistle, Baron</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fitz-Cairn, Earl of Flint and Dook of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Walshire.

You're not playing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a game?

Reade, watching Laura as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she caught Disney's arm, and the varied</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressions which had come over her</seg><seg type="columnLine">countenance, awoke from his stupor, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she turned to him, and asked if this</seg><seg type="columnLine">were true.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course it is; I never said I was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duke; and I'm not!

Cruel as Laura could be,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when thwarted in any purpose, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately sorry in her own, narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">little way for what she had said, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">added, impulsively: "Oh, I'm truly sor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ry for the part I've played. But it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a temptation--the first lady in</seg><seg type="columnLine">England! That means an awful lot to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman.

Reade's head</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in his hands, and his frame was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking with his broken feelings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She turned apologetically to Mayna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dier, asking his forgiveness, but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentleman cared little for what had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened, so long as he was still to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, and eased her mind in a moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This brought Reade out of his stupor</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and he sprang at Maynadier like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a panther, shouting that if he couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have her, no one else would, and espe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cially not Maynadier. Disney caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">SNOBS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">509</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Reade, and pulled him off the other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling him to steady himself, but Reade</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beyond control of his passion now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again threw himself on the lawyer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was ready for him this time, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw him to one side easily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't come trying any of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanic muscle on me, my boy. I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">box. Don't forget that! Handle a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">like you!" and he •smoothed out his coat</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Reade had mussed it up, turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Laura to explain more of the past</seg><seg type="columnLine">events. Reade was positively a maniac</seg><seg type="columnLine">by this time; he had lost all reason; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only thing he knew was that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been deprived of the woman he loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the man he hated, and he was eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">for vengeance in whatever form it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">handiest. As he recovered his balance</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Maynadier had thrown him, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You devil! You rotten, sneering</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil! Handle that! Handle that!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardly realizing it, he had grabbed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog's-head cane which Disney had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given him shortly before, and as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke, brought it down on Maynadier's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. The latter staggered under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushing effect of the blow, and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">backwards towards the stairs, leading to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lower boxes. Laura and Disney</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed to his aid at once, the latter do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing some tall thinking at the same time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Reade, awakened from his mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness by the act, stared dully into va-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cancy, and dropped the stick where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood. Then he looked to see what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">result was of the blow he had given.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laura was hysterical by this time, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">screaming loudly, but Disney took her</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his arms, and carried her from May-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nadier's side to the first tier of boxes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">assuring her that her fiance was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunned, and that his heart was all right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The occupants of the other boxes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused by the disturbance, came rush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into the corridor, and Disney im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately commanded the situation to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best of his ability, assuring every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one that Maynadier would soon regain</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness, but telling no one what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had occurred. Nondas strove to comfort</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laura, but that was an impossibility. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the midst of the excitement Reade ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared, endeavoring to get out, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laura saw and stopped him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You sha'n't get away! If he dies, I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">make them hang you!" she shouted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Disney was thoroughly disgusted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time. In his varied career he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen so many knocked out, and had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">such good experience telling whether a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had a chance for his life or not,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could not conceive why such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbance should be made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're like a lot of damn-fool kids,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he shouted. "He's not going to die. Keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">still about how it happened, Miss Lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vale, or Maynadier'll lose his job with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me--twenty-five thousand a year; don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget that!" That statement quieted</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. Disney turned to Reade, as people</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to flock in from the orchestra</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. "Get out, Buck! Quick!" but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advice came too late, for his escape was</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocked, and he could only cower in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner. Fairfax was of course on</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand to see what the matter was, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had picked up the walking-stick, recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized it as being that which Disney had</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to force on him earlier in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening, and took it downstairs to</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the others were grouped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Laura, having been quieted by Dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney, Nondas turned to him, and in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper, asked him if he had done it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laura now started to explain to Non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">das about the Dukeship, and Disney</seg><seg type="columnLine">peremptorily shut her up, reminding her</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her promise. Laura then bethought</seg><seg type="columnLine">her of Maynadier, and rushed up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs to him, while Nondas turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reade, who had slunk back in a corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you've made a pretty mess of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, my boy," she whispered to him, "for</seg><seg type="columnLine">one day of ducal splendor." The fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was Disney's friend made her</seg><seg type="columnLine">endeavor to protect him by whispering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though she couldn't refrain from letting</seg><seg type="columnLine">him know how she felt about it. "Brace</seg><seg type="columnLine">up now! It's your time to be heroic and</seg><seg type="columnLine">noble!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She turned from him to see Fairfax</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing in with the blood-stained stick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shake it at Disney, as he shouted:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's murder! Murder!" This asser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion threw all the onlookers in a panic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the tinsely arrival of Sergeant Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nutt in his policeman's uniform quelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, as he asked what the trouble was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Murder's the matter," shouted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling Fairfax, still holding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">510</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREEN BOOK ALBUM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stick. "Look here," and he pointed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prostrate form of Maynadier. to</seg><seg type="columnLine">which McNutt rushed. Disney turned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">roughly to Reade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You fat-head! Get out!" but Reade</seg><seg type="columnLine">only stared at him stupidly. McNutt re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and immediately seized Fairfax,</seg><seg type="columnLine">asking for the truth, whereupon that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentleman showed him the sticky and</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNutt saw the blood upon it. Fairfax</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to Disney.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's the man! It's his stick!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh. damn that stick!" grunted Dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XVI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reade groaned in despair, as he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the turn affairs were taking, and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to explain, but Disney grabbed him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">hustled him through tho. crowd, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted to him to get a doctor. McNutt</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized Disney, to prevent him follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Reade, who made good his escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time. He held the stick up to Dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney, asking if it were his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was. But I don't want it any more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You can have it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You wont need it where you're go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing." said McNutt. "Come along with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me!" Disney questioned McNutt's rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son for this move, and the Sergeant</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated assault and battery, with intent</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kill, was the charge. Then, turning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fairfax, he asked that gentleman if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen the act. Laura, having re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned from Maynadier's side, started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to explain, but Disney again reminded</seg><seg type="columnLine">her of her promise, and McNutt in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed him that he was intimidating a</seg><seg type="columnLine">witness, and asked Laura for her name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, you make me weary!

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNutt had made up his mind that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would get Disney, so he turned to Fair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fax. note-book in hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You prefer charges against this</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.'' Fairfax nodded.

They preach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctrine of dramatic art for art's sake only. They maintain</seg><seg type="columnLine">that art should be unhampered by literary demands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the manner of presentation is of vastly more impor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance than the subject matter.

And</seg><seg type="columnLine">to that end a movement is on foot for the building of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge stadia, one in Berlin, another in Munich, patterned</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the great Greek amphitheatres, where the spectators</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be permitted to sit on four sides of the enclosure and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the action of the drama will transpire on a stage in the cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of the arena.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meantime, the college stadia at Harvard, Berkeley and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Syracuse, and the classic productions being given in them</seg><seg type="columnLine">from time to time, have attracted the attention of Rein-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardt. To be able to give a series of huge performances in</seg><seg type="columnLine">these arenas is the director's ambition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The classic and romantic drama is being fostered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">American universities in a way which puts Europe to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blush," he observed. "Americans have never allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">romanticism to be shoved into a decline. It is strange and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful, that the new country should foster the highest</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideals of expression--with a return to the greatest classic</seg><seg type="columnLine">art."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the proper avenue is opened, very little persuasion</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be necessary to bring Reinhardt to this country. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">advent will mean much for American drama. The wizard</seg><seg type="columnLine">has spread his power over Austria, Russia, Scandinavia*</seg><seg type="columnLine">and England already. Only France has turned a cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder to him, chiefly for the reason that the taste of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Parisian public seemed to tend solely toward uncom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">promising realism.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is something so sweeping and vital about his work</seg><seg type="columnLine">that descriptive and critical writers have turned away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their task, awed by the bigness of what they beheld. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven great productions are Sophocles * "CEpidus Rex,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shakespeare's "Midsummer Night's Dream," and "Ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let ' produced in Berlin, "Sumurun," a bewildering Oriental</seg><seg type="columnLine">pantomime set to music produced in the Savoy Theatre in</seg><seg type="columnLine">London, "The Miracle" produced at the Olympia in Lon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don, Strauss' "Rosenkavalier" produced in Dresden, and Of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fenbach's "Die Schone Helena" produced in Munich.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sumurun," the choreographic drama by Frederick Freska</seg><seg type="columnLine">MAX REINHARDT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">now running in London and destined to be brought to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States, is a production on a somewhat smaller scale</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the director favors. Yet what it lacks in size and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope, it makes up in wonder of detail, for it overflows</seg><seg type="columnLine">from curtain to curtain with perpetual mysterious charm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">faithfully Oriental, voluptuous, magnificent, and artistic to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last degree. It was this over-abundance of correct and</seg><seg type="columnLine">exquisite detail combined with the histrionic and scenic</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope of a classic, which made Berlin condemn Reinhardt's</seg><seg type="columnLine">production of "Mid-summer Night's Dream" as over-baked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They thought it too elaborate, too extreme. But the wizard</seg><seg type="columnLine">is full of surprises. He gave them "Hamlet," with simplic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity so exaggerated that the very chilling hardness, the em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phasized drabness of the tragedy stirred them to wonder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as the high lights of the fantastic comedy had blinded</seg><seg type="columnLine">them with their color.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HIS GREATEST</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"CEDIPUS REX" marked the high-water line of Rein-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardt's power. To have beheld that tragedy was to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been transported to early Greece, to have become for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment a Theban, non-combative as it were, but never-</seg><seg type="columnLine">theless part and parcel of the great moving spectacle itself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were neither curtain nor foot-lights to disturb real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity. On the exposed stage rose a massive palace, with steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">which descended into the circus-ring itself. Bereft of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trappings of an ordinary stage, it became a spectacle in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the public outside the arena seemed to acquire a</seg><seg type="columnLine">personal interest. Surprise after surprise stirred them as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they sat watching. They were cast first in Stygian dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. Out of the gloom altar fires suddenly flamed up, burn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing splendidly on either side of the palace, kindled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">naked youths who seemed to emerge from among the audi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence itself. When the plague-ridden mob flowed into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arena from behind the benches of the public, those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked on were thrilled by the magnificence of their attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if they, too, were Theban citizens plunged headlong into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cauldron of passion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And all the while, if one looked sharply,, one might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed the god of the machine, a middle-aged, broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldered man, baton in hand, standing at the main en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance, conducting the shrieking mob as if it were an</seg><seg type="columnLine">orchestra, and releasing it in divisions as if it were an army</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and the little man with the baton was Reinhardt, com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mander-in-chief !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS A DIRECTOR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> AS A director he is strenuous and indefatigable.

The critics had looked upon 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and had written that she had the J</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes of a Spanish beauty. This pleased 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">her because she had Spanish blood in j</seg><seg type="columnLine">her veins, and she realized how theatre- I</seg><seg type="columnLine">goers dote upon the exotic, particularly j</seg><seg type="columnLine">that which exudes the fragrance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">orange blossoms and the gardens of the j</seg><seg type="columnLine">South.

Reutlinger, of Paris, assisted her</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her campaign for publicity by send-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing photographs of the Nethersole eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">to all corners of the world.

In the Koran, XX, we find "on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that day the trumpet shall be sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we will gather the wicked together,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even those having gray eyes." Ibsen</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew this, when he said that Hedda</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gabler had ''steel gray eyes that express</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cold, unruffled repose." He described</seg><seg type="columnLine">no other character in his plays in just</seg><seg type="columnLine">this language, for none of the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the keen, calculating1 desire for sin</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was Hedda's.

One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these is called "Stage Tradition." and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other "Baneful Innovation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the actor--appearingas"Hamlet,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">for example--should make use of cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain "business" that some former ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor had employed, he is pretty sure to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be told that he is wanting in origin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ality, and called a conventional bore;</seg><seg type="columnLine">while on the other hand, should he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">535</seg><seg type="columnLine">536</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREEN BOOK ALBUM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">follow his own inclinations in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter, he is certain to be informed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he is a dangerous iconoclast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">' The fact is, actors go on from cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tury to century digging pitfalls for</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other! Any actor with a spark of</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligence is certain to find some</seg><seg type="columnLine">original way of enacting a scene. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, slavish imitation is irksome. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">considers that it is best to do it his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own way--as he feels it--rather than</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow the plan of some actor who has</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone before. When enacting a classic</seg><seg type="columnLine">role, his way--at first--is never</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered the best way, the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, even though it may happen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the one that ordinary intelligence</seg><seg type="columnLine">would dictate! After a while, the pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lic gets used to his method: it be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes a "tradition." Then another</seg><seg type="columnLine">actor comes along: he feels the char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acter differently, discards the "busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness"--and is soundly berated. So it</seg><seg type="columnLine">goes on from age to age.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                           I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After observing this condition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs for many years, Max Beer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bohm proposed an admirable and</seg><seg type="columnLine">practicable plan to kill off--once for</seg><seg type="columnLine">all--this tradition bugbear. It is his</seg><seg type="columnLine">notion that the classics, like the seal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fisheries, should have a "closed sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son." He said:/* 'Hamlet,' 'Romeo,'</seg><seg type="columnLine">and 'Macbeth/ will never 'live again,'</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless all managers, metropolitan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suburban, and provincial, enter into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a solemn compact not to revive any of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the classics for a period of thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After such a time had passed, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "traditions" would be forgotten,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the actor left to his own inven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. The performance of a classic</seg><seg type="columnLine">role would then be judged on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">merits, and not by plaster-cast tradi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. For it is, as the same writer</seg><seg type="columnLine">says, a lamentable fact that, "when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a play becomes a classic in drama, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceases to be a play; it becomes a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mere pretext for comparative criti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cism. The play is dead. The stage is</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded with ghosts; every head in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the auditorium is a heavy casket of</seg><seg type="columnLine">reminiscences. Play they never so</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisely, the players cannot lay these</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumambient ghosts, nor charm</seg><seg type="columnLine">those well packed caskets to empti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">w</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It may as well be admitted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tradition incumbus has never em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrassed me--for I have never al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed it to sway me a jot from my de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign. The method that Miss Marlowe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and myself have employed seems en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely feasible; we have found it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fit our purpose most admirably. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">making a Shakespearean revival, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have purposely cast tradition over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board. We have first made a thorough</seg><seg type="columnLine">study of the drama and its characters</seg><seg type="columnLine">--have made our own version, elim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inating this and then that, till we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have, with an honest devotion for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the author, arrived at what we con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sider a good, workable scheme. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have not bothered our heads with</seg><seg type="columnLine">what this actor or that actress did in</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain scenes, but have, in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">case, invented our own business. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">are equally responsible for what may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be considered good--or bad--in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plays as we present them. To say, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">one writer has, that our version of</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Macbeth" was a mosaic, made up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the best traditions, culled from</seg><seg type="columnLine">other plays, is far from the mark: it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a bald misstatement of fact, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brainless heresy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is a certain free-masonry of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stage which the theatre-going</seg><seg type="columnLine">public knows nothing of: certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside information, known only to ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors. The auditor will often discover</seg><seg type="columnLine">that certain speeches, which seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him valuable, have been elimi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THRALDOM OF STAGE TRADITION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">537</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nated. It is more than probable that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from time immemorial, the actor has</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that these speeches obstruct the</seg><seg type="columnLine">action, that they put a halt to the on-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush of the scene. It was found in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisdom of the old actors--the wis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom, be it said, of experience--to cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">them out. But because some old actor</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut certain lines or passages, has never</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored our judgment, for we have,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in each case, followed our own dic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tates in the matter. We have never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been lured into accepting stage busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness simply because some one else</seg><seg type="columnLine">did it; yet I can state with absolute</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth and honesty, we have never, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">making a revival, kept one line in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">prompt book which was not Shake-</seg><seg type="columnLine">speare !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This devotion to the Bard has lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">to singular results. Some seasons ago,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had "Much Ado About Nothing"</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our repertoire. When playing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Washington, we were soundly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rated for having made "an unwise and</seg><seg type="columnLine">senseless cut at the end of the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">act." Well, it happened that what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">writer complained about, did not be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">long to the text; it was an interpola-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of some old actor. Even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">effective, I would not have used it;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but, as it happened, Miss Marlowe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and myself were thoroughly of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinion that Shakespeare had com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted the scene in a masterly man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner. The scene as the Bard ended it, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">as follows:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Beatrice: Yes, as sure as I have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> thought or a soul.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Benedick: Enough, I am engaged;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I will challenge him.

It has long been a stage</seg><seg type="columnLine">"tradition" that the elopement scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">should end with Shylock crying out:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"My daughter! Oh my ducats! Oh</seg><seg type="columnLine">my daughter!" This speech belongs</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Salarino, and is so allowed him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our version.

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">former times he was enacted by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">low comedian who appeared with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">red wig!

This is a smasher! Yet there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a line--not the vestige of a tra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition--as to how Burbage, a fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">actor with Shakespeare, read a line</seg><seg type="columnLine">538</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREEN BOOK ALBUM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">or impersonated a role.

When I first appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Hamlet, one of the critics sound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly berated me, saying, finally, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Richard Mansfield's rendition of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Melancholy Dane, was a much more</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfying impersonation." It did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter to this ''policeman of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drama," that Mr. Mansfield had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared as Hamlet! But, had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">writer stuck to Burbage--of whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing is known--he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been on safe--and classic--ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is not at all unlikely that very</seg><seg type="columnLine">much of the stage business of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plays which has become a tradition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came down to us from the days of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shakespeare. William D' Avenant--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reputed son of Shakespeare--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">who knew the Bard as a boy, was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voted to his memory. He was a close</seg><seg type="columnLine">associate of Thomas Betterton, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great actor. D'Avenant coached Bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terton in the roles of Hamlet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henry VIII, and basing his knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the plays on instructions</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had derived from Taylor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Lowin, who gained their knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge from Shakespeare himself. Tay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lor and Lowin, were two important</seg><seg type="columnLine">players in the Bard's company, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is naturally to be inferred that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">imparted to D'Avenant, Shake-</seg><seg type="columnLine">speare's own characterizations, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that other actors, who followed Bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terton, passed on these traditions</seg><seg type="columnLine">from age to age.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is hardly possible, however, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shakespeare could have countenanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the "business" which was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">use on the English stage during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">past two hundred years or more. One</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the strangest bits of this--in force</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the time of Garrick--was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">an actor appearing in an heroic role,</seg><seg type="columnLine">should appear before the audience</seg><seg type="columnLine">with two enormous plumed feathers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was strangely thought that these</seg><seg type="columnLine">plumes imparted dignity! Another</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange tradition was, that an actor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when presenting such roles, should</seg><seg type="columnLine">wear buskins--the inference being</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently, that Jhese coverings for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the feet "affected the motions of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart." The occasion for this thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">is difficult, at this time, to imagine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hamlet," above all plays, is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one which has been most hedged</seg><seg type="columnLine">about with strange traditions. Gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rick, for instance, used two miniatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the scene with the Queen, in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hamlet says, "look upon this picture,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on this." The use of these two</seg><seg type="columnLine">miniatures became stumbling blocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the actors who followed Garrick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henderson, his immediate successor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventured to improve the business of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scene, by throwing away the por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trait of Hamlet's uncle, whereupon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garrick's admirers fell foul of him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They argued that as the great Gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rick had not done so, he should not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have desecrated traditions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Desirous of pleasing his patrons</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he next appeared, Henderson</seg><seg type="columnLine">retained the miniatures in his hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was then ridiculed by the Garrick</seg><seg type="columnLine">faction, on the ground that if he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">right at first, he was necessarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong, the second time. Henderson</seg><seg type="columnLine">was also chastised for not using his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat as did Garrick, when seeing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghost, and was also grilled for omit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting to upset a chair in his agitation</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the legs bent inwards so that it top-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pled over at the slightest touch. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garrick upset a chair, Henderson</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have done so!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Garrick, himself, had violated many</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the traditions, but saw fit to ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THRALDOM OF STAGE TRADITION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">539</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">here to the old custom of drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sword when Horatio wished to</seg><seg type="columnLine">detain him from following the ghost.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But when the latter said, "I am thy</seg><seg type="columnLine">father's spirit," he made a respectful</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow and put up his weapon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">t$h</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">~</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the most stubborn tradi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions known to "Hamlet," was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomfoolery engaged in by the Grave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">digger.

For ages the First</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grave-digger obtained his greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">effects by divesting himself of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half dozen waistcoats. When this</seg><seg type="columnLine">waistcoat business was abolished in</seg><seg type="columnLine">1831, Leigh Hunt expressed his ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proval; and seven years later, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Compton appeared in the role to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charles Kean's Melancholy Dane, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Drury Lane, his refusal to revive this</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolish buffoonery, was commended</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Alfred Bunn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Is is rather surprising to learn that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the business of ridding the Grave-dig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger of his waistcoat, was a reform that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had many opponents.

It was only up to a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">time ago that an actor dared appear</seg><seg type="columnLine">in any version, except that made by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colley Cibber. Indeed, the theatre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">goer had come to imagine that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cibber version, was merely a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrangement of a text. This was far</seg><seg type="columnLine">from being the case. Whole scenes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were introduced by Cibber, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to be recognized as from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain of the Bard. Consequently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when actors of later time restored</seg><seg type="columnLine">the original text they were severe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly criticised for eliminating cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain passages, which were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shakespeare's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is strangely the case that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">actor or actress who is condemned in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one age for his portrayal of a Shake-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spearean role, is looked upon by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next as having given an ideal imper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonation. In this particular, it may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that many consider that which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is old is ever golden, and that which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is new, is gilt!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I recall a peculiar instance of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty girl may be of the very humblest</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenement origin and yet good material</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the stage manager.

In addition</seg><seg type="columnLine">to being a Chorus Man he was a book</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent, he addressed envelopes, he can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vassed for all sorts of things and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">never seemed to have an idle moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have never seen another like him.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have known Chorus Men who did both</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these things and were comparatively</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable.

It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">may also be mentioned that as he does</seg><seg type="columnLine">little or no work outside the theatre,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his apparel, which is part of his stock</seg><seg type="columnLine">in trade, has little wear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When playing a long engagement in</seg><seg type="columnLine">any city, the Chorus Man is generally</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be found from four o'clock in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning until noon or one o'clock in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon in the hall bed-room of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">theatrical boarding house.

I had a partner by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name of McCarthy. We were present-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing an Irish act, "Grogan's Chinese</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laundry," a rough sketch, with more</seg><seg type="columnLine">or less slapstick in it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The late George Knight, a famous</seg><seg type="columnLine">comedian of the German school, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">556</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the green book album</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">producing a piece entitled "Over The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garden Wall." In the piece there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the part of an Irish woman, called</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bridget. Mr. Knight happened in at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the theatre where my partner and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">were appearing. In our sketch I</seg><seg type="columnLine">played two parts, one of a man,, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other of an Irish woman, with broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">accent and robust physique. Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knight met me after the performance</seg><seg type="columnLine">and asked me who was the third per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son in the act. I said there were only</seg><seg type="columnLine">two people, but he remarked that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was referring to the woman. I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him I was playing the woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Knight offered me the part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Irish servant in his play. I ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cepted, as it meant a decided step in</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance for me in a professional way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The playing of this Bridget part is</seg><seg type="columnLine">how I came to originate my character</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Aunt Bridget, which has since be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come more or less well known to</seg><seg type="columnLine">theatre-goers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aunt Bridget was a hit. The broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">humor of the part, the wholesome,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean, if sometimes rough, manners</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Celtic dame, appealed to audi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ences. My part was made bigger and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bigger, until it became of almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal importance to that of the star.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I remained with Mr. Knight for sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral seasons. Meantime I became ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quainted with a young fellow in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">company, John C. Rice, whom you</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably recognize as one of the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">popular of present-day vaudeville ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tists. Rice and I decided that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have a play written for our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves, utilizing and elaborating the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">same character of Aunt Bridget</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been so successful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The play was written and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">called "Our Aunt Bridget." It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">success. Then followed a series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Aunt Bridget" pieces. Two of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">were "Aunt Bridget's Baby" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Our Happy Little Home." These</seg><seg type="columnLine">plays lasted for a good many seasons</seg><seg type="columnLine">and firmly established me as a de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lineator of broadly burlesqued fem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inine types.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would seem that I might right- '</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully claim to have been one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first successful female impersonators,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but, unlike the present-day perform-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers in that line, there never was any '</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery as to whether or not I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">man or woman. My voice is not what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you would call soprano. It is pitched</seg><seg type="columnLine">in low baritone. But the fact that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">played my parts in a spirit of broad -</seg><seg type="columnLine">farce seemingly made them all suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the series of "Bridget" com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edies, I appeared in another Irish</seg><seg type="columnLine">farce,, with a woman as the central</seg><seg type="columnLine">character. This piece was "Mrs. j</seg><seg type="columnLine">0*Shaughnessy, Wash Lady." Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">came "The Widow Dooley's Dream,'* 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">another broad farce with the familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">Irish woman, with engaging smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">and generous figure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After Widow Dooley, I took a fly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing tour in vaudeville, playing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aunt Bridget character in a mono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">logue. Then I went back again to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aunt Bridget as a revival. After a sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son or so, in which I flitted in and out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vaudeville, I finally appeared for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Klaw &amp; Erlanger as a headliner in</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced vaudeville at the New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">Theatre. I played about thirty weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">for K. &amp; E. and then went with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece called "The Top o' th' World."</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was a very successful produc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and continued as a popular at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traction for a number of seasons.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After this venture, I was engaged for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a principal part in "The Mimic</seg><seg type="columnLine">World."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LUXURY OF LAUGHTER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">557</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was at this time that I became</seg><seg type="columnLine">identified for the first time with Lew</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fields, with whom I have remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever since. After "The Mimic World,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was engaged by Mr. Fields to play</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the principal parts in "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jolly Bachelors," one of those tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendously big musical melanges. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained with this piece for two</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, and this season I became the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessor of another big part in Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fields' present successful production,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Never Homes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But. in every production with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I have been associated, wheth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er under my own or some one else's</seg><seg type="columnLine">management, I have always appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a woman--and a nice, large, fat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">good natured woman, in the bargain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Therefore, in more senses than one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I may truthfully say that I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">played nothing but fat parts.

Nature has cast me in a mould.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which if not exactly heroic, is at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid and substantial. My parts have</seg><seg type="columnLine">never worried me. It never has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary for me to fly to the pad and .</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pillow to supply any physical de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficiency when offered a fat role.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A young man hailed me as I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving the theatre, after a matinee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few weeks back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Monroe, I want to thank you</seg><seg type="columnLine">for curing me," said he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Curing you, young man?

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the most appreciative audience I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have ever faced.

And they will enjoy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and applaud all of these.

She was born in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yalta, Crimea, May 22, 1879. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">father was a chemist and botanist, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a deep and earnest interest in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">education of his daughter. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken to Geneva for her early training,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there she became a proficient player</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the violin. She returned to Yalta</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she was twelve years old and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there made her first public appearance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing a violin solo at aXhristmas en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tertainment. At that time she could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak her father's language, Russian,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but had a fluent command of German</seg><seg type="columnLine">and French. She studied her native</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue for a year and then entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conservatoire at Odessa to complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">her study of the violin. She took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dramatic course instead, acquired some</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience as a "super" under the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stanisloft'sky at the Artistic Theatre in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Odessa, and at the end of three years</seg><seg type="columnLine">won the gold medal at the Conser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vatoire. A year later she began her</seg><seg type="columnLine">career in earnest by becoming the man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aging actress of a company playing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the north of Russia, at Kostroma.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There she acted a long list of parts in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a repertoire that included everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">from tragedy to musical comedy. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to the south of Russia in 1901</seg><seg type="columnLine">to act with a resident company at Ker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. She spent the next season at Vilna,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then went to St. Petersburg, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">she acted many important roles, includ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Camille, Paula Tanqueray, Hedda</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gabler, Trilby, Magda, Zaza, and many</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, in a wide variety of Russian</seg><seg type="columnLine">plays.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mine. Nazimova, or Nazimoff, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was then called, was not the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manding genius of the company of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Russian players with whom she first</seg><seg type="columnLine">acted in this country; she came merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the leading associate of Paul N. Or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leneff, an actor who had enjoyed high</seg><seg type="columnLine">reputation in a country where the art</seg><seg type="columnLine">of acting is held in high esteem. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered herself OrlenefiPs pupil, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was an honor to her that she did. Up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on all who were capable of responding</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the thrilling appeal of that man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">acting, he exercised an unforgettable</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spell. He commanded his company like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a general: he flooded his plays with a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wonderful personality. She who acted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vis-a-vis with him in the important</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scenes of interesting plays seemed not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">only to reflect the power of the master</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the company, but to reveal a splendid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">power of lier own. She was strangely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and wonderfully attractive. The less</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">knowing section of the small audience</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which greeted the Russians gave most</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of its interest to the leading woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She was snuggling, squirrel-like, some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">times elfin, and often a pathetic figure;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and these things, conditioning her act-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing, attracted a special interest, for they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gave a bizarre touch to many things</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she did, and. coupled with her skill,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they set her apart from her associates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Invading America</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  THE Russian visitors had rather a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bitter time of it in that season of</seg><seg type="columnLine">578</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREEN BOOK ALBUM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">06.

The play had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been prohibited by the Imperial govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment because of its racial aspect, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Orleneff felt that that prohibition</seg><seg type="columnLine">would serve to awaken the interest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Russian Jews throughout the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He proposed making the play the chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">feature of the repertoire arranged for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his American tour. On this tour Mme.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nazimova acted as Leah, the daughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the watchmaker, in "The Chosen</seg><seg type="columnLine">People." as Regina in Ibsen's "Ghosts,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lena Lyadinser, the actress, in Her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mann Bahr's comedy, "The Starthe</seg><seg type="columnLine">TsariUa in Alexis Tolstoy's "Tzar</seg><seg type="columnLine">Feodor;" Zasa in Paul Berton's play</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that name; Hilda Wangel in Ibsen's</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Master Builder;" the landlord's</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter in Anton Tchekhoff's "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sea Gull," and the daughter of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief of police in Gogol's "The Re*</seg><seg type="columnLine">visor," or "The Inspector*" as it gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erally is called in this country. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">acting of Mme. Nazimova in all these</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts won her the greatest favor. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had great talent, but it was evident also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she had had great instruction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indeed, she was OrlenefFs pupil!

In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed, he continued to scrutinize my</seg><seg type="columnLine">work closely and enigmatically, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one role and another, until I finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to ask him not to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first time I ever essayed Ophe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lia was to the Hamlet of Edwin</seg><seg type="columnLine">Booth's lifelong friend and subse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quent manager and co-star, Lawrence</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barrett. I recall my determination to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress the girl, after her father's death,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in black. Why not? Polonius was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet cold in his grave? Laertes was</seg><seg type="columnLine">subsequently to don "the inky cloak"</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his sister? I thought my black</seg><seg type="columnLine">gown most effective; but when I ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared in it Mr. Barrett objected and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed, ordered me immediately to</seg><seg type="columnLine">discard it for a white dress.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined his company for "seconds," be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing cast for Gertrude before Ophelia,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emilia before Desdemona, and so on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Others who have played both parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">prominently in "'Othello" are Lillah</seg><seg type="columnLine">McCarthy (Mrs. H.

He asked for "two tickets for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fordham"--where stood the little cot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tage they had moved into with such</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride a week before--and having fed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to the ticket chopper, he sat down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the bench beside her, and tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason it out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What else can I think? I played that</seg><seg type="columnLine">part just as I've rehearsed it here at</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, and just as well as I can play it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bigger theatre didn't rattle me,'nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">being in New York, nor anything. I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">my best, I tell you. And what was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">result? The first time I tried, the stage</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">manager told me I'd have to be careful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or I'd get a laugh on it. The second time</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the girls in the wing did laugh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he had to threaten her with a fine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And all through the day, every speech</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gave, there was that same feeling in</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who listened to me--the desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">to laugh. Their faces showed it. Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't you see, there's only one expla-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation--and my understudy was down</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front with the part this afternoon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oh, I'll be canned to-morrow all right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she would not give up hope so</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily. This chance of a New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance meant too much to them all</seg><seg type="columnLine">--too much to her husband, to herself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to little Bimbi asleep in his cradle, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even to all their friends back there in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dubuque. Why, they had considered her</seg><seg type="columnLine">husband one of the greatest actors in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world, in Dubuque! They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded the theatre to hear him at</seg><seg type="columnLine">every performance. On his benefit night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had even blocked the street in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerness to buy tickets. Mr. Cktyborne</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, the great Mr. Claybome, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said to her with his own lips that once</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clyde obtained a hearing in New York,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the New York public would never let</seg><seg type="columnLine">him get away. Oh, it couldn't be that</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, on this first day, before he'd even</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a chance to show what he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her breath caught, and hurt, but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt her husband's eyes upon her, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cheerful smile never left her lips.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't you fret at all about it. Honey</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boy," she said, patting his cheek--to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great satifaction of the ticket chop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per, who had already sized them up as</seg><seg type="columnLine">honeymooners. "It's coming out all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, and you'll have your chance in</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York on opening night yet. Oh</seg><seg type="columnLine">yes, you will. Pets knows. You'll see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And to the casual observer, the events</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the next two weeks would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to justify her prophecy. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the understudy continued to sit in front,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was not, so far as the actors could</seg><seg type="columnLine">discover, ever called upon to rehearse;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the stage manager never again crit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">icized the leading man as harshly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">on that first day. In fact, he seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have taken a resolution to avoid criti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cizing him altogether, and lived up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, except on occasions when the prov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NEW LEADING MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">593</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ocation became too great. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would burst out with, "Earnestness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Edwards! Remember that a farce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comedy is played in one way, and a seri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous drama in another. Now if you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">make us feel that you are a modern</seg><seg type="columnLine">Romeo in love with a modern Juliet--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Edwards tried, but he couldn't. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">his efforts to avoid farce-comedy, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did. however, render the part neutral</seg><seg type="columnLine">toned, and one day the leading lady--•</seg><seg type="columnLine">softened by his alacrity in picking up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">handkerchief for her--told him kindly</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had greatly improved, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he kept on he might yet succeed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">putting it over. Edwards writhed under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scant praise, remembering how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other actors were accustomed to stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">around with awe-stricken admiration</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he created a part in Dubuque.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he shut his teeth grimly, and tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take the encouragement as it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant. After all, if a man had got into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way of over-rating his capabilities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was probably well that he should find</seg><seg type="columnLine">it out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And thank Heaven, they had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">canned him!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The play opened on a Thursday even-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, in a dog town in Connecticut, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the reach of New York reporters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and continued there through the week.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By the unanimous verdict of the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">daily paper, the opening was most suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessful, and "Darbell's Decision" was</seg><seg type="columnLine">destined for a long and prosperous met-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ropolitan career. But after the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">performance, when the stage manager</seg><seg type="columnLine">had finished supper with the editor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had written the criticism for him, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked down to the depot and sent off</seg><seg type="columnLine">a night letter to the Old Man--who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was detained at home with facial neu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ralgia--which read like this:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Play doubtful, but may get over.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran until after the holidays, and at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first of the year Mason decided to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">the company, headed by Miss Norman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a tour of the country, to play both of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Berson pieces. It was a triumphal</seg><seg type="columnLine">tour, but when the Pacific coast was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached, the leading man. Tom Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall, became ill. He struggled bravely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to continue his work but the strain was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too great. When Mason saw that Mai-</seg><seg type="columnLine">612</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREEN BOOK ALBUM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shall could not keep going he began a</seg><seg type="columnLine">frantic search for a man to take his</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. Just before they reached San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Francisco, he received a telegram from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berson, which partly reassured him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same time gave him more cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">for worry. Berson wired:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Am still looking for another leading</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> man, but in the meantime 1 will play</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the part.

He could not reach San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Francisco before six o'clock Monday</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening and would be forced to hurry</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order not to delay the performance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mason left the stage manager in charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of things and went to the station to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet Berson; he left orders that every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing should proceed exactly as usual,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Tom's substitute ready to play the</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of The Cavalier in case Berson</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to appear on time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half an hour before time for the cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain to be rung up, Elsie, her make-up</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete except for a few little touches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the door of her dressing room</seg><seg type="columnLine">and asked the stage manager if Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berson had arrived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he replied curtly.

In another thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds everyone about the stage knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Berson had arrived.

Then she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">saw a figure emerge from Tom's dress-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing room and come and stand in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wings. Dressed in the gay costume of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Cavalier, she could not determine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at that distance and in the dim light,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">how he looked. The bell tingled; the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">orchestra struck up the opening eight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bars and she tapped the floor with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">toe of her shoe. The stage was flooded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with light; the curtain went up and she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">started on, keeping step with The Ca-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">valier, coming from the opposite direc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The action of the play demanded that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she should not look up until within a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pace of The Cavalier, and that then she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">should utter a startled cry of love and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">surprise, but she had great difficulty in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">adhering to this course. Twice as she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">walked toward the center of the stage</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she tried to glance up through her eye-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lashes at the approaching author-actor,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but could see no higher than his chin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When she came within a step of him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she stopped, looked up, gave a gasp of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">genuine surprise and joy and fell into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the outstretched arms of--Butler, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spotlight man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When the performance was over,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mason and all the other members of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">company assured Elsie that she had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">never played so well, with such bril-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">liancy and life and buoyancy, that she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had never seemed so thoroughly carried</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">away by love for her art.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But an hour later, after the author</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had explained, for the tenth time, that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lie had taken the position of spotlight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man in order to study the technique of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the stage--so that he could write a play</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">especially for her, she admitted, smiling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through her tears, that her good work</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had not been due entirely to love for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her art alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Mason was the best man--with a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">MyJfort Successful Pay</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">^ Henry BIo^oiil</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT IS difficult sometimes, for a play-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wright to decide just which is his</seg><seg type="columnLine">best production, for the reason that</seg><seg type="columnLine">so many things enter into the equa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that he has to think for a while</seg><seg type="columnLine">before making up his mind. The box-</seg><seg type="columnLine">office is considered the best judge, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, and yet many authors have</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that their most deserving efforts</seg><seg type="columnLine">have not had justice at that supreme</seg><seg type="columnLine">and final court. However, in my case</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would not dispute its decision, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">quite agree that "Mile. Modiste" is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best stage product of which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have so far been guilty as author.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was written five years ago. and</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed "Checkers" and "The Yan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kee Consul." At that time, I was liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in a little bachelor apartment on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thirtieth Street, New York City. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">play and the musical comedy just</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned had both been very suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessful. and it was only natural that</seg><seg type="columnLine">something else should follow. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">613</seg><seg type="columnLine">614</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREEN BOOK ALBUM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">playwright who succeeds in one ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fort, does not have to go about look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for managers: they come to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And so it was in my case. One day I</seg><seg type="columnLine">received a call from Mr. Charles Dil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lingham. who asked if I would write</seg><seg type="columnLine">the book and lyrics for another mu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sical comedy. He told me that Mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">am Fritzi Scheff was under con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tract to him and that he wanted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">starring vehicle for her. I agreed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do the work, and after talking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter over with Mr. Dillingham and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madam Scheff, we decided to take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip to Europe together, for the pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose of gathering the right material</seg><seg type="columnLine">and putting it in shape in circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances that would make it agreeable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to all. Madam Scheff wanted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scenes laid in Paris as she preferred</seg><seg type="columnLine">the modern atmosphere and gowns;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so to Paris we went.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meantime, I had outlined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plot in my mind, and as we traveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, I began to fill it in. The situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, by the way, in which the poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">working girl is loved by the man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rank and wealth, is always a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">one for the stage, particularly when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man of high degree, in the end,</seg><seg type="columnLine">has to get down on his knees and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seech the girl to marry him. It never</seg><seg type="columnLine">fails to get the gallery, and of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you can get them, you've got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. In "Mile. Modiste," this idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">was used, and it proved a very suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessful situation. At that time, Mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">am Scheff did not speak English</seg><seg type="columnLine">very fluently, and I had to use lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guage to which her vocabulary was</seg><seg type="columnLine">suited. This is very evident in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manuscript, where the words, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">also the sentences, are noticeably</seg><seg type="columnLine">short. I wrote the lines as we went</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, and after I had finished a bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dialogue or a verse meant for her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would submit it to her to read ,* and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was anything in it that she did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not like, or to which her articulation</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not equal, it was cut out or</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed. In that way, the greater</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the book was written while</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were in Paris. The balance--with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lyrics--was finished at Saratoga,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I went to collaborate with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Victor Herbert on the musical num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I do not wish to give the impres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion that all of my dramatic efforts</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been as easily placed as was</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mile. Modiste." "Checkers," my first</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt at stage work, was not in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that class. It was written while I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my father's insurance office in St,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louis, and afterward, when I began</seg><seg type="columnLine">the business of trying to interest a</seg><seg type="columnLine">manager in it, I hawked it around</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broadway for three years, before find-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing one who was willing to give it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trial. Then this manager wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">put an actor in the title role who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">under contract to him, but as I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not think he was the right one for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">part, I refused the offer. I remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling George Broadhurst about it at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time. "What's the matter with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?" said he. "Are you crazy? Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you mean to tell me that you have re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused an offer to have your play pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced?" "What's the use," I argued,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"if it will only be a failure? Better</seg><seg type="columnLine">far, have no production." Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back to the business of ped-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dling it again, until it got to be a joke</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Lambs' Club. Whenever I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">in,, they would laugh and say:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Here's Blossom with 'Checkers' un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der his arm, as usual." But the wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was not in vain, for when Kirk</seg><seg type="columnLine">LaShelle finally did produce the play,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was an instantaneous success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then came "The Yankee Consul."</seg><seg type="columnLine">That, by the way, was not the orig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inal name. I had intended the hero to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a big, bluff, manly naval officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">who went about everywhere setting</seg><seg type="columnLine">things straight, and I had named it</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Lieutenant Commander." But</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Mr. Savage saw it, he said he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted it for a starring vehicle for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Raymond Hitchcock, and that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the Consul, which at that time</seg><seg type="columnLine">MY MOST SUCCESSFUL PLAY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">615</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was a secondary part, was the one in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he wanted him to appear, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked if I could build it up so as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make it the principal role. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">done, and the name changed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Lieutenant Commander," to</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Yankee Consul." I had got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea in the first place, from looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a Rand, McNally guide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">book. I was after some location re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mote and different in atmosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">from any that had hitherto been used</seg><seg type="columnLine">in comic opera, and finally hit on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hayti. Then I remembered that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabitants there were colored, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that wouldn't do, so I looked a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little further and found San Do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mingo. That had a Spanish ring and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so it was decided on. The choice</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved a good one, for "The Yankee</seg><seg type="columnLine">Consul" was successful and is still</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">This is aside from the subject of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my best play, but it has to do with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the process of building a comic opera,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and is an instance of the changes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">are made before it reaches the pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lic. The writer of musical comedy has</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything but his own way in the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction of the piece, and for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason it is the most unsatisfactory</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of effort. Personally, I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been very fortunate--not having had</seg><seg type="columnLine">any failures. But at that, the work is</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappointing for the reason that so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many practical things necessary to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the production interfere with the au-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thor's preferred idea of the book. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first place, everyone concerned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the piece has something to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its construction. Possibly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manager likes it and says he will</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce it, but he has a few stipula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions : he wants the second act laid in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palm Beach instead of the North</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pole, as you had originally written it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he has an expensive setting</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Palm Beach left over from some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that has just failed, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wants to use it instead of buying</seg><seg type="columnLine">new. Then possibly he will say to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you: "Now I have engaged So and</seg><seg type="columnLine">So because he does a wonderfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">funny fall that always makes a hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the audience, and I want him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the piece." It may be that "So and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bo can neither act nor sing, but just</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same you have got to put in</seg><seg type="columnLine">something for him to do. And so it</seg><seg type="columnLine">goes. There may be others on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manager's pay-roll who must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked after; he has contracts with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and must supply them with</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to do, and it is only nat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ural, of course, that he should expect</seg><seg type="columnLine">your vehicle to cover their wants as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as possible. And so it is neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary to make it over to suit their</seg><seg type="columnLine">various specialties and requirements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, after you have rearranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">the book to suit all the stipulated re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quirements, the time comes for re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearsal. After having made so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">changes, you feel that you would like</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have the piece appear as you had</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally got it together, and you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes. Not for long, though. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">manager is sitting down in front, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">book in hand. Suddenly he decides</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the pages between eight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighteen must be cut out. The author</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempts to protest, but it is of no</seg><seg type="columnLine">use. The manager doesn't even stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use a pencil. "Where's a pin--give</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a pin!" he cries. "There!" And be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore you have time to mention your</seg><seg type="columnLine">contract, ten pages of your book have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone to oblivion; the leaves are</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinned together--"cut"--and that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">an end to them. It's of no use to pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">test. Of course you can take your</seg><seg type="columnLine">manuscript and go home, but then</seg><seg type="columnLine">you don't. You remember that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have spent six months of your time</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the piece and that after all. the ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject is to see it on the stage, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">you let it go as the manager wants</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Then there is the stage manager</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the leading woman. Possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">they will not like your favorite</seg><seg type="columnLine">verses, and what's the answer? They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are cut out. Finally you come to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">616</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREEN BOOK ALBUM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">opening night. The leading woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">is thinking of her voice; the stage</seg><seg type="columnLine">manager is wondering if his choruses</seg><seg type="columnLine">are going to work properly, and, well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe the composer is in the house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then the orchestra puts on</seg><seg type="columnLine">double steam, and the lines are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last things that get any attention. So.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I say, the making of a musical com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edy is both complex and heart-break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, for the librettist, and the best he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets is the worst of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The writing of "Mile. Modiste"</seg><seg type="columnLine">took about six months' time. I usual-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly write the book, which takes about</seg><seg type="columnLine">three months, and leave holes for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lyrics. That allows three months for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the verses. The lyrics are usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">written before the music, though this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not always the case. Sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Herbert will say: "I have a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">air that I think a good deal of, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would like to have you work it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere if you can." and then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">go ahead and write the jingles to it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some of my most successful songs</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been written in this way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mile. Modiste" was written first in</seg><seg type="columnLine">pencil, as that is the way all of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">writing is done. And after comple-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in this way, it was dictated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stenographer. I do not make out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular scenario, but have a play</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly mapped out in my mind be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore beginning to write.

It is his purpose, also, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce "The Red Mill," later, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">London. This piece, by the way, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second musical play that I wrote</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Mr. Dillingham, in collaboration</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Victor Herbert, and I had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">near to naming it as my most suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessful work, for with the able aid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montgomery &amp; Stone it was a tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous hit from every standpoint</seg><seg type="columnLine">--popular, artistic, financial.

Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">it suffice to say that Modest is not Gab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">by's middle name. He does not believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you can paint the lily, or that any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one has anything on him. He is a strik-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing specimen of the genus Ego, and is</seg><seg type="columnLine">always willing and ready to stand or</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall of himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But notwithstanding all this, it did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not require the services of an expert</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be able to detect that our Hearty</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eater was flabbergasted.

His chubby</seg><seg type="columnLine">face had lost its usual human expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion and turned a dull pea green, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">GABBY GOES ON THE STAGE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could be seen with half an eye, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the mass of make-up.

And, as a result of this buoyant</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidence, he had succeeded in so dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">figuring his face that even I had diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culty in recognizing him in his new</seg><seg type="columnLine">disguise. But in spite of the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was disguised--and believe me, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a disguise--Gabby had turned pea</seg><seg type="columnLine">green.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gentlemanly anvil expert who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was acting as pianist, kept repeating</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opening bars of Gabby's first song.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He played it for perhaps a full minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the noise of Gabby's reception</seg><seg type="columnLine">died down and Our Plunging Vaude-</seg><seg type="columnLine">villian had an opportunity to show,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gait.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally, however, things did quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, and the operator of the ivories</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave Gabby his cue to break into song.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would be far better and more char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itable could we draw the veil of sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathetic obscurity over what followed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, jealous of our reputation as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">accurate and truth-telling chronicler,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we must proceed to dip deep the foun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain pen and set down all that came</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth on that day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During your lifetime, you have prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably noticed the manner of a child,</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to enter a room, to have a session</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a stern parent and a strap.

The fact that such an actor as</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Drew can go on season after</seg><seg type="columnLine">season, essaying "straight parts,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">proves that he is not only a master</seg><seg type="columnLine">technician but the possessor of a won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful personality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That it is more difficult, by far, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">play "straight parts" as compared</seg><seg type="columnLine">with what are known as "character</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts" is best shown in the salaries</seg><seg type="columnLine">that are paid to the two classes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">actors.

On the other hand, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight part" offers the actor little</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than the opportunity to create</seg><seg type="columnLine">a character. To what extent he may</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize and develop the playwright's</seg><seg type="columnLine">conception of the character is largely</seg><seg type="columnLine">a question of his own ability and</seg><seg type="columnLine">skill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The majority of leading roles in</seg><seg type="columnLine">modern plays are written as "straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts."

That</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the kitchen wings formed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only interior set; back stage near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, hung a wood drop.

Hanging from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling, in the center, was a Roches-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter lamp. That stood for border lights.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Along the front of the stage set a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-dozen bracket lamps with tin re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flectors. These were the footlights,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and many a time in similar places,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have I seen the swish of a woman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gown put out the whole business. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of the stage stood an old organ</seg><seg type="columnLine">with two stops, neither of which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slightest control over its wheezy</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior. This was the orchestra. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">seats--there were twelve rows--were</seg><seg type="columnLine">just plain, ordinary pine benches.

Back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these, and above the front entrance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fact, the only entrance, was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallery. This was reached by means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a sort of Jacob's ladder, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only used by boys.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">manager, etc., informed us that with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a couple of passes for the show he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could get us a table and chairs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">*'mebbe a sofy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine," said Wilson, who was also</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">our stage manager.

This talk about eating had</seg><seg type="columnLine">its effect on us all.

We'll need those</seg><seg type="columnLine">too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few minutes we were all head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for the place where I knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat was tied, and sure enough, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was, but there was also about</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty feet of mud space between us</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the boat, and more beyond that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was low tide, and--well, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a laugh on me that echoed and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">echoed across that dinky river. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't stuck, even if the boat was. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">took off my shoes and socks and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled my pants up over my knees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">untied the rope, and waded out</seg><seg type="columnLine">through that mud to the boat, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed it on out to clear water. "Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">you fellows," I shouted back, "you</seg><seg type="columnLine">take off your shoes and carry the girls</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick-a-back out here and I'll row</seg><seg type="columnLine">them over two at a time." After a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of guying and laughing, we all got</seg><seg type="columnLine">across, but, believe me, it was as near</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard work as you would want to get.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lando would never believe his wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a "heavy woman" until that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. He always thought she ought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be playing leads, but now, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed "heavies" was right. I started</seg><seg type="columnLine">at work on the wigwams right away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the benefit of those who don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite "get me" I will explain how</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are made. Who knows, it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">come in handy for you to understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">the art of making wigwams. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">commence by drawing the tops of</seg><seg type="columnLine">three young saplings toward each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other and tie them fast. There you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the frame of your wigwam all</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready. Then top off a lot of hemlock</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches and lay them, shingle fash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion, with the butts up, against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saplings, until two sides are com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely covered, and there you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a roof that it will take some rain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm to beat through. Then cut the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ends off some more branches and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pile them inside on the ground, about</seg><seg type="columnLine">a foot deep, and there you have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed that for sleeping purposes can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be beaten in the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were just about to start on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second one, after having given Lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">do and his wife a clear title to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">new home, when all of a sudden--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Holy sufferin'! Look there!" We</seg><seg type="columnLine">all looked in the direction indicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Corthell's fat finger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If that aint the Opera House</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning up, I'm a liar," said he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It looks like it," said Wilson, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">our trunks in it. Can you beat that for</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well! what's the use of standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">"OPERA HOUSE TO-NIGHT"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">671</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">here looking at it?" I said. "We've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to do something. Maybe we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">get our trunks out of it, anyway. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be able to save them all right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Come on, Wilson, let's go." And Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son and I waded back through that</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud to the boat, and maybe we didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">do some tall rowing up that river.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We were "going some," believe me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As we got nearer, what little breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had came easier anyhow, for in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of it being the Opera House, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a house that stood near it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, we might as well stick for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big show," says Wilson. "Let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">go and see if we can't do something."</seg><seg type="columnLine">So we landed and went on up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire. By this time the fire-bell, which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the way, wasn't a bell at all, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">an old steel rim off a locomotive</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel, being struck with a sledge-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammer, had brought out every soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the town, all yelling for the fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine, and presently it came. I wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">you could have seen it--an antiquated</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair that bad long handles running</seg><seg type="columnLine">along each side which, manned by</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty or thirty men and boys, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stituted the pumping apparatus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somehow or other the hose refused</seg><seg type="columnLine">to become untangled, so Wilson, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">loudly proclaimed having been a fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man at home in Roxbury, Mass., be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to stage-manage the whole thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He got on top of that old engine, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">without coat or hat, with bare feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and legs, he looked a sight. In fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were a couple of sights. Between</seg><seg type="columnLine">us we managed to get the intake hose</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into the river and Wilson</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelled, "Now pump, you sons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns!" And they did, for all they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were worth. I had command of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nozzle, directing the stream where it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do the most good, and in a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">short time we had the fire out. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">this had its effect on the people, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you could hear: "Say! them show</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellers are all right!"--"Them show</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellers are the beatenest!"--"That fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ler on the engine's been a fireman</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">all right!"--"Say, if 'twasn't fer them</seg><seg type="columnLine">acter fellers, Jim Hopkin's place</seg><seg type="columnLine">would 'a' burned clean up." And so</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, ad lib, the men and women</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded around us, patting us on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, and Wilson says, though I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe it, that several of the girls</seg><seg type="columnLine">kissed him--be that as it may.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, one man, who afterwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved to be the mayor and practical</seg><seg type="columnLine">owner of the town, asked us, "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you play to-morrow night?" We</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn t know that we were going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">play anything, but fatheaded Wilson</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to say "Ingomar." Can you</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine "Ingomar" on that stage?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," says the mayor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where are you staying?" "In those</seg><seg type="columnLine">pine trees over there," I said, point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing across the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, that wont do," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mayor. "Why don't you come up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my house? I've got plenty of room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll send up and get Jenny (meaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">his housekeeper) to get some supper</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready. Will you come?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Would we come? During the prog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ress of the invitation Wilson looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if he had suddenly become an</seg><seg type="columnLine">apoplectic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Would we come? It didn't take</seg><seg type="columnLine">long to convince the mayor that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were more than willing, but "we</seg><seg type="columnLine">must go across the river and get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of the company."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I	told him "how we were sort of up</seg><seg type="columnLine">against it, how our manager had</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipped, etc. etc." Well, the upshot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was that three other boats were</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed into service by our new-</seg><seg type="columnLine">found friend, and in a short time we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all sitting around a real table,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on real chairs, in a regular house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having the feast of our lives. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mayor's larder suffered that night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe me.
