The </p><p>town squatted in the pass between the </p><p>purple peaks, Witch-talk and Rain-maker, </p><p>looking out on the desert that stretched </p><p>leagues to the south in chains of mesquite- </p><p>cluttered, below-sea-level basins, barren, </p><p>sun-rotted hills, and wind-swept mesas. </p><p> Uncle Charlie Hemper brooded in his</p><p>throne-like chair on the wide porch of his </p><p>hotel, the Hemper House. His sockless </p><p>feet were incased in carpet slippers sized to </p><p>house a jackrabbit; his vast linen trousers </p><p>annoyed him not; his white shirt, ever </p><p>collarless, fitted him as easily as a blanket; </p><p>and his pipe drew freely. Yet, on his </p><p>florid face, surmounted by a gray thatch, </p><p>and seamed with tiny trails of humor, was </p><p>an expression that betrayed a gnawing </p><p>inner irritation. He rumbled deep disap- </p><p>proval as a dull thumping sound issued </p><p>from the upper precincts of the hotel. </p><p>Apparently some one was putting down a </p><p>carpet. </p><p> “Pap” Tuttle, the oldest man in Hemper,</p><p>approached the hotel on his daily round. </p><p>Tick-tack of greasewood stick and whisper of </p><p>congress shoes. A thin sigh, and Pap had </p><p>found a chair. </p><p> The landlord used Pap as a word sink.</p><p>One might shovel words into the withered </p><p>ancient for a fortnight and be sure he would </p><p>not resurrect them in the garb of gossip. </p><p> Uncle Charlie gave Pap a gloomy side-</p><p>glance. </p><p> “Won’t be any hotel left,” he grumbled,</p><p>“by the time things are in shape to suit that </p><p>niece of mine. Pap, she wrote me that she </p><p>had to have a bedroom for herself and a </p><p>settin’-room, too. Then a bedroom for the </p><p>boy, Dickie, her brother, with the whole </p><p>side in a winder. Boy has weak lungs. </p><p>And two four-hawse loads of plunder have </p><p>come a'ready—pianer, books, pictures and </p><p>ridin’ outfits. They was left a world of </p><p>Copyright, 191S. by The Ridgway Company in the United States and Great Britain. AH rights reserved. 3 </p><p>4 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>money. My sister Mary, their mother, </p><p>married a rich feller name of Wayne. Both </p><p>dead now, and them two children with </p><p>nothin’ to do but spend the int^st on a </p><p>mountain of money.” </p><p> He paused and glanced down the desert</p><p>road. </p><p> “There comes King Norn on his big</p><p>pinto—but, as I was sayin’, that girl sure </p><p>wants things to suit her. I’m all upset </p><p>with gettin’ ready for ’em. Pap, I’m get- </p><p>tin’ too old for change and pullin’ and haul- </p><p>in’. But I’ll have to bear with them. </p><p>The boy’s sick, and they’re my own flesh </p><p>and blood.” </p><p> Pap took out a plug of tobacco, cut into</p><p>little half-severed squares out of courtesy to </p><p>his toothlessness, broke off a square and </p><p>placed it in his mouth. For several mo- </p><p>ments he stared vacantly at the landlord. </p><p>Then his Adam’s apple began running up </p><p>and down excitedly. In a voice, squeaky </p><p>from disuse, he abruptly questioned-’ </p><p> “Girl good lookin’?”</p><p> “Of course, you old coot,” Uncle Charlie</p><p>fluiig-at'him indignantly. “All my wimmin </p><p>folks were good-lookin’. My sister was the </p><p>finest-lookin’ girl in Missouri.” </p><p> Fap arose at a slant, and wagged his</p><p>head gloomily. He helped himself to a </p><p>fresh quid, and made a futile gesture as </p><p>though warding off some impending disaster, </p><p>and scuffed away. </p><p> “I hope,” muttered the unreasonable</p><p>Uncle Charlie virtuously, “I never get like </p><p>that—always a-lookin’ on the dark side of </p><p>things, and a-gruntin’ if things don’t move </p><p>along in the same old way.” </p><p> Chang, the old Chinese who ruled the</p><p>Hemper House kitchen, grunted hopelessly </p><p>as Maria, one of his assistants, dropped a </p><p>dish. Indians were fat, sleepy fools on </p><p>whom one might not depend even to boil </p><p>water. Maria, ignoring alike Chang’s glare </p><p>and the pottery fragments, moved over to </p><p>the window and peered out shyly.</p><p> King Norn looked up from tying his</p><p>horse, and saw the round, brown face, </p><p>framed in heavy black braids, peering at </p><p>him through the window. </p><p> He laughed at the quaint picture she</p><p>made. He had known Maria since she </p><p>was a roly-poly baby playing in the sun, </p><p>and she held a warm spot in his affections. </p><p>He held up a warning finger. </p><p> “Don’t move. Close your eyes, and</p><p>don’t move. I’ve a present for you.” </p><p> She obeyed his instructions, shutting her</p><p>eyes tightly, and holding out her hands. </p><p>He reached quickly into his saddle pocket, </p><p>and brought to light what appeared to be a </p><p>ball of down. This he placed in one of her </p><p>outstretched hands. She opened her eyes </p><p>quickly, startled by the warmth of the live </p><p>thing she held. </p><p> “A young mocker I found by the road-</p><p>side. Take care of him, Maria, and he will </p><p>sing for you.” </p><p> She gently smoothed the fledgling, the</p><p>while she gave the man little shy glances of </p><p>adoration. He had thought of her, bring- </p><p>ing to her who was named Mocking Bird a </p><p>little mocking bird. She fully appreciated </p><p>the delicate compliment, but, though she </p><p>could speak three languages, she could think </p><p>of no fitting words to express her joy. She </p><p>could only give the man a full adoring </p><p>glance—a glance in which there was the </p><p>poignant pain of a woman’s love. But </p><p>Norn was blind to that glance. She was </p><p>still “the little brown one” to him. As he </p><p>smoothed the fledgling in her hands, he </p><p>failed to notice how her fingers raised to his </p><p>as steel to magnet, and the sharp intake </p><p>of her breath at the seemingly accidental </p><p>contact. </p><p> He patted her head, admonished her to</p><p>take good care of the mocker, pointed his </p><p>finger at her, cocking the thumb as though </p><p>shooting at her, and paused to see her smile. </p><p>He had always been able to make her smile. </p><p>Then he whirled and strode toward the </p><p>front of the hotel, calling out a hearty </p><p>greeting to Uncle Charlie, and vaulting over </p><p>the side rail of the porch. </p><p> “Set down,” invited Uncle Charlie,</p><p>fumbling for his tobacco. “How’s things </p><p>goin’ on out to your place?” He did not </p><p>wait for Norn’s answer, but went on </p><p>hurriedly: “My niece and nephew are </p><p>cornin’ in on today’s stage. House all torn </p><p>up.” He aimed a wicked blow at a fly, </p><p>missed, and sighed resignedly. “Your </p><p>room’s ready, if you figger on stayin’ in </p><p>tonight.”	*</p><p> Norn seated himself on the floor of the</p><p>porch, drawing up his feet Turk fashion, </p><p>and looked up at the old man in the chair, </p><p>a mixture of amusement and affection in </p><p>his eyes. </p><p> “It will be good for you to have your</p><p>own flesh and blood with you,” the young </p><p>man said. </p><p> Uncle Charlie admitted the truth of</p><p>The Survivor </p><p>5 </p><p>Norn's statement with a nod, but his </p><p>expression displayed little enthusiasm. </p><p> “Younguns take a lot of work, and</p><p>always change things. Change always </p><p>bothers a man as old as I be, although, </p><p>Gawd knows, I’m as good as I ever was. </p><p>I don't notice the time, but it’s been quite </p><p>a spell since I unyoked my bulls in this </p><p>pass, and your paw come over from the </p><p>ranch and give me the hand of friendship. </p><p>Your paw was a great man, King. I felt </p><p>like I’d lost a brother when he crossed the </p><p>Big Divide. But everything changes, </p><p>nothin’ stays. Yesterday this pass was </p><p>a mess of greaseweed, catclaw, and cotton- </p><p>woods. Today she holds a town, and the </p><p>stage gets in regular. Tomorrow a railroad </p><p>will come along, and the Hemper House </p><p>won't be good enough for the soft ones that </p><p>ride on cushions. Perhaps I’ll be gone </p><p>then; hope so.” </p><p> Norn settled his head back against a</p><p>pillar, knowing that Uncle Charlie had to </p><p>do a certain amount of mental wandering </p><p>before striking the main trail of thought. </p><p> “What I was goin’ to say,” the old man</p><p>concluded, “was that I’d like you to meet </p><p>my niece and nephew. The boy’s sickly- </p><p>like—lungs, I guess—and I may be askin’ </p><p>you to take Him out to your ranch for a </p><p>spell. As for the girl I’ve give up tryin’ </p><p>to Jigger out what to do for her. There’s </p><p>nothin’ here for a girl.” </p><p> “No,” echoed Norn sympathetically,</p><p>“there is nothing here for a girl.” </p><p> The rancher thought of the life he led,</p><p>free as that of any barbaric prince. Hem- </p><p>per would be a prison to a woman used to </p><p>crowds, and light and laughter. He could </p><p>only endure about so much of it, and then </p><p>New York, London or Paris, to become an </p><p>immaculately-garbed spectator of the thick- </p><p>flowing city life. Then weariness and </p><p>boredom, and finally a swift winging </p><p>back to his beloved mountains and </p><p>desert. </p><p> But Uncle Charlie’s niece would have to</p><p>remain with her sick brother. No pleasure </p><p>trips to break the monotony of life in a</p><p>man’s town on the desert’s edge. Must </p><p>be an unusual woman to make such a sacri- </p><p>fice. Still, he did not propose to entangle </p><p>himself in the destinies of Uncle Charlie’s </p><p>relatives. They might come out to his </p><p>ranch that sprawled in the lap of Rain- </p><p>maker, and hunt and fish, but he wouldn’t </p><p>clutter up his life with their troubles. </p><p>THE main street of Hemper quick- </p><p>ened into life. The stage from the </p><p>west was due in a few minutes. </p><p>Men came strolling toward the hotel, look- </p><p>ing at their watches. The arrival of the </p><p>stage from the west was a momentous </p><p>affair to the citizens of Hemper, though </p><p>they pretended to treat the event with </p><p>lofty indifference. </p><p> “Chance” Hardy, the cold-eyed, flat-</p><p>cheekboned, black-haired proprietor of the </p><p>saloon and gambling-house across the street, </p><p>strode over to the hotel porch, greeted Norn </p><p>casually, and settled himself in a wicker </p><p>chair. He lighted a cigar, flicking out the </p><p>match with a supple white finger. </p><p> Uncle Charlie waddled into the hotel</p><p>office and secured a huge telescope. Steady- </p><p>ing the telescope against a porch pillar, </p><p>he fitted the eyepiece under a shaggy brow. </p><p> Then, triumphantly—</p><p> “There she is—just cornin’ over the last</p><p>raise!” </p><p> With a bear-like shamble he returned</p><p>to the office, carefully replaced the telescope </p><p>on its ancient pegs, and sought the kitchen </p><p>to spur, Chang to action. Breathing heav- </p><p>ily, he returned to the porch. Running a </p><p>hotel was strenuous work. </p><p> Old Pat, the stage-driver, usually at-</p><p>tempted a flourish as he came into Hemper. </p><p>He cracked the long whip, and halted the </p><p>steaming leaders on a line exactly even </p><p>with the porch, giving himself the indiffer- </p><p>ent air of a conquering hero. He was </p><p>king of the reins, and not for gold or </p><p>precious jewels would he do anything but </p><p>drive the four. The removal of baggage and </p><p>mail was the work of menials, and he would </p><p>not demean himself by lifting a pound. </p><p> The stage door opened and a large, fleshy,</p><p>well-dressed man, with a round, dimpled</p><p>chin, stepped down gingerly, fearful of </p><p>getting dust on his shining shoes. He gave </p><p>the loungers on the porch a cursory glance, </p><p>and pushed his way past Uncle Charlie. </p><p> “Driver, what have you done with my</p><p>baggage?” </p><p> Pat looked down at the big, soft face, and</p><p>drawled insultingly: </p><p> “I got something else to do besides</p><p>thinkin’ about your baggage. Leastwise, </p><p>I didn’t eat it.” </p><p> The fat man retired in confusion, and</p><p>the loungers on the porch smiled grimly. </p><p>Old Pat was a hard pill. </p><p> Uncle Charlie was giving various orders</p><p>6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>to Maria’s father who had come from the </p><p>rear of the hotel to care for the baggage. </p><p>The old man was excited, and sought to </p><p>conceal that unusual condition by bellowing </p><p>orders at the patient old Indian. </p><p> Norn still retained his seat on the floor</p><p>of the porch, not deigning to look at the </p><p>stage. He was not posing. The arrival of </p><p>the stage meant nothing to him, for he had </p><p>a vast stock of memories of cities and </p><p>strange places from which to draw comfort. </p><p> Presently, a thin boy in knickerbockers</p><p>descended from the stage. </p><p> “Dickie!” yelled Uncle Charlie, seizing</p><p>the lad and lifting him from the ground. </p><p>“I’m your uncle, boy!” </p><p> Dickie smiled politely. The old man</p><p>gave his nephew a hearty smack, and gently </p><p>pushed him toward the'porch. The boy </p><p>saw Norn seated on the floor, and smiled </p><p>faintly as the man gave him a friendly glance. </p><p> “Poor youngster,thought the rancher,</p><p>“he has arrived just in time.” </p><p> Uncle Charlie thought at first he had a</p><p>touch of sun-stroke. He had always </p><p>boasted' that his sister was the most beau- </p><p>tiful girl in Missouri, but he was not </p><p>prepared for the vision of beauty that </p><p>descended from the stage, assisted by the </p><p>fat stranger who seemed to have pre- </p><p>empted the part of cavalier. Then pride </p><p>of blood surged up in the old man. This </p><p>calm, gracious, beautiful woman was his </p><p>niece. </p><p> “Uncle Charlie!” she murmured; and</p><p>slipped her arms around the old man’s neck </p><p>and kissed him. </p><p> Gone forever were Uncle Charlie’s</p><p>grumblings concerning the trouble that </p><p>relatives make an old man. She stepped </p><p>fairly into his heart. A rich emotion </p><p>welled up within him. </p><p> “Darned old fool I am, Dora. I’m so</p><p>blind I can’t see you.” He held her off </p><p>at arm’s length. But all he could say was, </p><p>“Oh, girl! Oh, girl!”</p><p> The fat stranger attempted to escort</p><p>Miss Wayne to the porch, but Uncle </p><p>Charlie gave him a terrible glare, and put </p><p>a proprietary arm around his niece. </p><p> Chance Hardy arose, and Norn, not</p><p>looking up, but knowing that a woman was </p><p>present, got to his feet. The other men </p><p>stepped back awkwardly. </p><p> “This is Mr. Hardy,” Uncle Charlie</p><p>began, proudly. “Mr. Hardy, my niece, </p><p>Miss Dora Wayne.” </p><p> Hardy raised his dark gaze to the cool</p><p>violet eyes of the girl and flinched inwardly. </p><p>As he noted her loveliness, the utter warm </p><p>womanliness of her, his hands tightened </p><p>until his knuckles whitened. He removed </p><p>his hat and bowed with a grace that sur- </p><p>prised those who knew him. The girl </p><p>lightly acknowledged the pleasure of meet- </p><p>ing Mr. Hardy. </p><p>NORN was the last to be presented. </p><p>He bowed, and then, as their eyes </p><p>met, he imagined that he* felt a </p><p>sudden stab of pain in his chest—a pang of </p><p>the spirit that could hardly be distinguished </p><p>from physical pain. He strove to speak, </p><p>marveling at the fact that he, a man of the </p><p>world, was stricken dumb. But he gath- </p><p>ered his forces and managed to remark— </p><p> “Doubtless you have had a hard trip.”</p><p> Even as he spoke he noted the sickening</p><p>inanity of his words. </p><p> “Oh, no,” she coolly returned. “I</p><p>greatly enjoyed it.” </p><p> She was moving toward the office door.</p><p>Dickie had taken her hand, and Uncle </p><p>Charlie was holding her arm. The fat </p><p>stranger sprang forward to open the door. </p><p> Each man on the porch cursed himself</p><p>for a blockhead. Not one of them had </p><p>said anything worth while, and not one had </p><p>thought to open the screen door. The </p><p>fat stranger clung to the happy trio until </p><p>they reached the stairway. Then he re- </p><p>turned to the porch, and introduced himself </p><p>to the somber-faced Hemperites as G. </p><p>Holden Brown, interested in the resources </p><p>of the country—ahem! No one made any</p><p>comment, and one by one the men of </p><p>Hemper departed, leaving the stranger in </p><p>possession of the porch. Hardy, however, </p><p>gave the fat man a deadly ophidian stare. </p><p> “That fat stranger thinks well of himself,”</p><p>Hardy remarked over his shoulder, as he </p><p>and Norn entered the saloon. </p><p> Hardy, Norn thought, was already at-</p><p>tracted by the girl’s beauty. </p><p> The bartender, knowing the rancher’s</p><p>habits, set him out a glaBs of mineral water. </p><p>Hardy joined him, taking a cigar at his cool </p><p>invitation. </p><p> “Says he’s interested in the resources of</p><p>the country,” sneered Hardy. “G. Holden </p><p>Brown, hey! G. Holden Mush would be </p><p>better.” </p><p> Yes, concluded Norn, Hardy was inter-</p><p>ested in Uncle Charlie’s niece, else why </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>7 </p><p>should he be annoyed at the prancing of </p><p>the fat stranger. The Hardy way with </p><p>women was cold, utterly selfish and brutal </p><p>to the extreme. A smile as cold as star- </p><p>light on snow crept into Norn’s eyes. </p><p>Would that violet-eyed, dark-haired, full- </p><p>blown woman travel the trail of those the </p><p>gambler had discarded? If that was the </p><p>Hardy plan, he would endeavor to block it. </p><p>But why? A man was free to seek any </p><p>woman. Again that pang—that curious </p><p>pang. Intuition told him that Hardy was </p><p>about to comment on the girl’s beauty. </p><p>He must escape before the gambler mouthed </p><p>her name. Didn’t like the idea of talking </p><p>about any woman in a saloon. Yes; that </p><p>was it—any woman. </p><p> He fairly flung himself from the saloon,</p><p>and hurried to his horse. He felt a desire </p><p>to get into the desert silence, and classify </p><p>and brand the unruly thoughts milling in </p><p>his mind. </p><p> As he vaulted into the saddle, he glimpsed</p><p>Billy Snake, a Piute renegade, prowling </p><p>in the cottonwoods near the road. The </p><p>Indian, as the rancher dashed down the </p><p>desert road, stared after him with eyes </p><p>that flamed murderous hatred. </p><p> Now, Billy, being of mature age, greatly</p><p>desired a squaw, and had selected Maria for </p><p>that honor. But her parents, being Mis- </p><p>sion Indians, looked down on the vagabond </p><p>Piute, and refused him the hospitality of </p><p>their cabin back of the hotel kitchen. </p><p> Billy had then threatened Maria’s father</p><p>with various unpleasant deaths, promising </p><p>lastly to cut out the old Indian’s heart and </p><p>eat it raw. A furious gabbling had ensued. </p><p>Uncle Charlie, hearing the clamor, had </p><p>rushed back, and incontinently kicked the </p><p>Piute into the road. </p><p> And, then, to add to the black rage</p><p>bubbling thickly in his heart, Billy had </p><p>seen Norn give Maria the fledgling. </p><p> Maria had prepared a nest for the mocker</p><p>in a cigar box, resolving later to weave a </p><p>little cage of willow withes for the belpved </p><p>birdling. She missed seeing Norn depart, </p><p>Uncle Charlie having sent her up-stairs to</p><p>begin her duties as maid to his niece. </p><p> Dora’s beauty, the richness of her garb,</p><p>made the shy Indian girl feel as though </p><p>she had been appointed handmaiden to </p><p>some divinity. Dora gently instructed her </p><p>in her duties which were light and simple. </p><p> Mrs. Milliken, a motherly soul whom</p><p>Uncle Charlie has secured to take charge </p><p>of Dickie, arrived and proceeded to win the </p><p>heart of the boy. </p><p> When Dora had excused Maria for the</p><p>afternoon, the Indian girl returned to her </p><p>fledgling, and took it out to the step of the </p><p>cabin. There, with many murmured en- </p><p>dearments, she wove for it a little cage of </p><p>willow withes. </p><p> Billy Snake crouched low in the shadows</p><p>of the cottonwoods. Maria could not see </p><p>him from where she sat, but he could plainly </p><p>see her at her labor of love. When the </p><p>time of reckoning came, the gift of the white </p><p>man would be destroyed. Perhaps the </p><p>white man would follow the way of his </p><p>gift- </p><p> Billy had come to town with a message</p><p>from certain desert rovers to Hardy. Tliat </p><p>message had been delivered, and he had </p><p>been slipped his reward, a quart of whisky. </p><p>He would return to the desert and drink </p><p>the whisky. The water of fire that gave </p><p>a man the courage to do and to dare any- </p><p>thing would tell him how to destroy the </p><p>white man and his gift,.-and how .to secure </p><p>the squaw. </p><p> So thinking, he sought his pony tethered</p><p>beyond the cottonwoods, and sped back to </p><p>the desert. </p><p> The little cage grew in the deft hands of</p><p>Maria. Ah, he had remembered her— </p><p>had brought her a gift! A living bird that </p><p>would in time sing to her sweetly. And </p><p>her soul in anticipation of the bird-song, </p><p>sang blithely within her. </p><p> Old Chang in the kitchen door shook his</p><p>head. She, an Indian girl, made too much </p><p>of the white man’s gift. But that was a </p><p>woman’s way: like a child playing in the </p><p>sunlight, all heedless of the coming of night. </p><p>CHAPTER II </p><p>AS NORN struck the edge of the </p><p>desert, down to which the pass </p><p>abruptly sloped, he asked himself </p><p>the strange question: was it possible for him </p><p>to become seriously interested in any </p><p>woman? Did they not all talk the same </p><p>talk? Knowing the love of one was to </p><p>knowr the love of hundreds. But a recur- </p><p>rence of that curious pang wrung from him </p><p>the admission that this woman who was </p><p>named Dora Wayne might be different. </p><p> There was a sphinx-like air about her, a</p><p>slumbering mystery. She rested secure in </p><p>her beauty, looking out on the world of </p><p>8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>contending men, serene and indifferent. </p><p>Here was no ordinary beauty, merely skin- </p><p>deep. Doubtless many men had des- </p><p>perately endeavored to rouse her interest. </p><p>She had traveled the world over; she had </p><p>many memories of men. She knew their </p><p>word-formulse, their strutting egotisms. </p><p> What then, admitting an interest in her,</p><p>would a man have to do to attract her </p><p>attention? Long he pondered that ques- </p><p>tion. Perhaps, a circle of danger drawn </p><p>around her would eliminate many men, but </p><p>she could always give any man safe conduct </p><p>with her smile. A man might encircle her </p><p>with gun-smoke, and she could dispel it with </p><p>a little smile. </p><p> Yes, many men had come to her with the</p><p>old, hackneyed phrases, parading their self- </p><p>imagined virtues and beating the drum of </p><p>egotism. </p><p> What of the stranger—G. Holden</p><p>Brown—whose well-tailored clothes failed </p><p>to conceal the lumps of superfluous flesh? </p><p>Uncle Cliarlie had said nothing of his niece </p><p>having a business^ manager. Possibly the </p><p>fat anafifwas one of those blatant idiots, a </p><p>Gain or a stage acquaintance. He gave </p><p>Brown considerable thought, knowing that </p><p>not infrequently a wise woman is won by </p><p>that glib, persistent type. </p><p> Then she might be engaged to be married.</p><p>But no solitaire had warned “No tres- </p><p>passing.” Not that a ring would make </p><p>any difference. He had always told him- </p><p>self that, when he met the right woman, </p><p>no bar of society would hold him back, </p><p>providing she favored him. </p><p> Granting then that no rival in the outside</p><p>world gripped her thought, there remained </p><p>only the desert men. The fame of her </p><p>beauty would travel across the wastes </p><p>with the mysterious swiftness of thought. </p><p>Hard-bitten, bronze-jawed men would </p><p>travel through heat and dust to gaze upon </p><p>this Aphrodite sojourning for a time amid </p><p>earthly surroundings. Having once viewed </p><p>the goddess they would think no thoughts </p><p>save the long thoughts of her. </p><p> But, he anticipated, only the strong</p><p>would have an opportunity to worship </p><p>at her shrine. Then he considered that </p><p>mysterious weakness of woman, recalling </p><p>several wonder-women who had mated </p><p>with scrawny, insignificant men. And did </p><p>not Dora W'ayne treat her weakling brother </p><p>with great tendei-ness? </p><p> Norn rode straight into the desert basin</p><p>beyond the pass in which Hemper cuddled. </p><p>The basin was guarded on the south by </p><p>Witch-talk Mountain and on the north- </p><p>west by Rain-maker. </p><p> Witch-talk was so named by the Indians</p><p>because of periodical rumblings within its </p><p>bowels. At such times the savages de- </p><p>clared “the witch” was talking, and </p><p>hastened to propitiate her with gifts. To </p><p>the southeast from both peaks ran ranges </p><p>of barren desert hills. </p><p> Witch-talk imposed his mighty bulk</p><p>between the ocean rains and the desert, </p><p>but occasionally some persistent and in- </p><p>trepid cloud would creep around the </p><p>shoulder of the mountain and battle with </p><p>the sun, only to be vanquished and retreat </p><p>in a mist of childish tears. </p><p> At such times a rainbow would smile</p><p>across the pass as though to comfort the </p><p>defeated cloud. </p><p> Over that desert basin Nature often</p><p>projected a moving picture of the moods </p><p>of every zone: a storm raging on the peaks, </p><p>rain and darkness in the pass, a light </p><p>shower over the edge of the basin, and to </p><p>the east a clear sky and a blazing sun. In </p><p>the basin grew the semi-tropic wild palm, </p><p>but, in a few hours’ ride, one could be in </p><p>deep snow amid giant pines. To Norn, </p><p>there was a never-ending charm to the </p><p>desert basin that called him back from his </p><p>world wanderings again and again. </p><p> He headed for a lonely group of palms</p><p>that lifted their proud heads some twenty </p><p>miles from Hemper. There his riders had </p><p>constructed a board shack, and a horse- </p><p>shelter. There was always a little food </p><p>in the shack. It was one of several camps </p><p>scattered about over his cattle range. </p><p>Beneath the palms a sort of salt grass grew. </p><p>thickly, and there was open water. </p><p> Norn loosed his faithful pinto. He had</p><p>not eaten since dawn, and he was ravenously </p><p>hungry. He shot a rabbit with his saddle </p><p>gun, dressed it, and soon had it sizzling in a </p><p>frying pan over a camp-fire in front of the </p><p>shack. He made a sort of “dough-god” </p><p>of corn-meal, and propped it up by the fire. </p><p>He thoroughly enjoyed the meal. Though </p><p>he had sufficient money to have had a </p><p>sumptuous meal served him in that camp, </p><p>he preferred the simple and primitive. </p><p> He threw several chunks of mesquite</p><p>on the glowing embers, and then drew back </p><p>a little into the shadows. </p><p> What a friendly thing is a lire, talking</p><p>The Survivor </p><p>9 </p><p>to one with little intimate whispers inter- </p><p>spersed with crackles of laughter. How </p><p>many lonely, weary adventurers have seen </p><p>from afar the beckoning flame of a friendly </p><p>fire, and tightened belt and quickened pace! </p><p>And how many incautious men in the </p><p>lonely places have forgotten that the little </p><p>fire innocently tells tales to those who </p><p>prey! </p><p> The desert night deepened, and over the</p><p>black, serrated crest of Witch-talk the stars </p><p>seemed to be signaling one another with </p><p>pulsations of radiance. </p><p> Some sense of an alien presence made</p><p>the rancher seize his rifle, and leap to his </p><p>feet and back into the deeper shadows. </p><p>Through the mesquite he caught a faint </p><p>gleam of steel. He eased his rifle forward, </p><p>covered that faint gleam of steel, and </p><p>waited, finger pressing back trigger, thumb </p><p>holding hammer. </p><p>THE lightning-like disappearance </p><p>of the white man disconcerted Billy </p><p>Snake, who had been craftily ma- </p><p>neuvering through the low-hanging mesquite </p><p>to get a clear view of the mocking-bird- </p><p>giver, and to close the account with one </p><p>shot. Perhaps Norn, who, men said, </p><p>was like a panther in the night, was now </p><p>watching him, waiting for the slightest </p><p>hostile move. The Indian was not equal </p><p>to the strain and suspense. He arose, </p><p>making a loud pretense of stamping down </p><p>the mesquite, and stalked into the circle </p><p>of firelight. </p><p> “Drop your rifle,” twanged Norn, from</p><p>the gloom. </p><p> Billy obeyed, knowing that death beck-</p><p>oned. </p><p> Then the rancher came from the shadows,</p><p>seized the Indian’s shoulder and turned </p><p>him around that the firelight might illumi- </p><p>nate his crafty countenance. The white </p><p>man looked deep into the glittering eyes. </p><p> “Haven’t I always given you grub?” he</p><p>demanded. </p><p> Billy Snake nodded sullenly.</p><p> “Then why do you creep up to my fire</p><p>like a coyote in the night?” </p><p> “Me come speak for Bundy,” said the</p><p>Piute. “Me no see Norn by fire. Me </p><p>look long time—maybe nudder man by fire. </p><p>Sabe?” </p><p> “Yes, I sabe,” said Norn, releasing the</p><p>savage, “but that is Indian talk. Your </p><p>heart is bad against me.” </p><p> Billy’s eyes grew dull as a snake’s in skin-</p><p>shedding time. The white man was mock- </p><p>ing him, trying to trap him with words. </p><p> “Bundy him come now,” said the Indian</p><p>finally; and seated himself on the ground </p><p>by the fire. </p><p> A moment later Norn heard the clink</p><p>of spurs, and “Rat” Bundy, followed by </p><p>several members of his gang, entered the </p><p>circle of firelight. </p><p> “Saw your fire,” Bundy opened, with</p><p>great pretense of friendship, “and Billy </p><p>offered to come and see if it was you or one </p><p>of your riders.” </p><p> Norn gave the Indian a chill smile.</p><p> Billy Snake slowly reached for his rifle,</p><p>and, having secured it, backed away, </p><p>mumbling something about watching the </p><p>horses. </p><p> Bundy and his men, all heavily armed,</p><p>dropped down into various positions of </p><p>comfort around the fire. </p><p> Norn remained standing, holding his rifle</p><p>with apparent carelessness but in such a </p><p>position that it easily dominated his self- </p><p>bidden guests. Between him—and the </p><p>Bundy gang of cattle-rustlers and man- </p><p>killers existed an armed truce. It was </p><p>understood that in time of need the gang </p><p>might kill a Norn steer, but they must </p><p>not waste the meat or sell it. This agree- </p><p>ment had come down to Norn from his </p><p>father and the leader of the gang that had </p><p>preceded the Bundy aggregation. The </p><p>agreement had followed a battle between </p><p>the elder Norn and the old gang in which </p><p>the former had been victorious to such an </p><p>extent that the remaining outlaws resolved</p><p>to patch up a truce with him. </p><p> The old gang had never broken the truce,</p><p>and, so far as King Norn knew, the Bundy </p><p>gang had observed it faithfully. The </p><p>Bundy gang saw in King Norn a more </p><p>relentless man than his father, and had no </p><p>desire to risk the loss of members they </p><p>knew would surely follow an open break. </p><p>They might kill King Norn, but the price </p><p>of his life was too high. Better eat his </p><p>beef, and keep on friendly terms. Then </p><p>Bundy was not the indomitable wolf of the </p><p>desert that the old gang leader had been. </p><p>This latter fact, coupled with that of no </p><p>visible degeneration in the Norn stock, held </p><p>the old truce intact. </p><p> “Thought we might drift into town</p><p>tonight,” Bundy said, lazily. “Cool </p><p>ridin’.” </p><p>io </p><p>Adventure </p><p> The rustler was attempting to make</p><p>conversation, but Norn gave him no </p><p>encouragement. The rancher wanted to </p><p>be alone with his thoughts. </p><p> Silence oppressed Bundy. He stirred</p><p>uneasily, and proceeded to let his tongue </p><p>rattle. </p><p> “Billy Snake come from town today.</p><p>He says Hemper’s folks come in.” </p><p> Norn was in no mood to discuss the</p><p>arrival of “Hemper’s folks” with what he </p><p>considered desert scum. Bundy fumbled </p><p>for a twig to light his cigaret. </p><p> “Billy says,” and the outlaw leader</p><p>smirked broadly, “that the girl is ace-high </p><p>for looks.” He laughed coarsely, as he </p><p>raised the blazing twig to his cigaret. “I’ll </p><p>soon have a good look at her. Good- </p><p>lookin’ fillies are scarce in this man’s coun- </p><p>try. I’m goin’ to-” ~ </p><p> “You stand no chance,” cut in Pete,</p><p>Bundy’s first lieutenant. “Let her get one </p><p>look at that horned-toad face of yours, and </p><p>you’re through.” </p><p> “Oh, I^don’t..kjiow,” drawled Bundy,</p><p>good-fiaturedly. “I may not be pretty, </p><p>but I got a winnin’ way.” </p><p> Pete snorted derisively.</p><p> “Winnin’ way,” he repeated several</p><p>times, with infinite sarcasm. “I got money </p><p>that says you couldn’t hold a Mex senorita’s </p><p>hand if she was asleep.” </p><p> The other members of the gang laughed</p><p>hoarsely. They were used to the bantering </p><p>between their -chief and his lieutenant. </p><p>But in the patrician heart of Norn seethed </p><p>a white rage. These animals were dis- </p><p>cussing her. He knew the sliminess of their </p><p>minds. </p><p> The blatant egotism of Bundy regarding</p><p>his ability as a winner of woman’s favor </p><p>was now in full and noisy action. </p><p> He flipped his cigaret stub into the fire,</p><p>and turned to taunt Pete.</p><p> “Tell you what I’ll do, Pete. Bet you a</p><p>hundred gold agin’ your black hawse that </p><p>I’m the first man in this country to kiss </p><p>the new girl.” </p><p> He unbuttoned his shirt, and began</p><p>clawing at his money belt. </p><p> Pete made no reply to the offer, since he</p><p>was gazing fascinatedly at Norn who was </p><p>bending toward Bundy. </p><p> The outlaw leader looked up, and what</p><p>he saw in Norn’s eyes made his hand cease </p><p>its money-belt fumbling, and stray down </p><p>toward his weapon. </p><p> IN NORN’S eyes was the cold</p><p>sheen of bayonets, his nostrils flared, </p><p>and his lips were parted in a terrible </p><p>smile. The members of the gang were </p><p>absolutely motionless. Each man knew </p><p>that the slightest move would precipitate </p><p>deadly action. Norn might be killed, but </p><p>several of them would die before he suc- </p><p>cumbed to the gang’s lead. </p><p> Pete had no illusions concerning his own</p><p>woman-winning powers, and Bundy’s weak- </p><p>ness filled him with contempt for the man </p><p>who held his leadership largely through the </p><p>dominance and power of a man who sat in </p><p>town—Chance Hardy. </p><p> “Rat,” snarled Pete, “you’d better lay</p><p>off that fool talk.” Then, to Norn con- </p><p>ciliatingly, “Rat’s head needs fixin’.” </p><p> Bundy saw that his gang was not in favor</p><p>of precipitating a battle with King Norn, </p><p>and for some reason Norn was displeased </p><p>with the talk concerning the girl. Probably </p><p>Norn’s way; he had heard the rancher did </p><p>not favor talk concerning any woman. </p><p> He raised his pale eyes, shaded by sun-</p><p>bleached brows, to Norn’s deadly gaze. </p><p> “No harm meant, Norn,” he half-apolo-</p><p>gized, with a nervous laugh. “Pete and </p><p>me are always drivin’ back and forth </p><p>like that.” </p><p> Norn backed into the shadows. Some</p><p>of the men arose, and stretched. Pete </p><p>glanced contemptuously at Bundy. He </p><p>was a poor sort for men to tie to; no policy,</p><p>no mind to see down the trail. Some day </p><p>he, Pete, would grow weary of playing </p><p>second to such a bungler, and then the </p><p>voice of Bundy would be heard no more in </p><p>the land. </p><p> There was now no good reason for pro-</p><p>tracting their stay at the Norn camp. </p><p> “Well, adios,” said Bundy, as they moved</p><p>toward the mesquite. </p><p> Norn made no reply. He watched them</p><p>as they made their way through the mes- </p><p>quite, cursing the malicious thorns. He </p><p>heard Bundy’s coarse laughter as he </p><p>launched some ribald jest, and the reproving </p><p>grumble of Pete. </p><p> The voice of Bundy, insolent and raw,</p><p>came drifting back to him. </p><p> “The bet with Pete goes as it lays,” yelled</p><p>back the outlaw chief. </p><p> Then the dull plomp-plomp of hoofs in the</p><p>sand, and at last silence. </p><p> Norn made a vain attempt to analyze</p><p>his feelings. Why had Bundy’s blatting </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>ii </p><p>aroused in him the killing rage? Was it </p><p>solely because of his chivalry, or was it </p><p>because that he was growing weak? He </p><p>knew that the only true method was to </p><p>waste no time in rage or emotion, but to </p><p>plan quickly and then act. Still, now that </p><p>he was calm, he could not blame Bundy </p><p>so much. The man was proceeding accord- </p><p>ing to his light. </p><p> It came to Norn that were the Kohinoor</p><p>lost in the desert and some slow fool found </p><p>it, he would not long hold it. He would </p><p>soon be destroyed, and he who finally held </p><p>the Kohinoor would be a man in whom the </p><p>will to live had the combined strength of </p><p>those who had died striving to hold the </p><p>jewel. One at a time they would perish, </p><p>until finally came the strong man. They </p><p>who strove to hold the Kohinoor might not </p><p>be blamed, though one expressed his desire in </p><p>terms of filth, and another in classic lan- </p><p>guage. </p><p> A jewel of a woman—a Kohinoor of</p><p>beauty—had come to a little town on the </p><p>desert’s edge. But the Kohinoor lacked </p><p>one quality the woman possessed. She </p><p>could say who should be the guardian of </p><p>her beauty. Her word was final. After </p><p>men had struggled, suffered, dared and </p><p>died, she might say— </p><p> “Away with them all.”</p><p> But Bundy and his ilk did not recognize</p><p>her power of choice. In their thick egotism </p><p>they imagined that they had only to pursue. </p><p>Seeking the elusive woman they would </p><p>meet death face to face. They did not </p><p>know that the high-caste woman must be </p><p>attracted, not pursued. </p><p> The rancher flung himself down, and</p><p>attempted to sleep. A rattler buzzed </p><p>faintly, and he arose, hunted out the snake </p><p>and killed it with his quirt. </p><p> “His warning brought his death,” mut-</p><p>tered the man. “The fool among snakes.” </p><p>What folly it was to think. He walked </p><p>beyond the palms and looked out at the </p><p>gray waste and up at the paling stars. All </p><p>his furious mental scurrying to and fro was </p><p>caused by a woman who was now calmly</p><p>sleeping. He laughed harshly. </p><p> Then he walked back to his horse, and</p><p>petted it, talking to it childishly. He even </p><p>secured some wisps of grass and rubbed </p><p>down the animal. </p><p> Dawn came with glowing bronze bars</p><p>across the eastern sky, and Rain-maker </p><p>shimmering in opalescent haze. A light </p><p>breeze stirred the dry beards of the palms to </p><p>faint cracklings and elusive whisperings. </p><p>Then the thin, querulous morning song of </p><p>the coyotes. </p><p> Soon the keen smell of frying bacon and</p><p>aroma of boiling coffee arose to mingle with </p><p>the tang of greasewood and aromatic </p><p>shrub. </p><p> Norn smiled. Though a man’s soul</p><p>roamed the stars, his clamoring stomach </p><p>must be appeased. </p><p> Through a notch in the mottled hills the</p><p>red sun winked wickedly, promising the </p><p>desert a scorching day. Norn mounted, </p><p>and trotted back to the stage road that </p><p>twisted like a wounded snake across the </p><p>basin. Coming to the branch road leading </p><p>to his ranch, he reined in, hooked a leg </p><p>around the saddle horn, and debated. </p><p>Then the final decision closed his lips in </p><p>a thin line, and he turned and galloped </p><p>toward Hemper. </p><p>CHAPTER III </p><p>BUNDY was Hardy’s 'choke,, and </p><p>therein lay the true source of the </p><p>Bundy chieftainship. The gang- </p><p>ling cattle-rustler was very pliable in the </p><p>hands of the gambler. Hardy knew that a </p><p>more positive character would not long </p><p>bring him tribute while he sat in soft ease </p><p>in the town. </p><p> Hardy handled the money derived from</p><p>sales of stolen cattle and horses, allowing </p><p>himself a liberal commission. Ultimately </p><p>the bulk of the money he turned over to the </p><p>gang found its way back to his safe via bar </p><p>and gambling-table. </p><p> Of course, like any feudal chief, Hardy</p><p>protected his men, loaning them money and </p><p>paying their doctor bills. Men not oper-</p><p>ating with the gang but necessary to the </p><p>Hardy welfare came in for a share of his </p><p>largesse. Among his partisans he num- </p><p>bered complaisant officers of the law who, </p><p>instead of hunting down the gang, spent </p><p>most of their time in Hardy’s saloon, ma- </p><p>king no move without consulting him. </p><p>Hardy’s saloon was the courtroom of the </p><p>desert country, and, to a large extent, the </p><p>gambler was judge and jury. </p><p> But between Uncle Charlie and the</p><p>gambler existed an agreement as to division </p><p>of territory. Uncle Charlie was to control </p><p>the hotel and not to be disturbed or an- </p><p>noyed by the Hardy partisans. Hardy was </p><p>12 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>to keep his men under control, and not per- </p><p>mit them to annoy the peaceable citizens of </p><p>the community or to disturb Hemper </p><p>House guests. Uncle Charlie, though a wise </p><p>man in all other respects, had a pet delusion </p><p>regarding his position in Hemper. He re- </p><p>garded himself as a sort of perennial mayor </p><p>of the place. </p><p> In this delusion Hardy indulged the old</p><p>man, consulting him on affairs of no im- </p><p>portance. The desert men, the gambler </p><p>knew, regarded Uncle Charlie with the ven- </p><p>eration they might accord an old landmark. </p><p>This, combined with the fact that the old </p><p>man was no mean warrior, held the Hardy </p><p>policy close to the line of indulgence. </p><p> At times various members of the gang</p><p>made some pretense of working in the mines </p><p>or riding on the cattle round-ups, but gen- </p><p>erally they were swinging back and forth </p><p>from the pass to the Mexican border, </p><p>heavily armed, superbly mounted, and in </p><p>search of booty. There were other gangs </p><p>operating across the Mexican border, and </p><p>the cattle-rustling industry was fairly well </p><p>orgaiazecT^At times the gang would make </p><p>a'little side-venture and relieve some un- </p><p>wary travelers of their valuables, but they </p><p>carefully avoided stage hold-ups, and wisely </p><p>refrained from invading the thickly-settled </p><p>country west of the pass. They had no </p><p>desire to bring a flock of San Francisco and </p><p>Los Angeles deputies down on them. </p><p> Bundy and his men racked into Hemper</p><p>in the early morning, leaving their horses in </p><p>the stage stable corral, and headed straight </p><p>for the saloon where they expected to meet </p><p>Hardy and receive some hard-earned gold. </p><p>Hardy, however, was asleep in his room </p><p>over the saloon, and the gang dulled the </p><p>sharp edge of impatience with several </p><p>rounds of drinks. Billy Snake, who had </p><p>brought them the news of the gold being at </p><p>their disposal, was handed a big drink </p><p>through the back window. </p><p> Breakfast was next in order, and they re-</p><p>moved their belts and secreted their guns </p><p>inside their shirts. Uncle Charlie’s rules </p><p>forbade armed men entering his hotel, and </p><p>they thus evaded any clash with the landlord. </p><p> That one big drink had elevated the</p><p>spirits of Billy Snake until he believed him- </p><p>self to be the equal of any white man. </p><p>Vaguely he recalled a certain disagreeable- </p><p>ness on the part of the old man who ran </p><p>the hotel, but that was a small matter. </p><p>He was hungry, and would eat with the </p><p>man he served. He joined the gang as they </p><p>clattered into the hotel office. </p><p> Uncle Charlie reached back of the table</p><p>that served for a desk and secured his old </p><p>Buffalo gun, an octagon-barreled Sharpe’s. </p><p>The great rifle called for a cartridge that </p><p>might pass as the offspring of a field-piece </p><p>shell, a sort of brass bridegroom of death </p><p>with a paper collar around the bullet. He </p><p>who was hit with a bullet from that gun </p><p>need not worry about doctor bills. Uncle </p><p>Charlie claimed that he had killed seven </p><p>Apaches with one shot from the old bel- </p><p>lower. • The Indians were in single file, and </p><p>one bullet sufficed for the unlucky seven, </p><p>according to the bland statement of the </p><p>landlord. </p><p> ‘'What’s that Injun doin’ in here?” roared</p><p>the irate old man. “I kicked him out’n my </p><p>backyard once! Do I have to shoot him </p><p>out of this place now?” </p><p> Bundy turned and regarded Billy with</p><p>well-feigned polite surprise. </p><p> “Well,” he drawled finally, “an Injun’s</p><p>got to eat same as white folks.” </p><p> “Then send him around to the kitchen</p><p>door, and see that he behaves himself. Any </p><p>shenannigins, and I’ll unhook on him.” </p><p> “Go around to the kitchen,” Bundy or-</p><p>dered his runner. “And don’t get funny </p><p>back there with the help.” </p><p> Billy Snake retired sullenly, his eye on the</p><p>muzzle of the great rifle. </p><p> “Move quick,” Uncle Charlie warned</p><p>him. “This trigger pulls easy.” </p><p> The Indian hastily retreated.</p><p> Uncle Charlie tenderly replaced his rifle</p><p>in its sacred corner. </p><p> “Ought to have got that Injun,” he told</p><p>himself mournfully. “He’s a bad one. I </p><p>ought to have got him.” </p><p> The gang clumped into the dining-room,</p><p>and were soon immersed in trencher-toil, </p><p>consuming vast quantities of bacon and </p><p>pancakes. Bundy looked about him </p><p>eagerly, expecting to see Uncle Charlie’s </p><p>relatives enter and seat themselves at </p><p>the family table. Pete grinned as he read </p><p>Bundy’s thoughts. Bundy would never </p><p>make good his boast of being the first man </p><p>to kiss the new girl. </p><p>BILLY SNAKE brooded for a time </p><p>in the cottonwoods, and then </p><p>slowly approached the hotel kitchen </p><p>door. Maria was in the kitchen preparing </p><p>breakfast for Dora and Dickie which she </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>13 </p><p>would later serve in one of the living-rooms </p><p>up-stairs. Chang was the first to see the </p><p>Indian in the doorway, and his fingers </p><p>tightened on the bread-knife he held. </p><p> “Charlie say me get grub all right,” said</p><p>the Indian to Chang, but with his burning </p><p>eyes on Maria. </p><p> Chang pointed at the clock, and made a</p><p>gesture with the knife that told the Indian </p><p>that the Chinese would serve him in his own </p><p>sweet time. </p><p> The whisky fumes flared up in the In-</p><p>dian's brain, and he stepped into the </p><p>kitchen. Maria sidled back against the </p><p>kitchen table as she realized the Paiute was </p><p>coming toward her. His hand reached out </p><p>to clutch her. She seized a pan of dish- </p><p>water and flung it full in his face. Chang </p><p>then sprang into action. He dropped the </p><p>knife, seized a ladle of hot grease and </p><p>sprayed it over the bewildered Indian. </p><p>Billy beat a swift retreat, howling like a dog. </p><p>Chang secured more ammunition, and stood </p><p>ready to repel any attack, the while he </p><p>emitted weird, shrill Chinese expletives. </p><p> The gang in the dining-room heard the</p><p>commotion, and tipped over their chairs </p><p>and crowded into the kitchen. They </p><p>surged out the back door in time to see Billy </p><p>Snake do a mad dance, and tear his thin </p><p>shirt from his body. They laughed bru- </p><p>tally, and Bundy indulged in such wild </p><p>mirth as to acquire a severe case of hic- </p><p>cups. Billy tore the last vestage of his </p><p>shirt from his body and then dashed toward </p><p>an irrigation ditch into which he plunged </p><p>and rolled. Uncle Charlie had seized his </p><p>rifle and had broken all his speed records </p><p>in a dash to the back door of the kitchen. </p><p> “I’ll have to kill that gosh-blanked Injun</p><p>yet!” he bawled to the tittering hiccupping </p><p>Bundy. “This is the second time he’s tried </p><p>to get gay with Maria. I’ll sure bust him </p><p>next time. Chang give him a dose he won’t </p><p>forget, though.” </p><p> The gang returned to their trencher-toil,</p><p>laughing and commenting on Billy’s intric- </p><p>ate dance steps. </p><p> “I swear,” gurgled Bundy, “that Injun</p><p>stepped like a turkey on a hot iron. I </p><p>wouldn’t a missed it for a pair of new boots. </p><p>First Maria with dishwater and then the </p><p>Chink with hot grease. Billy sure has </p><p>troubles with his courtin’.” </p><p> The gang leader interspersed his food-</p><p>shoveling with inane titters and explosive </p><p>hiccups. </p><p> Uncle Charlie returned to the office</p><p>rumbling disapproval of the whole affair. </p><p>His face was a thundercloud, as the gang </p><p>came from the dining-room and paid him </p><p>for their breakfasts. </p><p> The men drifted out on the porch, and</p><p>paused to roll cigarets. Slowly they strag- </p><p>gled across the street to the saloon, and </p><p>began gambling. They would dip deeper </p><p>into the fleshpots of Hemper when Hardy </p><p>came with the big money derived from the </p><p>last sale of stolen cattle. </p><p> Bundy, however, preferred whisky to</p><p>gambling; and, when Hardy strolled into the </p><p>saloon, the cattle-thief was pleasantly in- </p><p>toxicated, taking a large friendly view of </p><p>himself, considering all things possible. </p><p>What he, Bundy, desired to do, he would </p><p>do; nothing could stop him. He had made </p><p>a certain bet. Very well, in good time he </p><p>would win that bet. But, barring Pete, the </p><p>members of the gang had forgotten the bet, </p><p>for Bundy was prone to make boastful </p><p>declarations which • he sometimes made </p><p>good, but more often later waved aside as a </p><p>mere joke. Among themselves ilfe-tagn re- </p><p>ferred to him as “Windy.” </p><p> Hardy called the gang into a card-room,</p><p>and gave them their share of the cattle- </p><p>money in good, red gold. They immedi- </p><p>ately returned to the games. </p><p> Bundy was oiling his physical and mental</p><p>machinery for an unusual effort. Several </p><p>times he sought the front door to inspect the </p><p>hotel porch. No girl in sight yet. A </p><p>drink, and a dollar or twro on roulette. </p><p>Then he secured his cartridge-belt from the </p><p>bartender, and performed a little dance. </p><p>No one paid any attention to him. He was </p><p>enjoying himself, which was his sacred </p><p>privilege. </p><p> But Bundy had failed to note the arrival</p><p>of King Norn who had ordered a helper at </p><p>the stage barn to place his pinto in a stall. </p><p>It was too early for the regular dinner, but </p><p>Chang, at Uncle Charlie’s request, and a </p><p>liberal donation from Norn, prepared for the </p><p>rancher what is technically known as a </p><p>“short order.” </p><p> While Norn was eating, Dora and her</p><p>brother sauntered down-stairs and out on </p><p>the porch, intending to take a little stroll. </p><p> Bundy, meanwhile, had made his way</p><p>down to the stage barn corral, and saddled </p><p>his horse. He rode into the main street of </p><p>Hemper, noted the girl on the porch, and </p><p>proceeded to show off. He was drunk, but </p><p>14 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>in full control of his physical machinery. </p><p>The whisky had merely expanded his ego- </p><p>tism, causing him to believe that he was all- </p><p>powerful, and the cleverest creature ever re- </p><p>leased by kindly nature. </p><p> Dickie was greatly entertained by</p><p>Bundy’s cowboy stunts, and frequently </p><p>called his sister’s attention to the feats of </p><p>the rider. Bundy would fling down his </p><p>handkerchief, whirl his horse, and race </p><p>back, leaning from the saddle to snatch up </p><p>the handkerchief. Then he would waggle </p><p>his head, and look at the impassive girl on </p><p>the porch as though to say— </p><p> “Look at me; didn’t I do that clever?”</p><p> But the girl was not interested in the</p><p>riding and the cowboy stunts of the flam- </p><p>boyant creature with the wide mouth. </p><p>She had wearied of Buffalo Bill’s Wild West </p><p>Show, with its picked riders, and she had </p><p>yawned when a Cossack officer in Moscow </p><p>had put his whole troop through its paces in </p><p>honor of her. Drunken Bundy, cheap and </p><p>sordid, with his little tricks, was of no more </p><p>interest to her than an organ-grinder’s </p><p>muuJrtfpT </p><p> She arose and murmured to her brother</p><p>that they would take a little walk. Dickie </p><p>linked his arm in hers, and they walked </p><p>down the steps and turned toward the line </p><p>of cottonwoods beyond the irrigation ditch. </p><p>Norn came out on the porch as the girl and </p><p>her brother approached the ditch. </p><p> A few of the gang, including Pete, had</p><p>been attracted from the games by Bundy’s </p><p>street performance. They stood watching </p><p>him. Hardy spoke sharply to Pete. </p><p> “Better tell Bundy to quit that,” he</p><p>snapped; and returned to his little sanctum </p><p>at the end of the bar near the entrance. </p><p> As the girl and her brother strolled toward</p><p>the irrigation ditch, Bundy whirled his </p><p>horse. So intent was he on handling his </p><p>horse properly, and turning the trick neatly, </p><p>that he failed to see Norn near the side rail </p><p>of the hotel porch. </p><p> Suddenly the girl was aware of the bulk of</p><p>a sweating horse, and then a long arm </p><p>whipped around her waist. Whisky fumes, </p><p>and a beastly face lowered to hers. Then a </p><p>form descended on the horse’s croup and the </p><p>beastly face was jerked back. She caught </p><p>the flash of a gun, as Norn snatched </p><p>Bundy’s six-shooter from the holster and </p><p>tossed it aside. The girl staggered back, </p><p>but Dickie, realizing that the rider had at- </p><p>tempted to seize his sister, broke into shrill </p><p>boyish imprecations, and strove to break </p><p>from his sister’s detaining grasp. </p><p> Norn’s left arm was now a rope of steel</p><p>around Bundy’s neck. The rustler in- </p><p>voluntarily spurred his horse, and the ani- </p><p>mal plunged across the ditch, and on </p><p>through the cottonwoods, pitching and </p><p>bucking with his double burden. Bundy </p><p>lost the reins, .and both men were hurled </p><p>to the ground. Norn was up first, and </p><p>jammed his knee in the small of Bundy’s </p><p>back, while he wrenched the rustler’s right </p><p>arm back and up. Bundy answered with a </p><p>groan from the depths of his being. </p><p> Convinced that the six- shooter had been</p><p>Bundy’s sole weapon, Norn leaped back </p><p>from him. Bundy gained his feet, and </p><p>stared stupidly at his assailant. </p><p> Norn slapped him with his open hand.</p><p> “Fight,” snapped the rancher.</p><p>BUNDY gave a wild squeal of rage, </p><p>and charged down with fists swing- </p><p>ing like flails. Norn could have </p><p>knocked him cold, but he wanted to save </p><p>him for punishment. So he proceeded to </p><p>send in hard, heart-shaking blows to certain </p><p>vulnerable parts of the Bundy body. </p><p>Bundy followed the evasive rancher about, </p><p>whining like a dog, and cursing; but Norn </p><p>whipped in a terrible blow to a spot just </p><p>under the heart, and Bundy paused to meet </p><p>the agony that followed. But he had no </p><p>more than met that agony when the Norn </p><p>fist struck him dully in a point over the </p><p>short ribs, and more agony followed. This </p><p>was repeated many times. Then Norn </p><p>began on the man’s solar plexus, sending in </p><p>blow after blow until it became a quivering </p><p>center of agony. </p><p> Billy Snake, glowering over his grease</p><p>burns, watched the fight with awe. The</p><p>man who was his master could not touch </p><p>the mocking-bird-giver. Billy did not like </p><p>fist-fights; they struck him as nasty work. </p><p>A knife would be much quicker and cleaner. </p><p> Bundy was now whistling like a wind-</p><p>broken horse, and Norn shifted his attack </p><p>to the man’s face and head. He proceeded </p><p>to batter the Bundy features to a pulp, </p><p>carefully refraining from striking the base </p><p>of the jaw. Then suddenly from the bloody </p><p>lips of the rustler, broke the thin whine that </p><p>seeps from the innermost core and calls for </p><p>the mercy stroke. </p><p> Norn shifted lightly to the left and swung</p><p>on the base of the Bundy jaw, with his full </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>15 </p><p>weight back of the blow. Bundy sank </p><p>slowly to his knees, and then sprawled over </p><p>on his back. </p><p> Norn returned to the hotel to find Uncle</p><p>Charlie resting his Sharpe’s against a porch </p><p>pillar, his old eye blazing across the sights </p><p>at a group of men in front of the saloon. </p><p> “They were goin’ to interfere,” the old</p><p>man gritted, “but I sort of made ’em change </p><p>their minds. Did you whup him good?” </p><p> Norn made no reply, but glanced at the</p><p>girl who regarded him coldly. He went into </p><p>the hotel washroom. Apparently she had </p><p>no garlands to place on his manly brow for </p><p>having trounced the very life out of the man </p><p>who had attempted to kiss her. Well, he </p><p>couldn’t blame her much. It was tiresome, </p><p>disagreeable business, and she was doubtless </p><p>disgusted with the whole male population </p><p>of Hemper. But he could not have done </p><p>any different. Whether she liked it or not, </p><p>Bundy would no more seek to attract her </p><p>attention. He washed his face and hands, </p><p>and removed the soil of battle from his </p><p>clothing. </p><p> “I guess Mr. Norn nearly laid that man</p><p>out,” remarked Dickie. “If I’d been big </p><p>enough, I would have laid him out, you bet.” </p><p> His sister smiled indulgently, and then</p><p>sighed wearily. After all that man Norn, </p><p>though greatly touted by her uncle, was </p><p>like all the rest of them, ever seeking to </p><p>show off his brute strength, ever parading </p><p>his masculinity. Still, it was a manly </p><p>tiling to relieve her of the annoyance of </p><p>the creature on the horse. She was forced </p><p>to admit that Norn had made no parade </p><p>following the fight. He had merely glanced </p><p>at her. </p><p> She recalled the strutting Italian officer</p><p>who had fought a duel with a fellow-officer </p><p>because he imagined that by such means </p><p>he could gain her favor. The Italian had </p><p>come to her after the duel, boasting of his </p><p>swordsmanship, and had been surprised and </p><p>crushed beyond measure when she dis- </p><p>missed him abruptly. Then there was the </p><p>New York clubman who had trounced an </p><p>imagined rival in front of her apartments.</p><p>After the fight the clubman had come to </p><p>her, expecting to be garlanded with her </p><p>favor. Instead, she had told him that the </p><p>greatest favor he could show her would be </p><p>to remove his being from her presence for- </p><p>ever. Therefore she gave Norn a small </p><p>credit-mark for not running true to the </p><p>usual masculine form. </p><p> Uncle Charlie was replacing his rifle in</p><p>the corner, when Norn came from the </p><p>washroom. </p><p> “Sleep,” said Norn laconically; and</p><p>sought the room Uncle Charlie always re- </p><p>served for him. </p><p> “And she never even thanked him,” the</p><p>landlord marveled aloud. “What kind o’ </p><p>wimmin are they raisin’ these days?” </p><p> The menace of Uncle Charlie’s rifle re-</p><p>moved, Pete ran out to inspect his chief. </p><p>He found Bundy on all fours, making feeble </p><p>attempts to gain his feet. </p><p> Pete returned and reported Bundy’s</p><p>condition to Hardy who was fairly boiling </p><p>over with rage. </p><p> “Bundy’s through,” rasped out the</p><p>gambler. “Get him out of town, and look </p><p>after things yourself. Don’t let me see </p><p>him or there’ll be a funeral. How often </p><p>have I told the—” and here Hardy affixed </p><p>certain descriptions of Bundy’s ancestors </p><p>and general weaknesses— “to keep off the </p><p>street and leave strangers alone.” </p><p> But Hardy’s rage was not caused by any</p><p>high-flown desire to keep intact-th^^eace </p><p>of Hemper, but by the low-browed Bundy </p><p>even daring to think of looking at the woman </p><p>that he, Hardy, had selected for himself. </p><p> Pete hurriedly jerked the gang away</p><p>from the games and the bar and drove them </p><p>to the corral. There, with much grumbling </p><p>and cursing, they saddled their horses. </p><p>They rode over to Bundy who was now </p><p>wandering about like a sick burro. </p><p> Pete reined in and surveyed the whipped</p><p>man disgustedly. </p><p> “Norn certainly done a good job on</p><p>you,” he jeered. “You look like you’d </p><p>been run through a stamp mill. Here,</p><p>Jerry, you and Tom throw this mess on </p><p>his hawse.” </p><p> “He didn’t fight me fair,” Bundy sud-</p><p>denly began wailing, when the two men </p><p>had heaved him into the saddle. “He hit </p><p>me with a club.” </p><p> Pete turned to Billy Snake who was still</p><p>clawing at his burns. </p><p> “How about it, Billy?”</p><p> “No club,” declared Billy, quite em-</p><p>phatically for him. “Hand dis way,” and </p><p>he pantomimed the action of striking with </p><p>the fist, and grunted. “Bundy him cry </p><p>like woman. Norn go way.” </p><p> Pete laughed raucously, and gave Bundy</p><p>a contemptuous cuff with his open hand, </p><p>the while he flouted him. </p><p>i6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “So you squealed, did you! I always</p><p>thought you'd squeal. Well, you’re through, </p><p>and see that you keep your head shut.” </p><p>Bundy did not resent Pete’s open-handed </p><p>smack, but lurched over the saddle horn, </p><p>broken and cowed. </p><p> The gang lashed their former chief with</p><p>contemptuous glances; and, on reaching </p><p>the main camp at the foot of Witch-talk, </p><p>proffered no aid to the beaten man. Let </p><p>the squealer bind up his own wounds. </p><p> “Hand over that hundred,” Pete de-</p><p>manded, as Bundy almost fell from his </p><p>horse. “Hand it over, or I’ll start in where </p><p>Norn left off.” </p><p> Bundy fumbled at his belt but was un-</p><p>able to get out the money. Pete roughly </p><p>relieved him of the money-belt and milked </p><p>it of five twenties, and threw it down at </p><p>the vanquished one’s feet. </p><p>CHAPTER IV </p><p>HARDY waited until Uncle Charlie </p><p>had replaced the buffalo gun in its </p><p>rorTier anti resumed his throne on </p><p>-the" porch. Slowly the gambler crossed </p><p>the street, giving the landlord time to get </p><p>his pipe going. The Hardy mission was </p><p>one of peace. He knew that the girl’s uncle </p><p>held him responsible for the Bundy affair. </p><p> Hardy wagged his head apologetically,</p><p>as he reached the porch steps. </p><p> “Charlie, I’m sorry about Bundy both-</p><p>erin’ Miss Wayne. I had no idea the </p><p>drunken fool would go so far.’’ </p><p> Uncle Charlie began smoking in short,</p><p>quick puffs, and Hardy, noting that sign </p><p>of rising temper, hastily added— </p><p>“Nothin’ like that will happen again.” </p><p>The landlord arose, and menaced the </p><p>gambler with his pipe, bellowing his answer </p><p>in a voice that could be heard the length </p><p>of the street. </p><p> “You’re right it won’t happen again.</p><p>If it does, somebody gets a piU from my </p><p>old Betsy he won’t cough up. Chance</p><p>Hardy, I’ve got along with you for years, </p><p>but, when it comes to my folks, I won’t </p><p>stand no foolishness from you or no livin’ </p><p>man. ’Twas your whisky that made Bundy </p><p>lay his filthy paws on my girl, and, if King </p><p>Norn hadn’t half-killed him, I’d a done the </p><p>job myself. Don’t curry me the wrong </p><p>way, Chance. I’m old, but my finger’s </p><p>still steady on the trigger, and don’t you </p><p>forget it.” </p><p> Hardy affected a contrite air, since he</p><p>believed a state of war between Uncle </p><p>Charlie and him meant the girl’s disfavor. </p><p>It wrenched him to mollify the landlord, </p><p>for, to condemn Bundy was to praise Norn. </p><p>And he was already secretly raging at </p><p>Norn for having seized the leading part in </p><p>the little play. </p><p> “I don’t want any bad feelin’s between</p><p>us, Charlie. I sent the whole bunch out </p><p>of town. After this my bartenders will </p><p>cut ’em short.” </p><p> The old man dropped back in his chair,</p><p>and puffed moodily. After all no great </p><p>harm had been done. Norn had given </p><p>Bundy a lesson he would not soon forget, </p><p>and Hardy had apologized. Still, the </p><p>landlord cocked a suspicious eye at the </p><p>gambler, sensing insincerity. But he finally </p><p>waved his hand, as though putting aside </p><p>something worthless, and rumbled— </p><p> “All right; let it pass.”</p><p> The gambler forced a smile of relief, and</p><p>returned abruptly to his saloon. </p><p> Dora, as was her custom with disagree-</p><p>able memories, had erased that of the </p><p>creature men called Bundy from her mind; </p><p>but thoughts of Norn lingered, irritating </p><p>her slightly. Surely she could not be ex- </p><p>pected to seek him, and, like some rural </p><p>heroine in a comedy drama, thank him for </p><p>having come to her rescue. She finally </p><p>flatly refused to consider any phase of the </p><p>affair; and ordering Maria to pull down </p><p>the curtains, composed herself for a siesta. </p><p> In the evening, after supper, assisted by</p><p>Maria, she arrayed herself in a white dress, </p><p>and threw a gold bespangled scarf over her </p><p>shoulders. Not that she had any inten- </p><p>tion of queening it on the porch, but it was </p><p>pleasant out there, and Dickie liked to</p><p>hear the men talk. Also, Dickie needed </p><p>the fresh air. </p><p> The light from the big lamp in the office</p><p>streamed out through the double window </p><p>and softly illuminated the porch. There </p><p>were big easy cane chairs, and inviting </p><p>rockers. Uncle Charlie’s chair reinforced </p><p>with rawhide to hold his weight, was near </p><p>the side of the porch that the old man </p><p>might rest his slippered feet on the railing. </p><p> The gleam of the girl’s white dress and</p><p>the glitter of her spangled scarf were as </p><p>mystic magnets to the men of Hemper, </p><p>attracting them slowly but surely to the </p><p>porch. They came with various flimsy </p><p>little excuses that made Uncle Charlie, </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>17 </p><p>puffing contentedly in the shadow, smile </p><p>knowingly. </p><p> But to the girl the men worshiping at</p><p>the shrine of her beauty were merely a part </p><p>of the atmosphere. She rarely spoke, </p><p>seemingly occupied with some mysterious </p><p>feminine introspection that made them </p><p>more desirous of attracting her attention. </p><p> G. Holden Brown was ever in close at-</p><p>tendance. The girl was aware of his </p><p>presence as she might be aware of some </p><p>handy automaton that opened doors for </p><p>her and now and then brought her a glass </p><p>of water. </p><p> Abner Twill, Hemper’s lawyer, with</p><p>whom Brown had held several mysterious </p><p>conferences, now felt it necessary to eat </p><p>supper regularly at the Hemper House. </p><p>Prior to the arrival of the girl, Abner had </p><p>limited himself to a Sunday dinner at the </p><p>hotel, his finances being at such a low ebb </p><p>as to hold him close to bacon and beans </p><p>cooked in the little room back of his musty </p><p>office. But now he was splurging mag- </p><p>nificently, a covetous eye on the girl’s </p><p>money. A rich wife would lift him into </p><p>certain political strata in Los Angeles </p><p>where he might run for Congress. </p><p> The lawyer, as he eased his bony frame</p><p>into a rocker, gave G. Holden Brown a </p><p>little calculating glance. Brown was evi- </p><p>dently deeply interested in Miss Wayne. </p><p>For various reasons he must not annoy </p><p>Brown. Still, he would hold his place in </p><p>the circle. As .a guest of the Hemper </p><p>House he had a right to indulge in a little </p><p>light comment. </p><p> Twill had a habit of punctuating his</p><p>remarks with knuckle-cracking. He would </p><p>pull his long, bony fingers until they popped </p><p>like firecrackers. And, when he delivered </p><p>a speech, his joint-popping took on the dig- </p><p>nity of rifle fire. </p><p> “A wonderful beautiful evening, Miss</p><p>Wayne!” he breathed. </p><p> Pop!</p><p> “How balmy the air!”</p><p> Pop! pop!</p><p> “Is not nature, Miss Wayne, glorious in</p><p>her calmer moods?” </p><p> Pop, pop, pop!</p><p> That last series of pops was too much</p><p>for Uncle Charlie. </p><p> “Suff’rin Moses, Ab,” bawled the old</p><p>man desperately, “leave your j’ints alonel </p><p>Sounds like you was pullin’ yourself apart. </p><p>Makes me nervous. Stop it!” </p><p>2 </p><p> That silenced Abner Twill. Unless he</p><p>popped his finger joints, he could not talk; </p><p>unless he talked, he merely occupied so </p><p>much space. </p><p> Dickie stared fascinatedlv at the funereal</p><p>Twill. </p><p> “Let him crack his fingers, Uncle Char-</p><p>lie,” begged the boy. “It’s fun.” </p><p> The lounging men laughed, and poor</p><p>Twill placed his hands back of the chair </p><p>out of the way of temptation. </p><p> G. Holden Brown launched an alto-</p><p>voiced panegyric on nature’s moods, wind- </p><p>ing up with some fragments of a lecture </p><p>he had been forced to attend to please </p><p>some San Francisco friends. </p><p> Feelingly he sighed—</p><p> “How often have I pondered upon the</p><p>metamor-” </p><p>HE CHECKED himself. Cun- </p><p>ningham, the Hemper doctor, had </p><p>just arrived, and Brown was not </p><p>sure but what the word he held by the tail </p><p>was some medical term.. So he—released </p><p>the struggling word, and went on smugly— </p><p>“At least we may be sure that to us the </p><p>allness is almost entirely without loquac— </p><p>loquacity-” </p><p> “I’ve got a mighty good loquat tree</p><p>back of my shop,” interrupted Bill Watson, </p><p>the blacksmith, “if that’s what you’re</p><p>talkin’ about.” </p><p> Doctor Cunningham tittered neatly.</p><p>Old Bill had innocently tripped up this </p><p>wordy stranger. Brown groped in a men- </p><p>tal fog, and finally gave up the idea of </p><p>awing the Hemperites with words, and </p><p>thus attempting to prove to Miss Wayne </p><p>that he was a man of her own caste. </p><p> The doctor ventured to relate some medi-</p><p>cal experiences, but no one evinced any </p><p>interest. Apparently the girl was not </p><p>aware of his existence, and the physician, </p><p>noting certain hostile glances from some </p><p>rugged males, decided to return to the </p><p>companionship of the skeleton in his dreary </p><p>office. </p><p> Having decided to call on Uncle Charlie’s</p><p>niece, the Reverend Nittin wrestled with </p><p>himself in prayer. He would interest her </p><p>in church work, and would refrain from </p><p>any wicked personal feelings. She was </p><p>beautiful beyond all power of words to </p><p>express, and he must fortify himself with </p><p>prayer ere he wandered within the range </p><p>of temptation. He was encumbered with </p><p>i8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>a peculiar egotism; he believed that tempta- </p><p>tion lurked in the highways to pounce upon </p><p>the pure and good. Yes, he would call, </p><p>and interest her in church work, and later, </p><p>if she insisted, he might make her his wife. </p><p>Her wealth would build a church,, and res- </p><p>cue him from starvation. </p><p> And so the little sheep man wandered</p><p>forth among the wolf and panther </p><p>men. </p><p> Hardy had joined the worshipers on the</p><p>porch, but had attempted no excuse. </p><p>When the Reverend Nittin arrived with a </p><p>murmured “Good evening,” the Hardy </p><p>brow darkened. He had thought of giving </p><p>the little preacher some money to build a </p><p>church, but now there would be none of </p><p>his gold forthcoming. He moved into the </p><p>light and stared malignantly at Nittin. </p><p>Norn, refreshed by his afternoon sleep, sat </p><p>in the shadowy corner of the porch farthest </p><p>from the girl. He smiled at the effect of </p><p>Hardy’s malignant stare. </p><p> “I took the liberty of calling on you,</p><p>Miss TVVlavne.’-Lh 1 eated the minister faintly, </p><p>-sfmrng to wrest his fascinated eyes from </p><p>Hardy’s hypnotic glare. “I feel that a </p><p>great deal of good can be accomplished </p><p>if-” </p><p> He seated himself gingerly.</p><p> Hardy hitched his chair closer to the</p><p>minister, and his dark eyes took on an </p><p>agate sheen. </p><p> “How are you this evening, Mr. Hardy?”</p><p>baaed the minister, his hands fluttering. </p><p> “I’m well as usual,” flung back Hardy,</p><p>chill menace in his voice. </p><p> The minister with a desperate effort,</p><p>wrenched his gaze from the gambler’s </p><p>gleaming eyes, and faced the girl. </p><p> “I trust, Sister Wayne-”</p><p> At this point, Dickie arose from his po-</p><p>sition at his sister’s feet, and faced the </p><p>minister truculently.</p><p> “She’s not your sister,” he asserted</p><p>shrilly. “She’s my sister, and don’t you </p><p>call her your sister.” </p><p> The boy seated himself on the arm of his</p><p>sister’s chair, and placed a jealous arm </p><p>around her neck. </p><p> The Reverend Nittin gasped, but man-</p><p>aged to bleat— </p><p> “No, no, my little man, I did not mean</p><p>she was my sister, except, in the sweetness </p><p>of our mutual-” </p><p> “Say, Miss Wayne,” blurted out the</p><p>blacksmith, “if that saddle hawse you’re </p><p>figgerin’ on buvin’ needs shoein’, bring him </p><p>down and I’ll fit him up right.” </p><p> “I believe the man who is to have the</p><p>care of the horse, will attend to that,” came </p><p>the cool reply. </p><p> The blacksmith’s turgid mind had la-</p><p>bored long on the proposition of shoeing </p><p>her horse. Blacksmithing was all he knew. </p><p>If she wasn’t interested in horse-shoeing, </p><p>the trail to her favor was closed to him. </p><p>Heavily he arose, and clumped away. </p><p> Nittin’s pallid soul shriveled under the</p><p>gambler’s burning gaze. He made a piti- </p><p>ful attempt to give his call the semblance </p><p>of sanity, but the panic of a frightened </p><p>fawn hurried his feet, as he murmured to </p><p>Dora, “So pleased to have met you,” and </p><p>fairly skipped off the porch. </p><p> A huge, bearded prospecter wandered in,</p><p>saw the girl, and stopped short. Then he </p><p>saw Norn in the shadow, and noted Hardy’s </p><p>questioning, hostile stare. </p><p> “Evenin’, Hank,” greeted Uncle Charlie.</p><p>“Set down. My niece, Miss Wayne.” </p><p> The huge man removed his dusty hat,</p><p>and gulped— </p><p> “Pleased to meet you.”</p><p> He seated himself carefully, and regarded</p><p>the girl blandly. </p><p> Oh, the power of woman to stir the</p><p>imagination! Hank, under the spell of </p><p>her beauty, recounted tales of lost mines, </p><p>and desperate days. He told of lurching </p><p>across treeless hells, and the visions that </p><p>then came to him of limpid pools, and cool </p><p>streams gurgling among the grasses. He </p><p>made gestures that any orator might envy, </p><p>and his deep voice took on the melody of a </p><p>chant as he recited his “Odyssey.” </p><p> Dickie listened open-mouthed, and the</p><p>girl smiled at the lad’s interest. </p><p> Hank suddenly realized that he was</p><p>merely amusing the boy. His egotism </p><p>collapsed. This was no place for liim, a </p><p>broken-down prospector who reeked of </p><p>greasewood smoke and burro-sweat. </p><p> He, too, arose heavily.</p><p> “Tliank him,” Dora whispered to Dickie,</p><p>“for telling you so many interesting </p><p>stories.” </p><p> The big man gulped at Dickie’s “Thank</p><p>you, Mr. Hank,” gave the girl a hopeless </p><p>look, and stumbled into the darkness. </p><p> Jed Holly, a smart deputy sheriff under</p><p>the thumb of Hardy, started to relate some </p><p>deeds of heroism, giving himself a careless </p><p>air. But the Hardy glare made him falter, </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>19 </p><p>and Uncle Charlie’s thundering laugh </p><p>blotted him out completely. </p><p> “To hear you talk, Jed,” boomed the</p><p>merciless old man, “a man’d think you had </p><p>a private buryin’-ground.” </p><p> “Jed likes to see his voice bounce,”</p><p>sneered Hardy. </p><p> Muttering vaguely, the deputy retreated</p><p>from the ever-narrowing circle. </p><p>ONE of Norn’s cowboys, who had </p><p>had several drinks of cheering and </p><p>ego-inflating liquor caught the gleam </p><p>oi the girl’s white dress, and paused in </p><p>front of the hotel, entranced by the beauty </p><p>of her face. He did not see Norn in the </p><p>shadowy corner. With chaps flapping, </p><p>spurs jingling, and six-shooter dangling, </p><p>he strode up on the porch. </p><p> “How’s old Uncle Charlie?” he cried</p><p>boisterously. </p><p> “Dan!”</p><p> The cowboy whirled as though a gun</p><p>had been fired at him. </p><p> “Oh, it’s you,” he bleated foolishly, as</p><p>he recognized Norn. </p><p> “You’re drunk,” said Norn in a low</p><p>voicc. “Move along.” </p><p> The cowboy slunk away.</p><p> “You keep your riders well in hand,</p><p>King,” complimented Uncle Charlie. </p><p> Then John Meeker, the jolly, rotund</p><p>keeper of the general store, joined the </p><p>circle on the porch. He had hurried to his </p><p>self-appointed tryst. The light through </p><p>the office window gleamed upon his head, </p><p>as innocent of hair as the ivory handle of </p><p>Norn’s six-shooter. </p><p> Uncle Charlie could not resist the temp-</p><p>tation. </p><p> “Jumpin’ bull-frogs, but you’re gettin’</p><p>balder every minute, Meeker!”</p><p> The old man ran his fingers through his</p><p>own thick gray thatch, and chuckled. </p><p> Now the storekeeper was most sensitive</p><p>concerning the nudity of his dome. For </p><p>him Uncle Charlie’s cruel remark carried </p><p>little poisoned insinuations that he was </p><p>passe and had no place among young and </p><p>vigorous men worshiping at the shrine of </p><p>beauty. And he had put on a clean collar </p><p>and sprayed himself liberally with some of </p><p>his best perfume. </p><p> Uncle Charlie sniffed.</p><p> “And you’re all perfumed up, too!</p><p>What’s this world a-comin’ to?” </p><p> The old man emitted a bellow of wild</p><p>laughter. Even the girl smiled. Hardy, </p><p>too, relaxed his rather tense pose, and gazed </p><p>at the storekeeper with amused, half- </p><p>closed eyes. </p><p> Meeker weakly attempted jocularity, but</p><p>displayed a pitiful lack of his wonted snap. </p><p>Perhaps, Hemper was right. He was old— </p><p>fifty-two last Fall. </p><p> But he managed to mumble to Uncle</p><p>Charlie— </p><p> “I just dropped down to tell you that I</p><p>got them canned pears you was askin’ for </p><p>the other day.” </p><p> Then he wandered off the porch and</p><p>paused irresolutely on the sidewalk. </p><p> “Better come back and get your hat,”</p><p>Uncle Charlie called. </p><p> Meeker started as from a trance, then</p><p>returned and secured his hat. </p><p> “What’s ailin’ you, John!” the landlord</p><p>twitted. “All het up and excited, and for- </p><p>gettin’ your hat. Without a hat—why, </p><p>you’re plum’ naked.” </p><p> The little man’s only thought now was</p><p>to escape. Wildly he looked back -2s he </p><p>started down the steps, missed his fooling, </p><p>and fell, floundering about on the sidewalk. </p><p> Dickie, with the thoughtlessness of the</p><p>very young, laughed shrilly. Uncle Char- </p><p>lie made no effort to restrain his mirth. </p><p> The storekeeper was badly bruised.</p><p>Norn leaped down and helped him to his </p><p>feet. In his fiounderings Meeker had shed </p><p>some toilet articles, a pocket comb, a tooth- </p><p>brush, a mirror, as well as sundry keys, </p><p>pencils and other articles necessary to a </p><p>man of his trade-rat habits. These, Norn </p><p>gathered up and stuck in the pockets of the </p><p>bewildered man. Then, aiming him in the </p><p>desired direction, he gave the little man a </p><p>gentle shove. Meeker zigzagged toward </p><p>his store with the halting steps of a sleep- </p><p>walker. </p><p> Gritting his teeth on a persistent grin,</p><p>Norn returned to his dark corner. </p><p> Mrs. Milliken, the nurse, came and</p><p>bundled Dickie off to bed. </p><p> Presently Uncle Charlie yawned por-</p><p>tentiously, and retired, leaving the big </p><p>office lamp burning for the benefit of those </p><p>he called “the night owls.” </p><p> The girl moved her chair over to the rail,</p><p>and looked out through the cottonwoods </p><p>into the mysterious country beyond. </p><p> Norn saw a prospector across the street</p><p>whom he had grub-staked, and walked </p><p>over to chat with him. </p><p>20 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Brown, the persistent, moved his chair to</p><p>a position opposite the girl, and settled </p><p>down for a cosy tete-a-tete. </p><p> The girl turned her head with a little</p><p>gesture of weariness. </p><p> Brown began babbling of riding horses</p><p>and of mountain scenery. The girl raised </p><p>a silencing hand. </p><p> “I prefer to be alone,” she said.</p><p> There was no acidity in her tones, just</p><p>weariness. She was tired of the G. </p><p>Holden Browns; she had known droves of </p><p>them. </p><p> “But I assure you, Miss Wayne-”</p><p> The girl arose and walked away from</p><p>him, and off the porch. Brown looked </p><p>after her, half-minded to follow, but </p><p>Hardy’s chill voice knifed that thought. </p><p> “Does it take a piece of lead before you</p><p>know you’re not wanted?” </p><p> Brown’s reply made Hardy stare at him</p><p>in wonderment. What queer words the </p><p>fat man released! </p><p> “Your insinuations are uncalled for,”</p><p>sai'i jj1--loftily. </p><p>"TlTough Brown had seen Uncle Charlie </p><p>in action, and had noted the swift punish- </p><p>ment of Bundy, his hot-house egotism </p><p>blinded him to the fact that he was not in </p><p>a country, policed and guarded, where a </p><p>man might make cutting remarks and es- </p><p>cape physical injury. He had come from </p><p>the East as the representative of a well- </p><p>organized band of land-sharks who re- </p><p>garded California, with its confusion in </p><p>land and water titles, a rich field for their </p><p>questionable operations. He believed that </p><p>a man could do anything so long as he kept </p><p>within the law. His mind was not con- </p><p>structed for noting primitive facts. The </p><p>law would always protect him. He did </p><p>not know that his reply to the gambler’s </p><p>question was like the prattle of a child </p><p>playing with a rattlesnake. </p><p> “I don’t get your line of talk,” Hardy</p><p>said, after darkly studying the fat man for </p><p>several moments. “But I wouldn’t make </p><p>any false moves around this camp, if I was </p><p>you. Somebody might open you.” </p><p> The man was getting personal again,</p><p>thought Brown, happily unaware that the </p><p>Hardy expression, “Somebody might open </p><p>you” meant quick, merciless knife-work. </p><p>He decided not to bandy words with a low </p><p>gambler; and marched swiftly past Hardy, </p><p>and up to his room. </p><p> “Queer bird,” mused the gambler aloud.</p><p>Then to Twill—“What you and the fat </p><p>slug so thick about?” </p><p> “He’s interested in the resources of the</p><p>country,” Twill replied unctuously, for he </p><p>feared Hardy. </p><p> “Uh, huh,” muttered the gambler.</p><p>TWILL was thankful when the girl </p><p>returned to her chair by the porch </p><p>rail and freed him from the gam- </p><p>bler’s somber, questioning gaze. The law- </p><p>yer slipped up to Brown’s room, having </p><p>some unfinished business with that gentle- </p><p>man. </p><p> Brown opened the door and yawned in</p><p>the lawyer’s face. </p><p> “I thought we’d better go over that</p><p>matter more carefully,” said Twill, with a </p><p>death’s-head smirk, and edging past Brown </p><p>into the room. </p><p> He popped a finger to get into action.</p><p>“Norn has never thought it necessary to </p><p>file on the water. Besides, as I’ve told you, </p><p>the stream heads beyond the northern </p><p>boundaries of the old Mexican grant se- </p><p>cured by Norn's father.” </p><p> “That’s the one point that bothers me,”</p><p>Brown admitted. “What maps I’ve had </p><p>access to show the water heading outside </p><p>the grant. But there has been no Govern- </p><p>ment survey of that country. The old </p><p>Mexican grant boundaries were designated </p><p>by natural objects, hills and such tilings, </p><p>and are very unsatisfactory from a legal </p><p>standpoint. You say you have been over </p><p>the Norn ranch, and know the boundaries?”</p><p>“Yes, yes,” lied the lawyer glibly, his </p><p>mind intent on the fee Brown had promised. </p><p> He was in desperate need of money, and</p><p>was as devoid of conscience as a famished </p><p>dog. </p><p> “Well,” Brown decided, “I’ll see for</p><p>myself. What do you suppose Norn will </p><p>do when he finds I have secured control of </p><p>the water?” </p><p> Twill licked his lips nervously,, and at-</p><p>tacked the main issue. </p><p> “I have had some financial difficulties,”</p><p>he nimbly sidestepped. “Could you see </p><p>your way clear to advance me, say, a hun- </p><p>dred dollars?” </p><p> Following Twill’s departure, Hardy de-</p><p>cided to show his hand. He seated himself </p><p>on the rail near the girl, and began: </p><p> “Miss Dora, I'm used to speakin’ my</p><p>mind.” The girl stirred uneasily. “I’m </p><p>not a poor man. I may not have as much </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>21 </p><p>money as some men, but I’ve plenty.” </p><p>Then, in his ignorance of the type of woman </p><p>he was addressing, he added impressively, </p><p>“And I’d marry you.” </p><p> Her reply held the tinkle of steel on ice.</p><p> “You honor me. I infer that you do</p><p>not usually make such a generous offer. </p><p>But I have no interest in you or your </p><p>affairs, Mr. Hardy.” </p><p> She arose, and a little flicker of light</p><p>from the lamp in the office brought out the </p><p>carven beauty of her face. A faint glimpse </p><p>of futility came to the dark-faced gambler, </p><p>some realization that she was as far above </p><p>him as heaven itself. </p><p> As she turned to go, she glanced back at</p><p>him impersonally. </p><p> It came to Hardy that he was only one</p><p>of the many who had shattered their hopes </p><p>on the rock of her indifference. He wanted </p><p>to strangle her, but her cool, impersonal </p><p>gaze held him motionless. He watched </p><p>her enter the office, and then fled, cursing </p><p>madly. </p><p> Returning to the plotters up-stairs.</p><p>Twill’s request for cash made Brown wince. </p><p>The lawyer had been of considerable value </p><p>to him, but there was a predatory gleam in </p><p>the funereal one’s eye that the fat man did </p><p>not like. He put him off with many </p><p>questions, but insistently the lawyer re- </p><p>turned to the main issue. </p><p> “A hundred dollars is most necessary to</p><p>my welfare at this time,” was the burden </p><p>of the lawyer’s refrain. </p><p> Finally the land-shark sighed resignedly,</p><p>and removed a fat billbook from his coat </p><p>hanging on the bedpost. He counted out </p><p>the money and passed the bills to the </p><p>lawyer. Then he yawned meaningly. </p><p> Twill opened the door and stood there</p><p>for a moment. There was a tiny lamp </p><p>burning in the hall, but the lawyer failed </p><p>1o see the dark, little figure approaching </p><p>him. Maria saw the lawyer in the door- </p><p>way and paused back of him in the shadow.</p><p>She was not eavesdropping; it was just her </p><p>shy Indian way. The man would go in a </p><p>moment, and then she would slip down to </p><p>the cabin back of the kitchen to say good- </p><p>night to her mother before returning to her </p><p>little room adjoining the bedroom of her </p><p>mistress. </p><p> “Norn hasn’t a shadow of a legal right</p><p>to the water,” asseverated the lawyer, </p><p>having in mind the balance of his fee. </p><p> Maria, when she heard the name of the</p><p>man she adored, became tense and alert. </p><p>She did not gather the full import of Twill’s </p><p>words, but she felt intuitively that the man </p><p>in the doorway meant no good toward the </p><p>man who had brought her the mocking-bird. </p><p> Brown grunted a sleepy “Good-night.”</p><p>Twill slipped stealthily down the hall, </p><p>passing Dora on the stairway. </p><p>NORN had returned to the porch, </p><p>and, as the lawyer shambled past </p><p>him, he groped for the cause of </p><p>Twill’s nocturnal habits. What had the </p><p>lawyer been doing up-stairs? </p><p> Then from the end of the porch a soft</p><p>voice hailed him. He smiled as the light </p><p>fell on the brown, earnest face of Maria. </p><p> He sauntered over to her.</p><p> “Well, little brown one, what can I do</p><p>for you?” </p><p> “Me come tell you Twill him talk wiz</p><p>big fat man in room. Twill him say—” </p><p>and she parroted the lawyer’s words— </p><p>“ ‘Norn hasn’t shadow legal right to water.’ </p><p>Me come down fast back stairs:” -Then in </p><p>Spanish, “The words were not good worcfS: ” </p><p> She smiled up at him adoringly. Norn</p><p>seated himself on the rail and put his arm </p><p>about the girl’s shoulder. He meant noth- </p><p>ing by the caress other than a simple ap- </p><p>preciation of the loyalty of a child. She </p><p>was his friend. </p><p> As Dora entered her room, she missed</p><p>her scarf, and called Maria. Meeting with </p><p>no response, she decided to return to the </p><p>porch; doubtless she had dropped the scarf </p><p>there. She was not sleepy, and was half-</p><p>inclined to take another stroll. </p><p> Softly she opened the office door and</p><p>glided out on the porch. She halted </p><p>abruptly, as she recognized Norn and </p><p>Maria, and noted the position of his arm </p><p>and the Indian girl’s adoration. Then, as </p><p>she realized that it hurt her strangely to </p><p>see his arm about the girl, she fled to the </p><p>bleak heights of Puritanism. Norn, the </p><p>wealthy cattleman, was playing with a </p><p>simple Indian girl. The man was a beast </p><p>—and worse, since he knew the tenets of </p><p>decent society. </p><p> Maria was looking up in the face of the</p><p>pondering man with intense and worship- </p><p>ful earnestness. </p><p> “I’ll never forget what you have done</p><p>for me, Maria,” he said slowly. </p><p> Dora’s heart contracted in a spasm of</p><p>pain—pain for the trusting Indian maid. </p><p>22 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>But he would forget what the girl had done </p><p>for him; a man always forgets. </p><p> Then Maria lowered her eyes and met</p><p>the cold, accusing gaze of her mistress. </p><p>She did not know that that cold, accusing </p><p>gaze was for Norn, and she fled precipi- </p><p>tately to her parents’ cabin, not daring to </p><p>return to her room, dreading the mysterious </p><p>anger of the beautiful white woman. </p><p> “Pardon me for interrupting, but I</p><p>dropped my scarf-” </p><p> Norn faced her puzzedly. What cause</p><p>had she to address him with such accen- </p><p>tuated hauteur? </p><p> He found the scarf and gave it to her.</p><p>She thanked him coldly. </p><p> “Amusing yourself with a simple child,”</p><p>she heard herself say, “is hardly the part </p><p>of a man who pretends chivalry-” </p><p> Norn raised his hand in a sharp, quick</p><p>gesture, and for the life of her she could not </p><p>go on. Neither could she meet his search- </p><p>ing gaze. She had expected to see him </p><p>cower before the flame of her sarcasm; </p><p>instead, hejadiated an. anger that appalled </p><p> “Look at me!”</p><p> His tone was like the whisper of a swift</p><p>sword. </p><p> Slowly she raised her eyes. The man’s</p><p>face was granite; in his eyes were dancing </p><p>points of light; his lips were thin-drawn, </p><p>and about the nostrils were shadows that </p><p>flowed up to merge with the shadows be- </p><p>neath the eyes, giving his face the look of </p><p>a portrait done boldly in black and white. </p><p> Fear came to her; not physical fear, but</p><p>the keen spiritual fear that leaves the soul </p><p>quaking with dread. </p><p> What had she said? Oh, yes, the man</p><p>was guilty of an offense against the rules </p><p>of decent society. </p><p> Norn whirled abruptly and strode into</p><p>the darkness.</p><p> She sank into a chair, struggling to re-</p><p>tain her foothold on the peak of Puritan- </p><p>ism. She would rescue Maria, lift her up </p><p>tenderly from the depths. . . But the man’s </p><p>eyes—those frank, terrible eyes? Perhaps </p><p>he wasn’t guilty; that tiny thought gave </p><p>her an unreasonable joy. Then back to the </p><p>bleak heights; he was guilty. Had he not </p><p>voiced the ancient lying litany, “I’ll never </p><p>forget?” </p><p> Wearily she returned to her room, sigh-</p><p>ing under an imagined burden of respon- </p><p>sibility. She would rescue Maria, the </p><p>poor, blind, foolish child; and treat the </p><p>man with silent contempt. Yet, she was </p><p>forced to admit, it would be difficult to </p><p>treat with silent contempt a man who </p><p>steadfastly refrained from entering the </p><p>trap of words. To be treated with silent </p><p>contempt, a man must intrude. She could </p><p>not recall the slightest intrusion on Norn’s </p><p>part. Then she realized that she was not </p><p>thinking clearly, that one set of vague </p><p>thoughts were battling another set equally </p><p>vague, and that she was very sleepy. </p><p> An hour later, Norn entered his room,</p><p>and drew off his boots. He was calm now, </p><p>recognizing that his position was impreg- </p><p>nable. She had judged him who was guilt- </p><p>less, on flimsy circumstantial evidence. </p><p>In time she would discover the wrong she </p><p>had done him, and, being what she was, </p><p>would have to come to him to right that </p><p>wrong. That would mean no small struggle </p><p>on her part, and in the meantime she would </p><p>be thinking of him. He would make no </p><p>move toward her, speak no word. He </p><p>would hold himself aloof, confining himself </p><p>to action in the man-life. </p><p> There was G. Holden Brown with his</p><p>water - grabbing scheme. Well, Brown </p><p>knew something of the value of water, but </p><p>his education in that line was incomplete. </p><p>It might be well to add to the fat man’s </p><p>knowledge a more intimate understanding </p><p>of the preciousness of the fluid. He smiled </p><p>peacefully as he fell asleep. </p><p>CHAPTER V </p><p>BUNDY’S camp at the foot of </p><p>Witch-talk was sheltered from the </p><p>west wind that frequently howled</p><p>through the pass, and was an eye-gladden- </p><p>ing spot to men coming in from the desert </p><p>wastes. At the head of the canon, at the </p><p>mouth of which was the camp, a waterfall </p><p>effectually barred the way. The stream </p><p>ended in a pool near the camp. About the </p><p>pool wild grass grew luxuriantly and alder </p><p>trees offered shade and shelter. </p><p> The gang was full-fed, having just gorged</p><p>on roast mountain sheep flavored with bacon. </p><p>They were smoking and lounging about the </p><p>fire. Bundy lowered in the shadow, sore in </p><p>heart and body. </p><p> While they were eating, the members of</p><p>the gang had given Bundy a short rest from </p><p>their cruel gibes concerning his lady-killing </p><p>powers and his marvelous fighting ability. </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>2 3 </p><p>But now, as they lounged about the fire, </p><p>they resumed their prodding of their ex- </p><p>chief, for Pete had not omitted informing </p><p>them that Hardy had told him to “look </p><p>after things.” </p><p> “Bundy overlooked a bet,” one declared,</p><p>fislung for a laugh. “He’s got a good pair </p><p>of legs, and should have let Norn take after </p><p>him. Then all he’d had to do was to run </p><p>Norn to death.” </p><p> Another suggested that Bundy should</p><p>have dug a hole and “pulled the hole in </p><p>after him,” and thus compelled Norn to </p><p>•work himself to death diggin’ him </p><p>out.” </p><p> “Wonder what he was lookin’ for when</p><p>you found him, Pete?” a hawk-nosed hu- </p><p>morist asked, innocently. “You said he </p><p>was down on all fours lookin’ around for </p><p>something.” </p><p> “Tryin’ to find his courage-”</p><p> “Here, here,” reproved Pete, now realiz-</p><p>ing that there was nothing to be gained by </p><p>rubbing salt into the wounds of Bundy. </p><p>“Let up. Bundy’s not the only one that </p><p>lost out with a girl.” </p><p> “Yes, that’s right,” agreed the hawk-</p><p>nosed humorist. “Billy there, got a pan of </p><p>dish-water and a dose of hot grease for his </p><p>trouble.” </p><p> Pete laughed. The Indian was of little</p><p>or no value. He now saw it would be poor </p><p>policy to antagonize Bundy to the extent of </p><p>forcing him out of the gang. He half-re- </p><p>gretted that he had not been more diplo- </p><p>matic in his treatment of the fallen chief. </p><p>Therefore his attempt to divert the fire of </p><p>caustic comment to the Indian. </p><p> He proceeded to encourage them in the</p><p>bantei- j of Billy Snake who, as he became </p><p>the targe for their gibes, drew back sul- </p><p>lenly into the darkness. </p><p> “Yes,” he drawled, “Billy sure has hard</p><p>luck winnin’ a squaw. He knows that an </p><p>Injun who can’t get a squaw is no man a- </p><p>tall.”</p><p> He finished with a loud, raucous laugh.</p><p>The hawk-nosed humorist twisted around </p><p>lazily, and taunted: </p><p> “Hey, Billy, you’ll be an old man before</p><p>you get a squaw. What’s the matter with </p><p>you—no good? Guess old Chang’s got you </p><p>scared out.” </p><p> Their words bit deep into the savage</p><p>heart of Billy Snake. So they thought he </p><p>was not a man because he couldn’t get a </p><p>squaw. And the yellow man had thrown </p><p>hot grease on him as a squaw throws rub- </p><p>bish on an intruding dog. Aye, and the </p><p>squaw had dishonored him with filthy wa- </p><p>ter. Well, he would prove to them all that </p><p>he was a warrior—a man who could get a </p><p>squaw. </p><p> Discouraged by the Indian’s silence, the</p><p>gang left off chaffing him, and returned to </p><p>the subject of Bundy’s various weaknesses, </p><p>taunting him, despite Pete’s grumbled ob- </p><p>jections, until they rolled up in their., </p><p>blankets. </p><p> When the last man was asleep, including</p><p>the bruised and battered Bundy who </p><p>groaned even in slumber, the Indian ex- </p><p>amined his rifle and slipped from the camp. </p><p>He ran as swiftly as a coyote, and three </p><p>hours before dawn stood among the cotton- </p><p>woods near the Hemper House. Then, like </p><p>a shadow he glided across the yard, and </p><p>paused near the door of the Indians’ cabin, </p><p>listening intently. Softly he opened the </p><p>door. The cage that held Maria’s mocking </p><p>bird hung near the window. Billy Snake </p><p>fumbled with the tiny door of—cage. </p><p>Presently he wormed in a slim hand/Icmid </p><p>the bird and squeezed its life out. </p><p> His next move was to clutch the throat</p><p>of Maria, lest, as she awoke, her screams </p><p>rouse the white men. The girl opened her </p><p>eyes as the lean fingers dug into her soft </p><p>neck. Her forlorn sob was cut short by the </p><p>tightening of the implacable fingers. </p><p> “Silence!” hissed the Indian in Spanish.</p><p>“The Snake hath come for thee!” </p><p> He punched her with his rifle, threatening</p><p>her with death if she did not instantly obey </p><p>his orders. She had lain down fully dressed,</p><p>with the exception of her shoes; and now </p><p>sat up on the edge of the bed, shivering </p><p>with nameless terror. Billy stooped and </p><p>felt around for her shoes, and placed them </p><p>in her trembling hands. He jammed the </p><p>rifle-barrel against her breast. She drew </p><p>on her shoes, choking back the sobs that </p><p>reached her. </p><p> Billy Snake seized the girl’s arm, and</p><p>dragged her to the door. At that moment </p><p>Maria’s father awoke and gave a startled </p><p>yell which roused the mother who immedi- </p><p>ately began screeching. The desperate </p><p>savage dragged the girl back with him, and </p><p>with venomous threats of death silenced the </p><p>old Indians to quaking hummocks of flesh </p><p>beneath the bed covers. </p><p> Then, jerking the girl through the door-</p><p>way, he punched her viciously with his </p><p>24 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>rifle, and drove her ahead of him into the </p><p>night. </p><p> The Indian and-his captive were far be-</p><p>yond the precints of Hemper, ere Maria’s </p><p>father ventured to pull back the covers </p><p>from his face. The fat, old Ivawia was not </p><p>made of warrior stuff, being reduced by the </p><p>missions and civilization to a soft blubber </p><p>that dreaded the hiss of steel or the whine </p><p>of lead. Sucking in his breath noisily, he </p><p>slowly turned his head, and peered dread- </p><p>fully about the cabin. Then he touched </p><p>his mammoth squaw who lay in a dumb, </p><p>sweating trance of fear. </p><p> “Snake has taken our child,” he bubbled</p><p>in Kawia. </p><p> The squaw sprang from the bed with</p><p>startling swiftness and began running </p><p>wildly about the room, screeching and wail- </p><p>ing. The old Indian added his vocal efforts </p><p>to those of the distracted mother, and the </p><p>little cabin became a bedlam of yelps, howls </p><p>and screeches. </p><p> Norn, ever a light sleeper, awoke, lis-</p><p>tener! for n moment to the caterwauling is- </p><p>stfiHfl'lioni the cabin, and dressed hurriedly. </p><p>He threw up the window which overlooked </p><p>the roof of the kitchen, crawled through, </p><p>slipped down the roof and dropped to the </p><p>ground. </p><p> Out of ’the various yelps and screeches</p><p>emitted by the frantic Indians, Norn man- </p><p>aged to gather that Billy Snake had </p><p>abducted Maria. He wasted no time in </p><p>soothing the distracted parents, but raced </p><p>to the stable, saddled his horse, made sure </p><p>his arms and ammunition were in fit condi- </p><p>tion, and racked warily into the desert. </p><p> Uncle Charlie was aroused by the clamor</p><p>of the Indians, and managed to calm </p><p>Maria's father sufficiently to get the facts. </p><p>He noted the lifeless mocking bird, and his </p><p>old mouth twisted wickedly. </p><p> “An Injun trick,” he muttered; and re-</p><p>turned to tire hotel to array himself for the </p><p>trail. </p><p>DORA had been awakened by the</p><p>outcries of the Indians, but Dickie </p><p>slept through it all. She put on a </p><p>robe, and hurried down-stairs where she </p><p>met her uncle. </p><p> “Billy Snake, that Piute that Chang</p><p>throwed the grease on, has stole Maria,” the </p><p>old man yelled, before she could question </p><p>him. “Killed her mocker, too, the red </p><p>hound!” </p><p> “Why, what does it mean?” she quav-</p><p>ered. </p><p> “It means,” roared the old man impati-</p><p>ently, as he clawed about for his shoes, </p><p>“that Maria is started on the first lap of the </p><p>trail to hell.” </p><p> “What is to be done?” she gasped.</p><p>“Done?” grunted Uncle Charlie, tugging </p><p>at his shoes. “Kill the Injun or get him, </p><p>and hang him.” Then he cursed viciously </p><p>as a shoe lace broke. </p><p> “Why, uncle!” gasped the shocked girl.</p><p> “ ‘Why, uncle,’-,” bawled the now-</p><p>frantic old man. “Is this a time for a </p><p>niece of mine to be namby-pamby? Gawd </p><p>help you, girl, with your pin-headed idees! </p><p>Go get my rifle. Limpin’ sufferin’ Judas, </p><p>where in the good dangnation did I put </p><p>them six-shooter shells!” </p><p> Dora found herself dragging the heavy</p><p>rifle from its corner. She returned to her </p><p>uncle, humble, and wanting to be of service. </p><p>He was going forth to trail down a desper- </p><p>ate savage. </p><p> “Norn’s already gone,” fumed the old</p><p>man, struggling with a refractory belt. </p><p>“Norn’ll get that Injun if he’s to be got. </p><p>Maria has been under that boy’s wing since </p><p>she was a baby. Reg’ler big brother to her </p><p>—figgerin’ on sendin’ her East to school. </p><p>Now, give me that gun.” </p><p> G. Holden Brown came to the foot of the</p><p>stairs. </p><p> “Hey, you Brown,” yelled Uncle Char-</p><p>lie, as he came from his room in full war- </p><p>gear, “you’d better come to the hardware </p><p>store with me and get a rifle. Billy Snake’s </p><p>stole Maria, and we’ll need plenty of men.”</p><p>“Well, really, Mr. Hemper, suck </p><p>work-” </p><p> “All right; if your feet are cold,” Uncle</p><p>Charlie cut in wickedly, “stay iu lied and </p><p>keep ’em warm.” </p><p> The old warrior waddled forth to gather</p><p>up a posse. </p><p> Brown rolled into bed, and tucked the</p><p>covers about him snugly. The abduction </p><p>of an Indian squaw was nothing to him. </p><p>Indians were mere animals anyway. Then </p><p>he remembered that he had not locked his </p><p>door. He arose, lighted the lamp, and fum- </p><p>bled for the key. It came to him that the </p><p>guest rooms of the Hemper House were </p><p>destitute of keys, and he placed a chair </p><p>against the door. Not that he was fearful, </p><p>oh, no! He simply felt that doors were made </p><p>to be locked. </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>25 </p><p> Gloomy specters arose in the mind of</p><p>Dora to point accusing fingers at 'her cring- </p><p>ing Puritanism, and to mock the narrow- </p><p>mindedness that had hastened her sarcastic </p><p>and unsubstantiated condemnation of Norn. </p><p>Now, she knew the man was guiltless, being </p><p>merely a friend and protector of the Indian </p><p>girl. Even now he was risking his life to </p><p>save the little brown maid. Then, the spec- </p><p>ters gibbered, she was largely responsible </p><p>for Maria’s plight. Her accusing look, </p><p>meant for Norn, had frightened the shy </p><p>Maria into sleeping in the cabin instead of </p><p>seeking her little room where she would </p><p>have been beyond the reach of the savage. </p><p> What must Norn now think of her? She,</p><p>who had looked out calmly on the world of </p><p>men, noting impersonally their struttings, </p><p>their tricks, their solemn buffoonery, had </p><p>proved to be without wisdom, considera- </p><p>tion, or even that fine intuition supposed to </p><p>be woman’s peculiar quality. </p><p> There was only one path to follow, the</p><p>way of humbleness. She would, at the first </p><p>opportunity, explain all to him, leaving </p><p>nothing unsaid, however much it hurt her </p><p>pride or thorned her woman’s dignity. </p><p> As for Maria, she would pray for her—•</p><p>what else was there to do? And, if— </p><p>what concentrated sorrow and suffering </p><p>that little word held—if Norn rescued the </p><p>child, she, Dora Wayne, would vie with him </p><p>in making smooth the path of Maria. The </p><p>Indian girl would be educated and given </p><p>every advantage. </p><p> Then, helplessly, she contemplated the</p><p>fact that all her humbleness, all her good </p><p>resolves were due to the staggering blow </p><p>her faulty judgment had received. She </p><p>was not naturally considerate or good. </p><p>Mercilessly she lashed herself. She had </p><p>only a superficial knowledge of life. She </p><p>had been a snob condemning snobs, an </p><p>egotist condemning egotists. Oh, what </p><p>must Norn, the cold-eyed and silent man, </p><p>think of her! </p><p> She found that she could not sleep, so</p><p>she woke Dickie, and told him of the </p><p>abduction of Maria. </p><p> “I wish I were a man—I just wish I</p><p>were,” he whimpered, wagging his head </p><p>savagely. “I’d take a gun, and bring </p><p>Maria back to you. I bet Mr. Norn will </p><p>make that old Indian feel sorry. Did </p><p>Uncle Charlie go, too?” </p><p> “Yes, dear.”</p><p> “And Mr. Brown?”</p><p> “No, laddie; Mr. Brown was afraid.”</p><p>“Yes,” sneered Dickie, the courageous, </p><p>“he’s too fat.” </p><p> The girl smiled wanly, thankful for the</p><p>dauntless soul in Dickie’s weak little body. </p><p> “Mr. Norn will make that old Indian feel</p><p>sorry,” Dickie repeated solemnly. </p><p> Norn, thought the girl, always Norn.</p><p>She bowed humbly before the god of action. </p><p>Norn did not talk; he acted. All thought, </p><p>all word juggling, all opinion-launching, </p><p>were as so much gray dust before vibrant, </p><p>glowing action. King Norn was action </p><p>personified. Even Dickie could see that. </p><p>The man was ever in motion, not to be </p><p>halted, not to be stayed. This, to her, </p><p>seemed touched with dim shadow. Sup- </p><p>pose some woman should love him, could </p><p>she—could she hold him? </p><p> Suddenly she threw her arms about the</p><p>wondering Dickie, and hugged him close. </p><p>The lad made a clumsy effort to soothe her. </p><p> “Don’t worry, sweet little sister,” he</p><p>comforted, smoothing her hair, “Mr. Norn </p><p>will bring Maria back to you.!!_ </p><p> And so they waited for the dawh.</p><p>NORN knew that Billy Snake </p><p>would not take Maria to any resort </p><p>of the Bundy gang. An Indian </p><p>who steals a woman puts not his trust in </p><p>white men. </p><p> The Indian might hold to the Witch-talk</p><p>side of the pass, and venture across the </p><p>basin to the desert hills; or he might round </p><p>the shoulder of Rain-maker, and cross to </p><p>the hills in the vicinity of his—Norn’s— </p><p>ranch. </p><p> Norn decided to keep to the Witch-talk</p><p>side until he came to the jutting crags that </p><p>protected the Bundy camp. Reaching the </p><p>crags, he would then ride back toward his </p><p>ranch. By that time it would be light </p><p>enough for trailing. Meanwhile, he must </p><p>face the chance of a shot from Billy Snake. </p><p> Dawn found him swinging back toward</p><p>his ranch, convinced that the Indian had </p><p>kept to the Rain-maker side of the basin. </p><p>He struck the trail where Maria and the </p><p>Indian had crossed the ranch road and </p><p>headed scross the basin toward Twenty- </p><p>eight Palms, a water-hole about four miles </p><p>from the desert hills. He dismounted, and </p><p>closely examined the tracks. Maria was </p><p>ahead; Billy was evidently driving her. </p><p>Her tracks were little troughs in the sand, </p><p>indicating fatigue. The Indian’s tracks </p><p>26 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>were clean-cut; he was not beginning to </p><p>tire, and was yet able to travel many long, </p><p>hot miles. </p><p> The rancher followed the trail with great</p><p>caution; he knew the Indian trick of </p><p>doubling back to ambush a pursuer. </p><p> At Twenty-eight Palms he found some</p><p>remnants of rabbit fur and skin. The </p><p>Indian, to save ammunition, had clubbed </p><p>a cottontail and eaten it raw. Billy Snake </p><p>had one meal the better of it, but that did </p><p>not matter. </p><p> Norn resolved to turn his horse loose.</p><p>Billy was now probably snugly ensconced </p><p>in some safe look-out in the hills, some </p><p>point of vantage from which he would be </p><p>able to sight the pinto horse at a sufficient </p><p>distance to cover trail or plan ambush. </p><p>True, the Indian could see a man on foot, </p><p>but not at the distance he could discern </p><p>the horse. The pinto could find grass and </p><p>water near the palms. Lastly, a horse was </p><p>practically useless in following a man on </p><p>foot through the desert hills. </p><p> As Norn followed the trail toward the</p><p>the country became more desolate. </p><p>Great washes, strewn with boulders, de- </p><p>bouched from the hills. Here and there </p><p>barrel cactuses lifted hairy shapes that </p><p>seemed instinct with hideous intelligence. </p><p>Between the washes swarmed the cholla, </p><p>green and flourishing, drawing from some </p><p>mysterious source a vitality that mocked </p><p>the less-favored growths, dead and withered </p><p>in that sun-baked, waterless land. </p><p> The trail of Billy Snake led into one of</p><p>the gloomy canons that extended rib-wise </p><p>from the back of the desert range that </p><p>gradually rose to merge with Rain-maker. </p><p> Norn paused and considered the ways</p><p>of Indians. Would Billy follow the canon </p><p>he had entered and cross the back of the </p><p>range, or would he cross over to the canon </p><p>on the south? Certainly the Indian would </p><p>not turn toward Rain-maker. Had he </p><p>intended to hide in the fastnesses of the </p><p>timbered mountain, the Indian would have </p><p>headed straight toward the peak. He </p><p>concluded that Billy Snake would do the</p><p>most baffling thing: follow the canon for </p><p>a short distance, then turn up a rocky </p><p>tributary, and cross over to an equally </p><p>rocky tributary to the canon on the south. </p><p> The rancher resolved to enter the south</p><p>canon, and keep close to the north wall. </p><p>If Billy had not crossed over, he would </p><p>follow the canon up to the back of the range, </p><p>and, turning north, strike the Indian’s </p><p>trail. </p><p> Billy had done what Norn had surmised.</p><p>The Indian had turned south up a tribu- </p><p>tary canon, stepping carefully from boulder </p><p>to boulder, forcing the girl to imitate his </p><p>trail-trickery. As they reached the head of </p><p>the tributary, Billy halted and peered over </p><p>a shrub at the desert basin below him. He </p><p>hissed a sibilant warning to the girl as he </p><p>glimpsed a man approaching the mouth of </p><p>the big canon to the south. </p><p> Long he studied the approaching figure,</p><p>noting a certain familiarity in the carriage </p><p>and dress. Then, as the man entered the </p><p>canon, the Indian recognized him. So the </p><p>mocking-bird-giver thought to wrest the </p><p>woman from him. Billy’s lips drew back </p><p>from his white teeth. Now was his oppor- </p><p>tunity to count, as was the custom of his </p><p>fathers, a mighty coup. He had stolen a </p><p>woman from a hostile camp; a deed which </p><p>the boldest warrior might recount with </p><p>pride. Now he would kill a white man, </p><p>and give to himself the honors of a chief. </p><p> “Norn,” he mocked his victim, “seeks</p><p>the Mocking Bird that she may sing for </p><p>him, but, lo”—and he patted his rifle— </p><p>“this shall sing him to sleep.” </p><p> The girl gave him a look of deathless hate,</p><p>and then her tear-streaked face grew dull, </p><p>void alike of hope or despair. </p><p> As Norn disappeared in the mouth of the</p><p>canon, Billy Snake punched the girl with </p><p>his rifle. Her skirt was in rags where it </p><p>had caught on cactus and mesquite; her </p><p>back was a mass of bruises where he had </p><p>punched her with his rifle; her waist was </p><p>tom from her shoulders, and there were </p><p>marks as of claws on her breasts. She had </p><p>passed through enough torture to kill a </p><p>white woman; yet, despoiled, bruised and </p><p>bloody, and hopeless, she plodded on.</p><p> The floods had wedged in several huge</p><p>boulders at the mouth of the tributary </p><p>canon where Billy hoped to ambush Norn. </p><p>The main canon, smooth-walled, turned </p><p>some twenty paces beyond the boulder- </p><p>clogged mouth of the tributary. The </p><p>white man for that distance would be at a </p><p>distinct disadvantage. </p><p> The Indian, traveling a more direct route</p><p>than Norn, reached the mouth of the </p><p>tributary several minutes before the white </p><p>man, hugging the north wall, came to the </p><p>abrupt turn. Here, Norn halted, recog- </p><p>nizing the turn as an ideal place for an </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>2 7 </p><p>ambush. Yet he must go forward. </p><p>Crouching low, his rifle at the ready, he </p><p>leaped around the turn. </p><p> At that instant, Maria, calling on the</p><p>last shred of her strength, sprang over the </p><p>boulders, and threw herself toward the </p><p>white man, screaming: </p><p> “Norn! Norn! Norn!”</p><p> Billy Snake, in a mad frenzy, raised up</p><p>and fired from the hip at the girl. Even </p><p>as she slumped, Norn’s rifle mingled its </p><p>withering crack with the bellow of Billy’s </p><p>old Springfield, and, before the echoes -died, </p><p>the Indian fell, his head in plain sight of the </p><p>white man. </p><p> Norn leaped over the boulders to make</p><p>sure the Indian was not shamming death, </p><p>and then sprang back to Maria. </p><p> She was alive but she would soon tread</p><p>the way of souls. Norn lifted her up, rest- </p><p>ing her head against his knee. He did not </p><p>examine the wound; her face told him she </p><p>was doomed. </p><p> The Mocking Bird looked up into the face</p><p>of the man she had loved ever since she was </p><p>a solemn-eyed baby. </p><p> “Aye,” she sighed in Spanish, “thou</p><p>thought to save me, yet soon shall the </p><p>Mocking Bird fly far away from thee.” </p><p> He patted her cheek reassuringly.</p><p> “No, no, little one. Thou hast but a</p><p>scratch or two. Soon Norn will carry thee </p><p>back to the madre who awaits thee. Are </p><p>not the arms of Norn strong arms?” </p><p> His heart sank as his hand came in con-</p><p>tact with her warm, welling blood. </p><p> Though the shadow of death was begin-</p><p>ning to dull her face, she yearned up to Mm, </p><p>whispering: </p><p> “The Beautiful White One was angry</p><p>with Maria—” She moaned a little. Then: </p><p>“Wilt thou not tell me—thou lovest me— </p><p>thou grand man, Norn? Wilt thou not</p><p>kiss me?” </p><p>NORN looked down in the face of </p><p>the dying girl, and read therein </p><p>the age-old yearn of the loving </p><p>woman. He had been blind to the flight </p><p>of time, deeming her a child who would </p><p>never become a woman. Why should he </p><p>not now tell her he loved her, which in </p><p>truth he did, though not in the way her </p><p>woman’s soul desired. </p><p>So he pressed his lips to hers, murmuring </p><p>endearments, saying over and over again— </p><p>“Norn loves thee, Little Brown One.” </p><p> She strained up for a last look at his face,</p><p>and saw his eyes bright with tears. Love </p><p>transfigured her face; he was mourning for </p><p>her. </p><p> Then the shadow crept over her face,</p><p>she breathed a faint “Adios,” her head </p><p>drooped, and she was gone. </p><p> Norn eased back the bruised little body,</p><p>and stood for a time, a motionless, somber, </p><p>lonely figure. </p><p> There was only one thing to do—carry</p><p>that which once had been the Mocking Bird </p><p>back to Twenty-eight Palms. He could </p><p>leave Billy to the coyotes, but not Little </p><p>Brown One. There was no place in that </p><p>canon where the little form would be safe </p><p>from the desert scavengers. </p><p> Tenderly he raised the dead girl to his</p><p>shoulder, and with considerable effort </p><p>picked up his rifle. </p><p> It was a ghastly journey, straining his</p><p>strength to the utmost. He was soon </p><p>forced to cache his rifle and belt. With the </p><p>burden on his shoulder, the cactus and </p><p>boulders, the treacherous rat_Jioles, all </p><p>seemed leagued against him. He </p><p>frequently, talking to the dead girl, assuring </p><p>that which had once smiled shyly at him that </p><p>he would somehow overcome all obstacles. </p><p> When he reached Twenty-eight Palms,</p><p>he was near the limit of his desert-seasoned </p><p>strength. He eased his burden to the </p><p>ground. The last lap of the journey had </p><p>been made without rest, and the engine </p><p>of his being was pounding furiously. </p><p> Exhausted, he sprawled out on his back,</p><p>and lay motionless for a full hour. </p><p> The sunset was now flaming in the pass:</p><p>fiery crimson bars across a sky of smoky </p><p>purple. </p><p> The rancher arose, and prepared a bed</p><p>of palm leaves for the dead girl, and drew </p><p>off his shirt to cover the vacuous face. </p><p> Again he sprawled out. He would sleep</p><p>for a few hours, and then, on the back of </p><p>his faithful pinto, carry Maria home. </p><p> A posse, headed by Uncle Charlie, rode</p><p>up to the Palms shortly before midnight. </p><p>They had combed the Witch-talk side of </p><p>the basin, and had come to Twenty-eight </p><p>Palms, planning to make that point a base </p><p>camp. </p><p> Norn was awakened by the scraping of</p><p>mesquite against boots and stirrups, and </p><p>the voices of the rather incautious man- </p><p>hunters. He was on his feet as they rode </p><p>beneath the palms. </p><p>28 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> There was a pallid half-moon, and Uncle</p><p>Charlie’s searching gaze fell on the form </p><p>resting on the palm-leaf bed. </p><p> “The boy saved lier,” the old man</p><p>shouted jubilantly. “She’s all safe and </p><p>sound. There she is—asleep!” </p><p> “Yes,” said Norn sadly, “she’s asleep—</p><p>forever.” </p><p> The men hurriedly dismounted, and</p><p>gathered closely around Norn. Bitter oaths </p><p>and furious exclamations broke from the </p><p>listeners as he reported the bald facts of the </p><p>affair in the canon. </p><p> “Well,” said Uncle Charlie, as Norn,con-</p><p>cluded, “there’s nothin’ left for us to do but </p><p>take Maria home. Jack, you’d better get </p><p>King’s rifle and belt. We won’t wait </p><p>for you.” </p><p> At dawn the posse rode into Hemper.</p><p>Maria’s father and mother were waiting in </p><p>front of the hotel to receive them. </p><p> As the mother saw the blanket-shrouded</p><p>shape in the arms of one of the horsemen, </p><p>she slumped to the ground, and lifted the </p><p>monrnin|Twflil: fat, pathetically ugly, but, </p><p>PWffHrereSs^ a heart-broken mother. </p><p> The father stolidly received the body of</p><p>his daughter, and carried it into the cabin. </p><p> Dora and Dickie were on the porch,</p><p>sorrowful spectators of the last act of the </p><p>tragedy. </p><p> Uncle Charlie hurriedly gave Dora the</p><p>particulars of Norn’s vain attempt to rescue </p><p>Maria. </p><p> The girl’s eyes filled with tears as the old</p><p>man told of the tortures inflicted on the </p><p>Indian girl and of her final sacrifice. </p><p> As Uncle Charlie concluded the account,</p><p>Norn, who had been assisting Maria’s </p><p>mother back to the cabin, came up. Dora, </p><p>tears gemming her dark lashes, made an </p><p>impulsive move toward him, contrite words </p><p>struggling to her trembling lips. But the </p><p>man merely lifted his hat, flashed her a cold</p><p>disconcerting glance, and passed into the </p><p>office and up to his room. </p><p>CHAPTER VI </p><p>the man was always passing to and fro </p><p>swiftly. She gave him many opportunities </p><p>to approach her, and even resorted to the </p><p>ancient artifice of dropping her hand- </p><p>kerchief, but to no avail. Norn merely </p><p>recovered the handkerchief for her, and </p><p>passed on swiftly. </p><p> She saw him talking with men here and</p><p>there; she saw him emerge from the barber- </p><p>shop, freshly shaven and shorn; she saw </p><p>him laughing at some story a grinning </p><p>desert-rat related; but, never once did he </p><p>turn his eyes toward her. </p><p> Dickie, however, experienced no difficulty</p><p>in halting Norn and worming from him an </p><p>invitation to visit the ranch in the lap of </p><p>Rain-maker. It seemed that any one but </p><p>she could attract and hold his attention. </p><p>Even Brown was able to talk with the </p><p>restless man, and receive an invitation to </p><p>“look over the ranch.” </p><p> She saw Dickie’s face grow cloudy with</p><p>disappointment as Brown hurried into the </p><p>hotel to prepare for the trip. </p><p> Then she heard Norn comforting the</p><p>boy with— </p><p> “You can go with me later—probably</p><p>next week.” </p><p> Despite her blind struggles against it,</p><p>she was conscious of a growing admiration </p><p>for the man’s indifference. She was per- </p><p>fectly aware of the fact that men frequently </p><p>affected indifference to attract feminine </p><p>attention, but this man was not acting. </p><p>She had falsely accused him, and he had </p><p>risked his life in a vain attempt to save the </p><p>Indian girl she had so smugly planned to </p><p>rescue from his clutches. Certainly he </p><p>had a right to be indifferent, to even look </p><p>on her with contempt, to regard her as a </p><p>narrow-minded woman, with no vision, no </p><p>understanding of the good and true, and, </p><p>last of all, to brand her a hopeless egotist. </p><p>Little wonder he ignored her existence. </p><p> “Desert Jack,” Norn’s foreman, drove up.</p><p>Brown came up, wearing a linen duster and</p><p>carrying a small grip. As the men settled </p><p>themselves in 'the mountain wagon, the </p><p>girl felt the prospect of dreary days of self- </p><p>reproach impel her to rush out and force </p><p>Norn to listen to her. But, ere she could </p><p>move, Desert Jack yelled at the dancing </p><p>ponies, and they were on their way, with </p><p>Brown in the back seat, frantically clutching </p><p>at his hat. </p><p> Before they were out of the pass, Brown</p><p>concluded that the driver was a demon </p><p>IN THE days following the funeral </p><p>of Maria, Dora saw Norn fre- </p><p>quently, but she was unable to </p><p>summon sufficient strength to penetrate </p><p>his reserve. Had he given her the oppor- </p><p>tunity demanded by her training and pride, </p><p>she would have humbly asked his forgive- </p><p>ness for her Puritanical outburst. But </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>29 </p><p>who had no regard for human life. Norn </p><p>seemed to take the driving of his foreman </p><p>as a matter unworthy of attention. The </p><p>ponies dashed around the shoulder of Rain- </p><p>maker, the wagon swaying drunkenly on </p><p>the edge of a sheer cliff. The two friends </p><p>in the front seat conversed casually while </p><p>the light wagon skirted the edge of doom. </p><p> “Get into the collar there, you roan</p><p>loafer!” Desert Jack yelled. “What in </p><p>Sam Hill do you think this is—a funeral! </p><p>Move there, you black hawse! What are </p><p>yeh—a tree!” </p><p> And this on the crest of a steep incline,</p><p>down which they raced like an insane </p><p>meteor. </p><p> When they reached the ranch, Brown</p><p>almost fell from the wagon. He was </p><p>deliriously glad to get his feet on good </p><p>firm ground. </p><p> The land-shark could hardly believe his</p><p>eyes when his host ushered him into the </p><p>big living-room of the ranch-house. There </p><p>were big easy chairs, pictures and books, </p><p>piano, and a fireplace built of selected </p><p>boulders. </p><p> Norn called a Chinese servant who served</p><p>the fat man with several drinks of excellent </p><p>whisky. </p><p> And over the dinner Brown could have</p><p>offered up prayerful thanks: salad, fried </p><p>chicken, a gravy par excellence, big, red </p><p>strawberries, and cold, rich cream. </p><p> The dining-room was rich])' furnished.</p><p>There was a touch of the medieval in the </p><p>beamed ceiling, and the heavy, high-backed </p><p>chairs. Norn, with a white-garbed Chinese </p><p>at his back, held the quiet dignity of a </p><p>feudal lord, forced, through a twist of </p><p>circumstance, to entertain some grubbing </p><p>commoner. </p><p> As the meal progressed, Brown’s en-</p><p>thusiasm rose to glorious heights. </p><p> “A miracle,” he declaimed, “a miracle!</p><p>Out of desolation into green fields, great </p><p>trees and all the comforts of civilization.</p><p>And water is the magician that has worked </p><p>this wonder. I shall not rest until I look </p><p>over your ranch.” </p><p> “I’m afraid I’ll have to leave you for a</p><p>day or two,” Norn said, staring up at the </p><p>beamed ceiling meditatively. “I’ve a pros- </p><p>pect over at Poisoned Spring I must check </p><p>up. A couple of men are working on it. </p><p>I’ll return by way of what we call the Ridge </p><p>Trail, and then down the mountain to the </p><p>ranch. I don’t imagine you would care to </p><p>take a night ride. I prefer traveling at </p><p>night to escape the heat.” </p><p> Brown pondered for a few moments.</p><p> “Do you ride all night?” he asked, loath</p><p>to leave the comfortable ranch-house. </p><p> “No, no. I take a pack-horse, and camp</p><p>at midnight.” </p><p> “Well,” and the fat man smiled blandly,</p><p>“what do you say to my daring the wilds </p><p>with you?” </p><p> Norn’s reply was pleasant enough; but</p><p>to Brown, eager to avail himself of the </p><p>opportunity to view the ranch boundaries, </p><p>it seemed tinctured with reluctance. </p><p> “Just as you desire, Mr. Brown, but I was</p><p>a little fearful that you would not care to </p><p>sleep out.” </p><p> Brown expanded his chest, and waved his</p><p>hand carelessly. </p><p> “Life is full of ups and downs, as I was</p><p>telling Miss Wayne the other day. A man </p><p>of my nature is prepared to take things as </p><p>they come.” </p><p> “Splendid philosophy,” Norn com-</p><p>mended. “Did Miss Wayne agree with </p><p>you?” </p><p> “Quite; although she is not a woman to</p><p>talk a great deal. But in the main she </p><p>agrees with me. A remarkable woman— </p><p>a remarkable woman. I’ll warrant you </p><p>that she will be surprised, though, when I </p><p>tell her of my adventures in the wilds.” </p><p> “It must be quite a trial to her,” Norn</p><p>said," “this rough country, and the people</p><p>with whom she has nothing in common.” </p><p>“Yes, it is,” Brown agreed confidentially. </p><p>“Really, I don’t know what she would do </p><p>were it not for me. I’m a life-saver to her, </p><p>Mr. Norn, a mental life-saver.” </p><p> “Very fortunate, indeed,” murmured</p><p>the rancher. Then, abruptly: “Well, if </p><p>you’ve decided to go with me, we’ll start </p><p>shortly. Make yourself comfortable, and </p><p>I’ll have the horses brought up to the </p><p>porch.” </p><p> The rancher followed his guest into the</p><p>living-room. </p><p>BROWN smiled as Norn left him. </p><p>Everything was working out as he </p><p>desired. They would take a little </p><p>canter, go into a comfortable camp, and </p><p>then swing around to the northern bound- </p><p>aries of the ranch. There he would casually </p><p>ask questions concerning those boundaries, </p><p>and ascertain beyond a doubt if the water </p><p>was open to filing. He wandered out 011 </p><p>30 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the porch, noting, with secret satisfaction, </p><p>the great fields of alfalfa. Once in control </p><p>of the water, all this would be his at his </p><p>own figures. </p><p> Norn was giving Desert Jack some</p><p>instructions. </p><p> “I’m taking the white-faced bay, the</p><p>black mare and old Jim. We may swing </p><p>around the mountain and go into Hemper. </p><p>In any event, you take the buckboard into </p><p>town in a couple of days, and wait for me.” </p><p> Desert Jack grunted assent. He had</p><p>been with Norn since the latter was a baby, </p><p>and had long since learned never to ques- </p><p>tion his plans. </p><p> At twilight the horses were brought up.</p><p>Brown insisted on tying his little black </p><p>grip to the saddle. They mounted, and de- </p><p>scended into the desert basin, to ride for </p><p>hours through an interminable gray waste. </p><p> At midnight they halted. Brown heard</p><p>the rancher stamping brush, and then saw </p><p>a tiny flame lick out through the gloom. </p><p> They were in a sandy depression en-</p><p>circled by ifitsquite. At the far edge of </p><p>the depression, was a great clump of water- </p><p>weed, out of which emerged Norn. </p><p> “Too bad,” reported the rancher. “The</p><p>hole’s dry as a bone. Lucky we’ve a big </p><p>canteen of water.” </p><p> He kicked some brush on the fire.</p><p> Brown gave no thought to the dry water-</p><p>hole, being fully occupied with his physical </p><p>discomforts. He was stiff and sore from </p><p>the hard ride, and wanted to lie down. </p><p>Already he was beginning to regret leaving </p><p>the ranch. He secured his precious grip, </p><p>and stood, a big straddle-legged figure, </p><p>helpless and soft as some Brobdingnagian </p><p>baby. </p><p> Nora proceeded to unburden the pack-</p><p>horse. Then he disappeared for a time, </p><p>apparently picketing the horses. Return- </p><p>ing, he tossed the helpless Brown a blanket. </p><p> “Put that under you,” he said tersely,</p><p>“and look out for side-winders.” </p><p> “Side-winders?” echoed the fat man.</p><p> “Yes; rattlesnakes.”</p><p> Brown quivered like a stranded jellyfish.</p><p>What an idiot he had been—what a thrice- </p><p>dashed idiot—to leave the ranch-house. A </p><p>miserable camp, and rattlesnakes. What </p><p>sort of a man was this Norn who could </p><p>lie down so calpily in such a frightful hole? </p><p> The rancher spread his blanket, and lay</p><p>down to sleep. </p><p> Brown spread his blanket out full length</p><p>and seated hmself in the center of it. </p><p>The fire died down, and the gloom closed in </p><p>on the ghastly depression. Vainly the </p><p>snake-shy man attempted to sleep. Dur- </p><p>ing his shuddering watches he often thought </p><p>of starting a fire, but was afraid to leave the </p><p>imagined safety of the blanket. </p><p> Cheerfully Norn greeted the hollow-eyed</p><p>wretch at dawn. Brown’s clothes were </p><p>wrinkled and rumpled with his sleepless </p><p>flounderings. </p><p> “Get a good rest?” asked the rancher,</p><p>stretching his arms and arching his chest. </p><p> Brown stared at him pathetically.</p><p> “It’s all in getting used to it,” Norn called</p><p>back, as he disappeared in the mesquite. </p><p> Presently the rancher sauntered back.</p><p> “Guess we’ll have to do a little walking,”</p><p>he said carelessly. “Horses got away.” </p><p> “What!” Brown almost screamed.</p><p> “Nothing to worry about,” Norn assured</p><p>him. “We’re both strong and healthy. </p><p>We can walk over to my prospect in jig </p><p>time. May have to camp another night, </p><p>though.” </p><p> But I did not anticipate a situation like</p><p>this,” Brown whined. </p><p> “ ‘Life is full of ups and downs,’ as you</p><p>told Miss Wayne,” Norn reminded him.</p><p> The little camp was now flooded with</p><p>sunshine. Brown stood back from the fire, </p><p>while Norn cooked the breakfast. The </p><p>heat gave the fat man a slight nausea. </p><p> They ate in silence. The desert, cruel</p><p>and implacable, had stripped Brown of his </p><p>affability and aplomb. Norn seemed con- </p><p>centrated on some vital inner thought. </p><p> The rancher proceeded to hang the</p><p>saddles up in the mesquite, and to cache </p><p>the camp impedimenta they could not take </p><p>with them. </p><p> “How far will we have to walk?” Brown</p><p>whined, as Norn gave him the canteen to </p><p>carry. </p><p> “Oh, I don’t know the exact distance.</p><p>We ought to reach Poisoned Spring some </p><p>time tonight.” </p><p> The rancher led the way toward the</p><p>barren hills. Brown lurched after him, </p><p>burdened with the little black grip and the </p><p>big canteen. </p><p> The desert now, to the fat man, was a</p><p>cauldron. Norn made no objections to his </p><p>guest’s frequent pulls at the canteen. </p><p>Brown found his weight of soft flesh be- </p><p>coming a burden that bore him remorse- </p><p>lessly earthward. He removed his coat </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>3i </p><p>and collar, and finally his shirt. The sun </p><p>soon blistered his soft, fat neck. Norn </p><p>swung on like a tireless demon. </p><p> “Slow up a bit,” the fat man finally</p><p>gasped. </p><p> “We’ll have to keep moving,” came the</p><p>merciless reply. “We can’t lose time or </p><p>we'll be out another day.” </p><p> Brown was pouring the water down his</p><p>throat when a lean hand took the canteen </p><p>from him. </p><p> “You’re drinking too much for your own</p><p>good,” the rancher reproved. “I’ll carry </p><p>the canteen.” </p><p> Noon, and a pitiless sun that made</p><p>Brown’s fat sizzle. They paused for a </p><p>short rest. Brown clawed frantically for </p><p>the canteen, but Norn restrained him. </p><p> “Too much water is not too good for any</p><p>man,” said the rancher. “Men new to the </p><p>desert are apt to get water-logged.” </p><p> “Please, Mr. Norn,” Brown begged in a</p><p>thin little voice, “one drink. I can scarcely </p><p>breathe.” </p><p> “Help yourself, then, if you feel that</p><p>bad.” </p><p> Norn passed him the canteen.</p><p> No drunkard, with every nerve screaming</p><p>for alcohol, ever pulled a stopper with </p><p>greater haste than Brown unscrewed the </p><p>l op of the canteen. He drank steadily as a </p><p>child nurses a bottle. </p><p> “Has it ever occurred to you that I might</p><p>need a little of that water?” Norn asked, </p><p>though he had not even moistened his lips </p><p>since leaving the camp. </p><p> “Oh, that’s good,” Brown was mumbling</p><p>ecstatically. </p><p> Utterly immersed in self, he did not hear</p><p>Norn’s rather sardonic question. </p><p> The rancher smiled and took the canteen.</p><p>Brown’s eyes followed it lovingly. </p><p> Norn resumed the march. Brown fol-</p><p>lowed because he wanted to keep near the </p><p>canteen. </p><p>E25 THEY failed to reach Norn’s mys- </p><p>terious prospect that night. Norn </p><p>built a fire and fried some bacon. </p><p>Brown lay groaning, oblivious to the </p><p>menace of rattlesnakes for once. He was </p><p>footsore, his lips were swollen and cracked, </p><p>and every nerve quivered with the frightful </p><p>exertion he had made. Norn passed him a </p><p>piece of bread and a rasher of bacon. </p><p> The sun, behind bars of crimson and gold</p><p>and pale lemon, sank into the sea beyond the </p><p>pass where squatted Hemper. Twilight </p><p>settled on Uie ashen desert hills. </p><p> “We’ll go on to the prospect tomorrow,”</p><p>Norn planned, as he ate his bacon and </p><p>bread. “We’ll have to walk back if we </p><p>don’t catch a freight outfit. Of course, </p><p>if you don’t want to go on, you can return </p><p>to my place. It’s only twenty-five or </p><p>thirty miles from here. You should be </p><p>able to make it without water. I have </p><p>walked it several times without food or </p><p>water. By going a little out of your way, </p><p>you could reach Twenty-eight Palms about </p><p>noon; there’s water there.” </p><p> Brown made no reply, convinced now</p><p>that the man was insane. The fool was </p><p>intent on reaching some mysterious point </p><p>in this God-forsaken land, and for no good </p><p>reason. A gold prospect,-1 What did </p><p>the demon want with a gold prospect when </p><p>he already had a million-dollar ranch. To </p><p>follow the insane creature would mean an- </p><p>other day of torture. </p><p> Disconsolate and sodden-faced, Brown</p><p>waited until convinced thj,t__Norn was </p><p>asleep; then his face brightened' with a </p><p>cunning smile, and he surreptitiously se- </p><p>cured the canteen. The gug-gug of the </p><p>water was music to his ears. When he </p><p>could drink no more, he lowered the canteen, </p><p>and looked down spitefully at his calmly </p><p>sleeping host. </p><p> Norn had said that the mountains were</p><p>only twenty-five or thirty miles distant. </p><p>That meant that Twenty-eight Palms lay </p><p>not more than a dozen miles from their </p><p>present camp. He could walk it before </p><p>dawn, rest in the shade of the palms, </p><p>saturate himself with water, and in the </p><p>cool of the night return to Hemper which </p><p>he vaguely imagined lay somewhere be- </p><p>tween the two peaks. </p><p> A deformed moon was coming up over</p><p>the desert’s edge and he could see the loom </p><p>of the peaks. He would waken Norn and </p><p>tell him of his decision. No, not that; </p><p>Norn was bent on retaining the canteen. </p><p>Then, there was the matter of food. What </p><p>arrangements had Norn made for food </p><p>at the mysterious prospect? Doubtless he </p><p>had plenty of food and water there. It </p><p>wouldn’t hurt the rancher to go without </p><p>food and water for a day; he was tough— </p><p>tough as rawhide. He, Brown, needed food </p><p>and water—especially water. He would </p><p>explain to Norn later—when he met him </p><p>in Hemper. It would be all right. </p><p>32 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> The miserable man was so intent on</p><p>escaping from the desert that all his land- </p><p>grabbing dreams had gone glimmering. </p><p>He no longer thought of anything except </p><p>getting the fat body of G. Holden Brown </p><p>where it would be protected from the </p><p>merciless sun and where it could fairly </p><p>wallow in water. </p><p> With infinite caution he secured what was</p><p>left of the bread and bacon, and slung the </p><p>big canteen over his shoulder. Then he </p><p>picked up his grip and tiptoed from the </p><p>camp. </p><p> Norn arose quietly. Glancing at the</p><p>star-strewn sky to get his bearings, he </p><p>struck out in the direction Brown had </p><p>taken. </p><p> Brown stumbled along as best he could.</p><p>At the camp he had soothed himself into </p><p>believing that his appropriation of the food </p><p>and water would meet with a careless smile </p><p>from Norn. Now, that he was actually </p><p>on his way, he realized that he dreaded </p><p>facing the rancher. But he must not think </p><p>of that 210W-; -the all-important thing was to </p><p>readTHemper—alive. </p><p> A point of panic glowed in some dark</p><p>recess of his mind. He thought of the </p><p>North star, and glanced up at the sky; but </p><p>the sky was so thickly sown with stars that </p><p>he could not even distinguish the Big </p><p>Dipper. His had not been a life of star- </p><p>gazing. </p><p> As he gazed at the sky, his lightly-shod</p><p>foot struck a cactus. Agony, intense and </p><p>keen, followed. He hopped about on one </p><p>foot, whimpering and groaning. Then he </p><p>dropped his luggage and plumped down in </p><p>the sand to remove the tiny barbs. They </p><p>came out of the cringing flesh with infinite </p><p>reluctance. He was forced to set his light </p><p>jaws, and jerk quickly. </p><p> When the last little barb had been jerked</p><p>out, he was fairly dripping perspiration. </p><p>For a time he sat motionless, a rumpled </p><p>sweat-soaked manikin on the vast floor of </p><p>the desert. </p><p> He thought of time, and took out his</p><p>watch, and struck a match. </p><p> “Great heavens!” he chokingly exclaimed,</p><p>“it’s past midnight!” </p><p> Past midnight, and no loom of palms to</p><p>mark a safe shelter from the merciless sun </p><p>that would soon rise to torture him. </p><p> He took a long pull at the canteen. He</p><p>shook it, and gasped as he noted how light </p><p>it was. There came no heavy swing of </p><p>water, only a light splash. Even as he </p><p>lowered the canteen, something stirred </p><p>beneath his feet and he leaped back con- </p><p>vulsively, dropping the canteen. His blood </p><p>was chilled by the faint, dry, whirring </p><p>sound. Then he thought of the precious </p><p>water, and fairly blubbered. He lost no </p><p>time in striking a match, for he was fearful </p><p>of picking up the canteen before making </p><p>sure that no gray rattler was within striking </p><p>distance. The black stain of the wasted </p><p>water in the gray sand made him whimper. </p><p>He snatched up the canteen. Miracle of </p><p>miracles, there was a little water left! </p><p> The snake was buzzing in desultory</p><p>fashion. Brown, after securing his grip </p><p>and the bacon and bread, backed slowly </p><p>away from the menacing sound, turned, and, </p><p>with mincing caution, proceeded toward </p><p>Witch-talk. A dark spot or a piece of </p><p>vermiculated cactus stalk filled him with </p><p>sickening dread. His light shoes and thin </p><p>stockings made him feel as though his </p><p>entire body were naked and defenseless. </p><p> Two hours of wandering through the</p><p>gloom and no palms to gladden his aching </p><p>eyes. He became conscious of a terrible </p><p>strain, and suddenly gave way under it. </p><p> “I’m lost,” he whimpered, “lost—lost!”</p><p> Then a comforting thought came to him.</p><p>Men traveled the desert at night. He </p><p>would shout for help. He raised his voice </p><p>in a cracked scream that seemed to profane </p><p>the holy silence. Norn heard that cracked </p><p>scream and smiled cynically. </p><p> Brown listened until he heard the ooni,</p><p>oom, oom of his heart, but there came no </p><p>answering shout. Again he whimpered— </p><p> “Lost, lost, lost!”</p><p> He wanted to drop down in the sand and</p><p>cry, but the fear of snakes kept him erect. </p><p> As he staggered on he thought of Dora</p><p>Wayne. She was doubtless sweetly sleep- </p><p>ing. In the morning she would appear </p><p>on the hotel porch dressed in cool linen. </p><p>She would sit there and calmly watch the </p><p>men of Hemper. What would she say if he </p><p>told her how he had escaped from the </p><p>desert—well, he needed the water more than </p><p>Norn. Norn was a hard man, used to the </p><p>desert. He made some attempt to picture </p><p>her welcoming him with soft sympathy, </p><p>and bringing him water and bathing his </p><p>head, but the picture was vague and un- </p><p>satisfactory. </p><p> Then self-pity came to him. Norn</p><p>hadn’t treated him fairly. The rancher </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>33 </p><p>had dragged him out on an insane search </p><p>for some mythical prospect. It was Norn’s </p><p>fault that the horses had not been securely </p><p>picketed. Everything was Norn’s fault; </p><p>he would tell him so—when he saw him. </p><p> At last, utterly fagged, he resolved to</p><p>dare the snakes and rest. He struck </p><p>several matches, examined the ground </p><p>carefully, and sank down, breathing noisily. </p><p>But he could not rest. He felt that all the </p><p>creeping, crawling things in the world were </p><p>headed toward him. Imagination rose like </p><p>some terrible jinnee. Toward dawn he </p><p>found himself shivering, and began groping </p><p>for twigs with which to start a fire. But </p><p>everything he touched presented im- </p><p>placable stickers and thorns, and he moaned </p><p>and gave up that project. </p><p> THE dawn was beautiful beyond</p><p> compare. In the east bloomed</p><p>\jT banks of tender rose edged with </p><p>pale gold. The air seemed to sparkle </p><p>with life. But the man, lurching to his </p><p>feet, was oblivious to the ineffable glory </p><p>of the dawn. His very soul slavered to </p><p>escape from the Hades into which—and he </p><p>babbled in self-pity—it had been projected </p><p>through no .fault of his own. </p><p> 1’hen over the brow of the range of</p><p>ghastly hills rose the remorseless sun. </p><p> The man was appalled at the scene the</p><p>dawn disclosed. Gray, interminable wastes </p><p>that reached to the ends of the world. Not </p><p>a house nor a human being in sight. His </p><p>sight was not keen enough to note the </p><p>crouching figure in the wash a few rods to </p><p>his left. </p><p> The peaks seemed no nearer than they</p><p>had yesterday. And there were no palms </p><p>waving gleaming green banners of welcome. </p><p> Long before noon Brown had drained the</p><p>canteen, but he still clung to it as a sort of </p><p>mocking emblem of safety. He had eaten </p><p>some of the bread, and with difficulty </p><p>swallowed a piece of the raw bacon. He </p><p>was afraid to stop even to broil a piece of </p><p>the bacon. Under the blazing sun, panic </p><p>drove him forward. He began to make</p><p>concessions. If he reached Hemper he </p><p>would not bother about Norn’s ranch and </p><p>the water. He would leave there. . . . </p><p>But of the girl? He attempted to vision </p><p>her marrying him and going to San Fran- </p><p>cisco with him, but the picture was blurred. </p><p>But he could see himself entering a large, </p><p>cool cafe in that city and having a respectful </p><p>waiter bring him an old-fashioned stein of </p><p>ice-cold beer. He moaned as he thought </p><p>of the ice-cold beer. </p><p> The little grip was now a burden that</p><p>taxed his last shred of strength. He halted </p><p>long enough to hide it securely, as he sup- </p><p>posed, in a clump of greasewood. He made </p><p>no attempt to mark the spot, but childishly </p><p>reasoned that he could later return in a </p><p>comfortable conveyance and secure the grip. </p><p> By noon he was within a few miles of</p><p>Hemper. His stomach was sagging like a </p><p>useless appendage and his tongue filled his </p><p>mouth like a dried sponge. Glittering </p><p>points of light stabbed his eyes, his knees </p><p>trembled, and his hands felt like bloated </p><p>sacks of blood. </p><p> Norn salvaged the little black grip, but</p><p>did not open it. He followed the lurching </p><p>Brown until he saw him disappear in the </p><p>grass and willows that lined an irrigation </p><p>ditch that purled across the road a half- </p><p>mile from the limits of Hemper. The fat </p><p>man was safe now, and would remain for </p><p>some time at the ditch. The raiTchtT-paade </p><p>a little detour to avoid being seen by his </p><p>late guest, and soon was seated on the steps </p><p>of the Hemper House. </p><p> At his request, Uncle Charlie hastened</p><p>to bring him a pitcher of water. </p><p> Between sips, Norn told Uncle Charlie</p><p>of Maria’s warning against Brown and </p><p>Twill, and gave a humorous account of the </p><p>desert trip. </p><p> When he had finished, Uncle Charlie went</p><p>up-stairs and brought down Brown’s bag- </p><p>gage and set it out on the sidewalk. </p><p> “There’s no room in my house for a</p><p>sharper,” the old man declared grimly, </p><p>as he returned to his chair. “Good thing, </p><p>though, your land takes in all the water, </p><p>or the fat hog might ’a’ caused you the</p><p>trouble of killing him, instead of jes’ </p><p>runnin’ his fat off on the desert. Poor fool, </p><p>he went by the old maps, and didn’t know of </p><p>the new survey. What about Twill?” </p><p> “I might speak to him,” Norn said</p><p>softly. </p><p> Just then a curious figure came in view.</p><p>It weaved and wobbled like a scarecrow </p><p>suddenly imbued with life. It gave vent </p><p>to weird sounds, and lovingly patted a big </p><p>canteen it carried. </p><p> It came up on the sidewalk, and, then,</p><p>as it saw Norn, stopped short, and breathed </p><p>noisily through its nose like a frightened </p><p>horse. </p><p>34 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “How are you, Mr. Brown?” Norn</p><p>greeted him kindly. “Quite warm today, </p><p>isn’t it?” </p><p> “Oh, you’re real—you’re real,” screamed</p><p>Brown, staggering toward the rancher. </p><p>“God, I thought—oh, what did I think!” </p><p> He started up the steps but Uncle Charlie</p><p>barred the way. </p><p> “You can’t come in here, Brown,” the</p><p>old man told him harshly. “Set on the </p><p>sidewalk if you want. I’d advise you to </p><p>take the stage out. There’s your baggage </p><p>out there.” </p><p> Brown, dumb and fearful, slowly re-</p><p>treated to the edge of the sidewalk and </p><p>dropped down. </p><p> Abner Twill came down the street and</p><p>noted the curious inert figure seated on </p><p>the walk. When he recognized Brown and </p><p>saw the cold gleam in Norn’s eyes, he </p><p>started to cross the street, but Norn’s com- </p><p>pelling voice halted him. </p><p> “Twill, come here.”</p><p> With the icy fingers of fear clutching his</p><p>heartr’the lawyer approached the rancher. </p><p> “You’re mixed up in some dirty work,”</p><p>Norn accused; and there was an expression </p><p>on his face that hinted of cold steel and </p><p>sudden death. “Take the next stage out.” </p><p>Twill could not quite lose sight of the law, </p><p>and ventured to question— </p><p> “And if I remain, Mr. Norn?”</p><p> “You’ll not remain,” Norn assured him.</p><p>It was all too slow for Uncle Charlie. </p><p>He must needs rush in and secure the old </p><p>Sharpe’s. </p><p> “I’ll take a hand here, myself,” he</p><p>bawled. “Twill, when that stage comes— </p><p>they’re hitchin’ fresh hawses now—and </p><p>you don’t board it, you’re a dead jackleg. </p><p>I’ve always wanted to kill a lawyer.” </p><p> The stage rattled up to the hotel. Uncle</p><p>Charlie crossed his fat legs and rested the</p><p>old buffalo gun across his knee. </p><p> Twill gulped, looked around vainly for</p><p>some avenue of escape, and then said some- </p><p>thing that stirred Brown to groaning </p><p>action.	u</p><p> Some grinning, but mystified Hemperites</p><p>tossed up Brown’s baggage to the driver, </p><p>but when an obliging youth came to the </p><p>little black grip, he gave it too much power. </p><p>The driver failed to catch it, and it dropped </p><p>on the other side of the stage, gapped open </p><p>and disgorged its contents. The west </p><p>wind, sweeping the streets of Hemper, </p><p>picked up sundry maps and legal papers </p><p>referring to the Norn ranch, and blew </p><p>them into weeds, into cottonwood trees, </p><p>and under the sidewalk. The youth tossed </p><p>up the empty grip to the impatient </p><p>driver. </p><p> Brown, escorted by Twill, was too</p><p>exhausted to note the catastrophe that had </p><p>befallen his precious grip. </p><p> The lawyer helped his client into the</p><p>stage and stood for a moment debating the </p><p>feasibility of defying the two grim men on </p><p>the porch. </p><p> “Get in,” came the landlord’s warning</p><p>bellow; and Twill got in. </p><p> “That makes this a pretty decent town</p><p>now,” said Uncle Charlie, with a satisfied </p><p>air as the stage rattled away. “That ends </p><p>the jackleg and that ends Brown.” </p><p> “Yes,” Norn pleasantly agreed, “thanks</p><p>to your persuasive powers, that ends </p><p>Brown. But I’m out a good canteen. He </p><p>took it with him.” </p><p>CHAPTER VH </p><p>SINCE that night Dora Wayne </p><p>had so coldly informed him of her </p><p>utter lack of interest in him or his </p><p>affairs, Chance Hardy’s thoughts had trav- </p><p>eled many dark and devious trails. But he </p><p>invariably returned to the fact of her in- </p><p>difference, not only to him but to all men. </p><p>Rivalry would have stirred him to action, </p><p>but her calm indifference to all had created </p><p>a democracy of unrequited loves. This </p><p>baffled him. There was no man against</p><p>whom he could proceed. </p><p> For a time, especially following the van-</p><p>quishing of Bundy, Hardy had regarded </p><p>Norn suspiciously; but, as the days slipped </p><p>by, and no words passed between the ranch- </p><p>er and the girl, the gambler’s suspicions </p><p>drew back into their subconscious lair. </p><p> With the passing of Maria—the gambler</p><p>had declined to join Uncle Charlie’s posse, </p><p>considering Indians beneath his notice— </p><p>Hardy’s suspicions had peered out only to </p><p>draw back before the fact of Norn’s long </p><p>and friendly interest in the Indian child. </p><p>The rancher had not sought to impress </p><p>Dora Wayne with his prowess as an Indian </p><p>fighter. </p><p> The Brown episode might have caused</p><p>Hardy to believe that Norn had removed </p><p>the fat man because of the latter’s everlast- </p><p>ing dancing of attendance on the girl, had </p><p>not a henchman brought the gambler one </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>35 </p><p>of the papers the little black grip had dis- </p><p>gorged. The paper plainly indicated the </p><p>Brown plot to secure, by a legal twist, the </p><p>water supply of the Norn ranch. </p><p> Hardy marveled at the mercy Norn had</p><p>shown the fat schemer. Brown’s scare- </p><p>crow appearance, following his visit to the </p><p>Norn ranch, and his abrupt departure from </p><p>Hemper under the menace of Uncle Char- </p><p>lie’s Sharpe’s, evidenced a consideration on </p><p>Norn’s part that was beyond the gambler. </p><p>Under like provocation, Hardy would have </p><p>killed Brown with no more regret than old </p><p>Chang accorded the beheading of a chicken. </p><p>As it was, the gambler had been tempted </p><p>several times to run the fat man out of town. </p><p> The gambler looked out moodily through</p><p>the barred window of his saloon. He saw </p><p>Norn on the porch of the hotel. </p><p> A stage barn-helper brought up a big</p><p>cream-colored horse and a black pony. </p><p> Presently Dora and Dickie came out.</p><p>The girl was attired in a riding-habit that </p><p>accentuated the gracious contours and lur- </p><p>ing curves of her perfect body. Her hair </p><p>hung in a thick, dark braid and she wore a </p><p>cavalierish scarlet hat that sported a jew- </p><p>eled buckle. </p><p> Dickie, now beginning to show the bene-</p><p>ficial results of dry, bracing air, ran down </p><p>the steps and eagerly mounted his pony. </p><p> Hardy noted that Norn merely lifted his</p><p>hat to the girl. A black flood of desire welled </p><p>up thickly within ,the gambler as he watched </p><p>her swing up and into the saddle. From </p><p>where he stood he could discern the rose- </p><p>tint in her cheeks, and the flash of her </p><p>white teeth. She was radiant, a flame of </p><p>womanliness that maddened him. He must </p><p>possess her. With face working and fists </p><p>clenched he turned from the window. </p><p>There must be some way to force her to </p><p>come to him. She would never love him, </p><p>of that he was convinced, but he would </p><p>dispense with sentiment if he could only </p><p>possess her. Yet there seemed to be no </p><p>way—she cared for nothing. But, and he </p><p>stopped short, there was the boy; she loved </p><p>him.</p><p> The gambler entered his little sanctum</p><p>and slowly seated himself. A plan was </p><p>beginning to form in his mind—a dark and </p><p>desperate plan. </p><p> Dora and Dickie cantered down the desert</p><p>road. </p><p> As they descended the sharp slope of the</p><p>pass, the cool air of the mountains gave way </p><p>to shimmering heat waves rising from the </p><p>desert basin. </p><p> “We could have postponed our ride until</p><p>sundown,” the girl told her brother who </p><p>was for pressing on into the desert. “We </p><p>had better return now, laddie.” </p><p> As they turned their horses, a lone rider</p><p>emerged from a great wash that lay a few </p><p>rods beyond them. It was Pete, coming in </p><p>to discuss with Hardy certain plans for a </p><p>wider range of activities, and to fix more </p><p>firmly the chieftainship with which Hardy </p><p>had so carelessly invested him. </p><p> Bundy had been content to let Hardy</p><p>plan the campaigns, to simply obey orders; </p><p>but Pete was of a more individualistic </p><p>stripe. A secret ambition for supreme </p><p>command now flowered in his heart. He </p><p>felt he did not need Hardy for a mental </p><p>crutch, and, unlike Bundy, he had no fear </p><p>of the man. But he knew that the Hardy </p><p>influence was far-reaching, and that, until </p><p>more securely entrenched in power and </p><p>prestige, he must walk slowly in the gam- </p><p>bler’s shadow. </p><p> As Pete racked up on his powerful*-</p><p>horse, Dora rode ahead of Dickie to let </p><p>the man pass. Pete rode up even with her, </p><p>and slowed his gait to hers. </p><p> The girl’s face became a mask of haughti-</p><p>ness. The intruder evidently intended to </p><p>preempt Dickie’s place. In a swift side- </p><p>glance she noted the heavy gun swinging on </p><p>the man’s hip. </p><p> “I’m in no rush,” Pete opened, with</p><p>such ingratiating friendliness that the girl </p><p>concluded to endure him. </p><p> Her uncle had told her that Western men</p><p>always spoke to every man, woman and</p><p>child they met on the road. After all, </p><p>there was no good reason why she should </p><p>not be civil to him. </p><p> “We were just taking a little ride,” she</p><p>said politely. “We found the heat oppress- </p><p>ive and turned back.” </p><p> Pete drew a deep breath. He had seen</p><p>Dora on the hotel porch, but there had been </p><p>the width of the street between them. </p><p>Now, close to her, he saw that she was all </p><p>that he ever dreamed a woman could be. </p><p>The superb elegance of her dress and </p><p>equipment, her erect gracious form, her </p><p>violet eyes shaded by the scarlet hat, and </p><p>the thick, gleaming braid that swept the </p><p>cantle of the saddle, all formed a picture </p><p>that filled his hungry eyes—eyes that had </p><p>known only filthy under-sized Mexican </p><p>36 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>women, slattern white bawds of the border, </p><p>and the flimsy girls of the desert towns and </p><p>camps. </p><p> Yet Pete was no fool to blindly throw</p><p>aside caution. Certain primeval desires </p><p>flamed up within him, but he fought them </p><p>back. She was the loveliest woman he had </p><p>ever seen, but a saving streak of common </p><p>sense told him that she was not to be won </p><p>by any of the usual desert methods. Bundy </p><p>had tried one of those usual methods, and </p><p>now Bundy sat in camp croaking like a sick </p><p>crow. Then there were three men to con- </p><p>sider, Hardy, Norn, and Uncle Charlie. </p><p>His desert intuition told him that Hardy </p><p>had a watchful and desirous eye on the </p><p>woman. No woman as lovely as she could </p><p>fail to attract the gambler’s attention. As </p><p>for Norn—well, he had half-killed Bundy </p><p>for simply attempting to kiss the girl. </p><p>Uncle Charlie had many friends, and might </p><p>prove, if given cause, as relentless as a </p><p>wounded bear. </p><p> No, he would present his best side and</p><p>leave a pleasant impression. Later, when </p><p>secure in his” leadership of the gang, he </p><p>would boldly enter the field. </p><p> “Yes, I reckon ’tis hot to folks not used to</p><p>it,” he agreed, widi a bland smile. “But </p><p>it’s cool up here to what it is ten miles down. </p><p>Many’s the time I’ve left town with my </p><p>teeth a-chatterin’ and, inside of two hours’ </p><p>ride, be jes’ hot—yes, ma’am, hot as could </p><p>be.” </p><p>HE EXPATIATED on the climatic </p><p>conditions of the desert, and gave </p><p>her an elaborate description of the </p><p>desolate country that lay back of them. </p><p> Dora smiled at his earnest efforts to make</p><p>conversation. Then she glanced back at </p><p>Dickie and frowned slightly. </p><p> “I’ll ride on,” Pete offered meekly, “If</p><p>I’m botherin’ you.” </p><p> “It doesn’t matter,” she lightly returned,</p><p>“though I fear we are giving my brother </p><p>more dust than is good for him. He is not </p><p>very strong.” </p><p> “Hard lines for a boy to be sick,” com-</p><p>miserated Pete, glancing back at Dickie. </p><p>“All right; I’ll be siftin’ along.” </p><p> Pete’s eyes were now like burning topaz</p><p>shot with jet, and about his mouth was a </p><p>drawn expression that accentuated the pred- </p><p>datory curve of his nostrils. </p><p> She reined in her horse. The desert</p><p>rover strove to bid her an elaborate farewell, </p><p>but the withdrawal of her presence hurt him </p><p>like the pulling of a barbed arrow from his </p><p>chest. He could only turn in his saddle and </p><p>call, in a harsh voice he scarcely recognized </p><p>as his own— </p><p> “Good-by.”</p><p> The girl did not answer. Pete rode into</p><p>Hemper, bowed over his saddle-horn as </p><p>though nursing a wound. </p><p> Dickie rode up to his sister with loud de-</p><p>mands for “spurs and a gun like that cow- </p><p>boy had.” He had been admiring Pete’s </p><p>glittering Mexican spurs and pearl-handled </p><p>gun. </p><p> “You shall have the spurs,” Dora prom-</p><p>ised, “but you are not old enough to have a </p><p>revolver.” </p><p> “Mr. Norn will let me have a revolver</p><p>when I go out to his ranch,” the boy said, a </p><p>little rebelliously. “I bet I could shoot one </p><p>right now. I’m not afraid to shoot one.” </p><p> Dora wished that Dickie had not men-</p><p>tioned Norn. The boy was forever talking </p><p>about the rancher. Always, when she put </p><p>aside thoughts of Norn, came Dickie with </p><p>his chatter of him to intensify her self-re- </p><p>proach for that Puritanical outburst. </p><p> “You seem to think Mr. Norn a wonder-</p><p>ful man, laddie,” she observed, a trace of </p><p>irritation in her tone. </p><p> Dickie’s response was disconcerting.</p><p> “I like him ’cause he doesn’t bother you.”</p><p> “You are not jealous of your sister?”</p><p>This in a low voice, and with a vague reali- </p><p>zation of the truth of the old saw—“Out of</p><p>the mouth of babes—” </p><p> “No-o-o,” the boy hesitated.</p><p> “What then?”</p><p> “Aw, I just don’t like men that bother</p><p>you.” </p><p> “Then you haven’t much cause to worry.”</p><p>Teasingly. </p><p> “You bet I have,” declared Dickie em-</p><p>phatically. “Mr. Brown bothered you, </p><p>didn’t he?” </p><p> The boy grinned like a young satyr.</p><p> The girl flushed. Uncle Charlie had told</p><p>her of Brown’s plot to secure Norn’s heri- </p><p>tage, and of the fat man’s failure to meet the </p><p>desert test. Doubtless, since she had toler- </p><p>ated the smug trickster, Norn now regarded </p><p>her as a feminine counterpart of the Brown </p><p>type. </p><p> Dickie, ever restless, suddenly proposed</p><p>that they dismount and build a camp-fire; </p><p>and to his sister’s astonishment proudly ex- </p><p>hibited three matches he had hoarded </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>37 </p><p>against just such an exigency. To humor </p><p>him and to lighten her mental gloom, the </p><p>girl dismounted and pretended that she was </p><p>a princess a loyal knight had rescued from </p><p>the cruel robbers and taken to his camp in </p><p>the forest. She helped the enthusiastic lad </p><p>build a little camp-fire and played with him, </p><p>breathing a deep prayer of/ thankfulness for </p><p>his returning health and strength. </p><p>PETE turned his horse into the </p><p>stage stable corral, and entered the </p><p>Hardy saloon through the back </p><p>door. Hardy immediately called him into </p><p>a card-room and proceeded to sound him </p><p>for loyalty and willingness to faithfully </p><p>obey orders. </p><p> “I’ve been thinkin’, Pete,” the gambler</p><p>said softly, after satisfying himself of Pete’s </p><p>loyalty, “that you and me should have got </p><p>together long ago. Bundy never had your </p><p>judgment, and I was afraid to give him a </p><p>big job.” </p><p> “Uh huh,” murmured Pete, haunted by a</p><p>memory of violet eyes beneath a scarlet hat. </p><p>“This girl-” </p><p> Pete nearly lost his balance as he straight-</p><p>ened up in his chair. Then caution whis- </p><p>pered to him. </p><p> “What girl?” he queried lazily.</p><p> “Why, the Wayne girl—Uncle Charlie’s</p><p>niece.” </p><p> The gambler looked at his head man in</p><p>frank astonishment. It were as though Pete </p><p>had asked, “What moon?” or “What sun?” </p><p>“Well, what about her?” Indifferently. </p><p>“She’s got a lot of money,” said the gam- </p><p>bler in a low, tense voice, and leaning to- </p><p>ward the sprawling Pete. “A lot of it, </p><p>Pete—thousands and thousands of dollars </p><p>of cold cash.” </p><p> “You don’t expect us to hold her up,</p><p>do you?” drawled Pete, surveying the gam- </p><p>bler indolently through half-closed eyes. </p><p>“Them kind of people don’t carry their </p><p>dinero around with them.” </p><p> Hardy cursed the dullness of the spraw-</p><p>ling, indifferent man. </p><p> “I’m no mind-reader,” Pete grumbled.</p><p>“You have to tell me what you want in </p><p>United States English.” </p><p> “It’s just this,” and Hardy drew closer,</p><p>“she’s all wrapped up in that sickly kid. </p><p>Get the kid and she’ll let go of a load of cold </p><p>money to see him safe.” </p><p> “What next?” Pete asked, eyes on the</p><p>ceiling, thumbs hooked in cartridge-belt. </p><p> “I’ll ’tend to that,” Hardy snapped</p><p>abruptly. “You-all will get a thousand a- </p><p>piece out of it. All you have to do is to </p><p>corral the boy somehow, send me word, and </p><p>I’ll see that you get the money.” </p><p> “But how about Uncle Charlie and his</p><p>friends?” Pete drawled thoughtfully. </p><p> “They’ll think the kid is lost. The girl</p><p>won’t say a word; I’ll see to that.” </p><p> “Then you’ll tell her that we got the</p><p>boy?” </p><p> Hardy nodded.</p><p> “Seems to me,” Pete objected, “that</p><p>would make things sort o’ hot for us after </p><p>we throwed her back the kid. ’Taint likely </p><p>she’d set still. She’d still have plenty of </p><p>money, and a woman never lets up.” </p><p> This was a delicate point, Hardy realized.</p><p>The gang’s sole purpose was to secure </p><p>money; there was no section in its unwritten </p><p>by-laws pertaining to woman or kidnaping. </p><p>But he was offering money—a thousand </p><p>dollars to each member of the gang. That </p><p>should satisfy them and keep them in line. </p><p> Hardy decided to lay his - carrf^'',.-^</p><p>table, faces up. </p><p> “The bunch’ll get a thousand apiece, and</p><p>I’ll sweeten you a little, Pete,” he said flatly. </p><p>“That’s fair enough, isn’t it?” </p><p> “But why bother us with the boy,”</p><p>countered Pete. “Why not grab the girl? </p><p>She-” </p><p> Pete checked himself abrubtly. He did</p><p>not want Hardy to know, for various reasons,</p><p>that he had ever addressed the girl. </p><p> “I come across country,” he went on,</p><p>pretending thoughtfulness, “and I saw some </p><p>woman in the stage road. She had on a red </p><p>hat and rode a light horse. Was that </p><p>her?” </p><p> “Yes, yes,” Hardy assented eagerly.</p><p>“She rides a lot—her and the kid.” </p><p> “Why, then, not grab her, and not fool</p><p>with the kid?” </p><p> “I want her myself,” Hardy burst out</p><p>with an intensity that left no doubt as to </p><p>his desires. “I’ll marry her. She’ll have </p><p>to marry me or lose the kid. After she </p><p>marries me, she can’t say anything.” </p><p> “Was you figgerin’ on us blinkin’ out the</p><p>kid’s lift? if it come to a show-down?” </p><p> “Yes, the gambler snarled, his jaw</p><p>muscles bulging. Then his face cleared, </p><p>and he shook his head. “But it won’t come </p><p>to that. She’ll do anything if she thinks it </p><p>will save the kid.” </p><p> “But I don’t see yet why we shouldn’t</p><p>38 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>grab her,” insisted Pete, seemingly thick- </p><p>headed. </p><p> Hardy scowled. Pete was a good man,</p><p>but there was a streak of mulishness in </p><p>him. </p><p> “Listen here,” the gambler snapped im-</p><p>patiently, “I say I want the woman. I’m </p><p>not sayin’ you and the bunch wouldn’t </p><p>treat her right and throw her over to me, </p><p>but I’m free to tell you, I’m takin’ no </p><p>chances. Money is one thing and woman </p><p>another. I want this one, and I’m ready </p><p>to pay any kind of coin for her—any kind of </p><p>coin, Pete, and don’t you forget it.” </p><p> The gambler’s tone made the nerves</p><p>tinkle in Pete’s gun-arm, but he merely </p><p>stared up at the ceiling, and mumbled a non- </p><p>committal “Uh huh.” So Hardy would </p><p>not trust him with the woman, but, never- </p><p>theless, expected him to do the dirty work? </p><p>Hardy anticipated no trouble after the boy </p><p>was returned to his sister, for the black </p><p>reason that the Hardy brand would then be </p><p>on the girl. Pete debated the feasibility of </p><p>killmj^tlardy then and there. One light- </p><p>ifm^nove and the gambler would be a dead </p><p>man, and dead men have no influence or </p><p>power. What then would hinder him from </p><p>doing as Hardy proposed doing? Why </p><p>should Hardy secure the girl and put him </p><p>off with a thousand dollars? What was a </p><p>thousand dollars compared to such a </p><p>woman? </p><p> Though there was nothing in Pete’s ex-</p><p>pression to excite suspicion, the gambler </p><p>vaguely sensed danger. Automatically he </p><p>moved back a little, and let his hand fall </p><p>carelessly inside his coat. Pete knew that </p><p>Hardy generally carried a short gun in a </p><p>shoulder-holster, and decided to postpone </p><p>the killing until a more opportune time. </p><p> “All right,” Pete agreed, crisply. “We’ll</p><p>grab the boy the first chance we get, and </p><p>send you word.” </p><p> But the outlaw’s mind was busy with</p><p>plans that did not include meekly sub- </p><p>mitting to those outlined by Hardy. Of </p><p>one thing he was sure: he would kill Hardy </p><p>before the gambler placed his brand on the</p><p>girl. He would report the capture of the </p><p>boy, collect the money, and then kill the </p><p>gambler. Then he would force the girl to </p><p>marry him by threatening to do away with </p><p>the boy. </p><p> “Then it’s a go?”</p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> Pete arose with his thumbs inside his</p><p>belt, thus avoiding shaking hands on the </p><p>compact. </p><p> “Have a drink,” Hardy invited.</p><p> “No, thanks. Stomach out of kilter.”</p><p> Hardy looked after Pete somewhat ad-</p><p>miringly, as the latter strode over to the </p><p>window. A little thick-headed, but a </p><p>steady, reliable man who knew enough to </p><p>leave whisky in the barrel. </p><p> The gambler joined Pete at the window.</p><p>What he saw made his black eyes brighten. </p><p> Dickie was being assisted by Norn into</p><p>the latter’s buckboard. </p><p> “There’s our chance,” Pete muttered out</p><p>of the corner of his mouth; and hurried from </p><p>the saloon. </p><p> It was Uncle Charlie who left Norn little</p><p>or no excuse for postponing Dickie’s visit </p><p>to the ranch. </p><p> When Dora and Dickie returned to the</p><p>hotel after their little play by the camp- </p><p>fire, the boy noted Norn’s waiting buck- </p><p>board, and shouted impulsively— </p><p> “Now, Mr. Norn, may I go to your</p><p>ranch?” </p><p> “Take him out, King,” Uncle Charlie</p><p>boomed. “It’ll do him good to get away </p><p>from being babied by these wimmin around </p><p>here.” </p><p> Dora came up on the porch, with Dickie</p><p>clinging to her arm and begging— </p><p> “Let me go, sis, please?”</p><p> She seated herself and drew off her</p><p>gloves. </p><p> “But I’m afraid you will be too much</p><p>bother to Mr. Norn.” </p><p> She flashed Norn a radiant smile, which</p><p>brought no response. Her face clouded. </p><p>Would the man never give her an oppor- </p><p>tunity to tell him of her aching regret for </p><p>those silly, prudish words! </p><p> “I’ll look after you,” Norn told the boy,</p><p>avoiding Dora’s mournful eyes. </p><p> “Very well, laddie,” sighed the girl, giv-</p><p>ing up all hope of coaxing Norn into the </p><p>trap of conversation. “Run up and tell </p><p>Mrs. Milliken to get you ready.” </p><p> Norn found it necessary to arrange some</p><p>things in the back of the buckboard, al- </p><p>though Desert Jack was there to attend to </p><p>such matters. </p><p> As they started, Dickie waved a wild,</p><p>joyous farewell to his sister, and Norjj </p><p>touched his hat, but whether the salute </p><p>was meant for Uncle Charlie or her, the girl </p><p>could not decide. She heard Norn warn </p><p>Jack to drive carefully, and her heart </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>39 </p><p>warmed at the thoughtfulness of the man. </p><p>Dickie was safe in such hands. </p><p> After the buckboard had disappeared</p><p>down the desert road, the girl turned to </p><p>find her uncle studying her. </p><p> “What’s the matter between you and</p><p>King Norn?” the old man asked gently. </p><p>“King hasn’t said a word to you that I </p><p>know of since you come. Somethin’ wrong, </p><p>Dora. He’s the friendliest sort of boy and </p><p>white as they make ’em. What’s wrong? </p><p>I hate to hear that a niece of mine didn’t </p><p>know a white man when she saw one.” </p><p> “Oh, nothing is wrong,” she faintly as-</p><p>sured him. “I presume that Mr. Norn—” </p><p>But she did not finish. Instead she went </p><p>over to her uncle, patted his cheek, and ran </p><p>her fingers through his thick gray shock. </p><p>Then she gathered up her riding-habit, </p><p>whirled, and almost ran up-stairs. </p><p>CHAPTER VIII </p><p>PETE on entering the camp at the </p><p>foot of Witch-talk, immediately </p><p>assembled the gang and told them </p><p>of Hardy’s order for the kidnaping of the </p><p>boy, and dwelt impressively on the gam- </p><p>bler’s promise of a thousand dollars to each </p><p>member of the gang as soon as the seizure of </p><p>the lad was reported to him. Pete stated </p><p>that he did not know whether Hardy would </p><p>draw on his own money or force the girl to </p><p>pay the ransom. </p><p> “But that’s no truck of ours,” he urged, as</p><p>some growls of disapproval greeted his </p><p>announcement. “As long as we get the </p><p>money, we got no cause to ask questions. </p><p>Hardy guarantees the coin and no trouble </p><p>after the boy is throwed loose.” </p><p> Then he quickly launched the plan of</p><p>campaign. </p><p> “The boy’s at Norn’s ranch; saw him go</p><p>out today. My idee is to close in on the </p><p>ranch, and pick up the kid so it will look like </p><p>he’s lost. If he’s on the pony, see that he </p><p>never hits the ground until he’s in rocky </p><p>country. We’ll scatter, and the man that </p><p>grabs the kid is to take him to Coyote Wells.</p><p>I figger that no man could spot a trail over </p><p>that rocky country. Head north of Twenty- </p><p>eight Palms, and keep to the ridges. Who- </p><p>ever gets the kid is to leave a cross of rocks </p><p>at Twenty-eight Palms. Just lay out some </p><p>stones in the shape of across. We’ll be drift- </p><p>in’ back and forwards from Twenty-eight </p><p>Palms to Norn’s place. As fast as you find </p><p>out that the boy is grabbed, go on to Coyote </p><p>Wells. The cross of rocks will tell you </p><p>what’s what. But cover trail—cover trail.” </p><p>“Norn is a bad hombre on a trail,” de- </p><p>mured Jenkins, the hawk-nosed humorist </p><p>who had been so free with gibes for the </p><p>miserable Bundy. He’s a stayer and will </p><p>hang and rattle to a trail. Norn’s no fool, </p><p>either. Besides he has some wolves a- </p><p>workin’ for him. This looks like a man- </p><p>sized job to me.” </p><p> “Suit yourself, Jack,” Pete said indiffer-</p><p>ently. “If you don’t want to set in on this, </p><p>say so, and you’re off the list for the thou- </p><p>sand.” </p><p>“Aw, I’m in on it,” Jenkins hastily as- </p><p>sured him, “but I’m a little leery of Norn.” </p><p>“Well,” sneered Pete, “if your stomach’s </p><p>weak, you’d better see a doctor. This is no </p><p>place for sick men.” </p><p> Jenkins subsided, and under Pete’s quick,</p><p>terse orders they began breaking camp. </p><p> Bundy, though he had made no ob-</p><p>jections, displayed no enthusiasm for the </p><p>work. He dawdled about camp, '&lt;nr,~^£te </p><p>and the other men were ready for the trail </p><p>ere he had saddled his horse. </p><p> “You can watch Big Wash,” Pete told</p><p>Bundy, impatiently. “We’ll go on to </p><p>Norn’s seein’ that you’re goin’ to take all </p><p>day to throw on a saddle.” </p><p> Bundy made no reply, and the gang rode</p><p>forth from the camp to be scattered out, </p><p>under Pete’s direction, in much the same </p><p>fashion that a round-up boss sends forth </p><p>his riders. The general orders were to </p><p>work in close to the ranch during the day, </p><p>and make Twenty-eight Palms a night </p><p>camp. </p><p> Bundy was sore and discouraged. Pete</p><p>had not consulted him, and had given him </p><p>a minor part. The boy would never come</p><p>down Big Wash. </p><p> The mountain stream that watered</p><p>Norn’s ranch disappeared in the sands of </p><p>. Big WTash a short distance from the canon </p><p>that wound back through Norn’s little em- </p><p>pire. Up to where the stream disappeared </p><p>there was a heavy growth of willows along </p><p>the banks of the ever-deepening channel. </p><p>From the willows, the great dry wash, deep </p><p>and wide enough to hide a marching army, </p><p>wound across the desert toward the eastern </p><p>side of the basin. </p><p> Bundy could reach Big Wash in a few</p><p>minutes’ ride. He decided not to exert </p><p>himself. He would obey Pete’s order, but </p><p>40 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>he would make no strenuous effort. Though </p><p>he wanted the thousand dollars, he half- </p><p>hoped that Hardy’s plan would fall through, </p><p>for he now hated the gambler far more than </p><p>he hated Norn. Norn had merely given </p><p>him a beating, but Hardy had, without </p><p>good cause, pulled him down from the </p><p>heights of leadership and made him a </p><p>cipher in the eyes of the gang. He was </p><p>even tempted to slip into Hemper and warn </p><p>the girl, but he could not face the conflict </p><p>with Hardy that such a procedure would in- </p><p>evitably bring. Hardy would surely kill </p><p>him at the first suspicion of treachery. </p><p> Leisurely Bundy rode out to Big Wash,</p><p>and followed it about half-way across the </p><p>basin. Then he dismounted and rested and </p><p>smoked. At nightfall he returned to the </p><p>camp at the foot of Witch-talk. </p><p>DICKIE was delighted beyond </p><p>power of expression at the oppor- </p><p>tunities the ranch offered to a wild, </p><p>free rover. Norn gave the boy a steady old </p><p>safki^*iiorse, .and let him run free over the </p><p>ranch7 warning him against all possible </p><p>dangers. Dickie was just a fair rider, and </p><p>many tilings might happen that would re- </p><p>sult in breaking a leg or an arm. Then </p><p>there were the big mountain rattlers that </p><p>the lad might not see before it was too late. </p><p>But it was impossible for Norn to be with </p><p>Dickie every minute, and impossible to </p><p>keep the youngster close to the house. </p><p>The boy had gained greatly in strength and </p><p>vitality, and was bubbling over with cu- </p><p>riosity regarding the big canon that wound </p><p>up from Norn’s ranch into the mysterious </p><p>fastness of Rain-maker. </p><p> As the days passed Dickie became</p><p>familiar with the canon, and displayed </p><p>such an amount of self-reliance that Norn </p><p>began to feel at ease. When the lad came </p><p>in fairly yelping with excitement, and dis- </p><p>playing the rattlers of a big diamond-back, </p><p>Norn congratulated him heartily on win- </p><p>ning the trophy. </p><p> “I killed him with rocks,” panted Dickie.</p><p>“My pony jumped back when he rattled, </p><p>and I got some rocks and killed the snake. </p><p>Say, Mr. Norn, he was a big one. Long </p><p>after I had killed him he kept moving. I</p><p>had to hold him down with a stick and chop </p><p>his rattles off with another.” </p><p> “You’re getting to be quite a desert-rat,”</p><p>Norn complimented. </p><p> Dickie straightened up manfully. He</p><p>was showing Norn that he was a regular </p><p>man. </p><p> “I guess the boy can take care of himself,”</p><p>Norn told Desert Jack that night. “He’s </p><p>city-raised, but he has plenty of spirit. </p><p>There isn’t a cowardly hair in his head. </p><p>Got a good brain too, and clever beyond his </p><p>years.” </p><p> Dickie found the canon an attractive</p><p>playground, but he often longed to dare the </p><p>mysteries of the desert tliat lay shimmering </p><p>in the sun far below the green fields of the </p><p>ranch. </p><p> One clear afternoon, when there was just</p><p>the faintest hint of Fall in the air, Dickie </p><p>rode up the canon. He was an imagina- </p><p>tive boy, and often amused himself by cre- </p><p>ating little dramas in which he took the </p><p>leading part. This habit had been fos- </p><p>tered by ill health which forbade his taking </p><p>part in the usual games and pastimes of </p><p>strength-blessed youngsters. Also, he had </p><p>read many stories of adventure, and the </p><p>heroic characters of the frontier moved </p><p>through his boyish dreams, invested by a </p><p>precocious imagination with god-like powers. </p><p> When he came to the stream that brawled</p><p>down the canon, he recalled that his favor- </p><p>ite hero invariably threw the redskins off </p><p>the trail by riding down the center of a </p><p>stream. Immediately he preempted the </p><p>hero’s part, listening, smiling contemp- </p><p>tuously, and going through the motions of </p><p>examining a rifle. Then, continuing the </p><p>play, he turned his pony and rode down the </p><p>shallow stream, and, unnoticed, passed </p><p>through Uie wide cordon Pete had thrown </p><p>around the ranch. </p><p> The complaining voice of the stream was</p><p>soon stilled in the sands of Big Wash. The </p><p>lad reined in, wondering what a hero </p><p>should do when his stream disappears. </p><p>Then he discarded the idea of being pur- </p><p>sued by Indians and decided that he was </p><p>an explorer lost in the wilds of Africa. The</p><p>great sunken smooth-floored way, twisting </p><p>and turning mysteriously, invited him on. </p><p> The pony, too, liked the smooth floor of</p><p>the wash, and quickened his pace. The </p><p>boy enjoyed the sense of power and free- </p><p>dom that a good horse gives a rider, and </p><p>let the pony go his way unchecked. It was </p><p>pleasant to rack around abrupt curves, to </p><p>draw in deep breaths of the dry invigorating </p><p>air and to hum vague little songs. </p><p> Then Dickie’s stomach sent him a hunger-</p><p>warning. He visioned the big dining-room </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>41 </p><p>of the ranch-house, and decided that </p><p>a large bowl of bread and milk would be a </p><p>most satisfactory finale to a perfect day. </p><p>With some misgivings, he noted that the </p><p>sun was setting, and decided to get out of </p><p>die wash. He had a vague idea of cutting </p><p>across country to the ranch. But to him </p><p>the sheer banks of the wash offered no </p><p>egress, and he was half-minded to double </p><p>back over his old trail. </p><p>■	Suddenly the wash flared out and merged</p><p>with another great wash beyond which </p><p>a mountain loomed. Dusk was settling </p><p>down and the desert lay shrouded in gray </p><p>gloom before the wondering eyes of the boy. </p><p>Completely turned around, the loom of </p><p>Witch-talk was to him the towering shape </p><p>of Rain-maker. </p><p> Recalling that one of his heroes had</p><p>trusted to the intelligence of his horse to </p><p>take him safely through the trackless wilds, </p><p>he dropped the reins over the saddle-horn </p><p>and let the old desert pony go his way. </p><p>But the horse had no intention of returning </p><p>to the ranch when there was water and green </p><p>grass within a few minutes’ canter. In </p><p>other days he had often visited the sheltered </p><p>nook at the foot of Witch-talk, and was </p><p>now headed straight for that desirable graz- </p><p>ing-ground. </p><p> Dickie saw a little fire winking through</p><p>the trees and imagined that in some miracu- </p><p>lous fashion he had returned to Norn’s </p><p>canon. </p><p> The pony, intent on reaching the water,</p><p>racked up eagerly, and it was with difficulty </p><p>that Dickie reined him in near the fire. </p><p> “What’s wanted?” came a strange voice</p><p>from the darkness. </p><p> Dickie looked about him. This wasn’t</p><p>the ranch. </p><p> “I guess I’m lost,” he answered bravely</p><p>enough. </p><p> Bundy approached the fire, easing down</p><p>the hammer of his rifle. </p><p> Dickie dismounted. Bundy seized the</p><p>lad’s arm and drew him over to the fire. </p><p>The boy looked up and recognized the man </p><p>who had insulted his sister. He jerked </p><p>free, and drew back. </p><p> “You’re a bad man,” he shrilled. “If I</p><p>were big enough, I’d whip you.” </p><p> Bundy laughed softly.</p><p> “You scared my sister,” Dickie accused,</p><p>with a great show of hostility. </p><p> “Now, kid,” Bundy soothed, “you’re jes’</p><p>hungry. I’ll get you something to eat.” </p><p> Dickie made a manly attempt to hold his</p><p>hostile attitude, but weakened before the </p><p>insistent clamors of his stomach, and the </p><p>man’s friendliness. </p><p> Bundy swiftly prepared a meal for the</p><p>boy. </p><p> “There you are,” the man said, when the</p><p>meal was ready. “Throw that into you, </p><p>and you’ll feel better. That’s mountain- </p><p>sheep. It’ll make the hair grow on your </p><p>chest. Dig into it.” </p><p> Dickie seated himself by the fire and fell</p><p>to eating. </p><p> “I know you got reasons for not likin’</p><p>me,” Bundy gently admitted, “but I didn’t </p><p>mean to scare your sister. My horse </p><p>started pitchin’ and I couldn’t hold him. </p><p>I’m sorry about it.” </p><p>AS THE boy ate, he found it in- </p><p>creasingly difficult to regard the </p><p>man as an enemy. Food is the </p><p>open-sesame to a boy’s heart. And then, </p><p>had the man not said he was sorry? A </p><p>gentleman, according to— IWeMe’s code, </p><p>always forgave those who admi7tSa’&gt;4ke-— </p><p>error of their ways. </p><p> When his hunger was appeased, the boy</p><p>decided he would forgive the man. He </p><p>was a little doubtful as to how to proceed, </p><p>but decided that shaking hands would indi- </p><p>cate suspension of hostilities. So he arose </p><p>and approached Bundy who was seated </p><p>Turk-fashion by the fire. </p><p> The boy extended his hand.</p><p> “Your ’pology is accepted,” he said,</p><p>quoting one of his heroes. </p><p> Bundy grinned and shook the lad’s hand</p><p>heartily. </p><p> “You’re a thoroughbred,” he said; and</p><p>he held the boy’s hand a little longer than </p><p>was necessary. </p><p> Bundy felt that his luck had turned.</p><p>The gang was at Twenty-eight Palms, and </p><p>would have to bear the brunt of the battle </p><p>with Norn and Uncle Charlie. The boy </p><p>was in his power, and he proposed to in- </p><p>gratiate himself in the lad’s favor to such </p><p>an extent that the youngster would not </p><p>question his motives. He would take the </p><p>lad to the desert lulls, and follow the rocky </p><p>ridge of the range back into the fastnesses of </p><p>Rain-maker. Norn would, doubtless, strike </p><p>the trail of the boy and follow it to Witch- </p><p>talk. </p><p> Bundy walked over to Dickie’s pony.</p><p>Yes, the horse was shod and would leave an </p><p>42 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>unmistakable trail. But once on the rocky </p><p>ridge of the desert range, even a shod horse </p><p>would leave no trail. Norn would follow </p><p>the trail to the desert hills, but would lose </p><p>it on the ridge. Then there was the possi- </p><p>bility of the rancher clashing with the gang </p><p>before reaching the desert hills. </p><p> Secure in some retreat among the crags of</p><p>Rain-maker, he would fit up a little camp </p><p>for the boy, and prevail on him to re- </p><p>main there. Then he would take the horses </p><p>and slip down to Hemper. There, under </p><p>the cover of darkness, he would contrive to </p><p>get word to the girl that he had rescued her </p><p>brother from the gang, but that the boy had </p><p>been weakened by the harsh experience, and </p><p>was too ill to move. He would tell the girl </p><p>that the lad was constantly calling for her, </p><p>and that he believed the boy would die </p><p>unless she immediately came to his rescue. </p><p> He would demand that she secretly</p><p>accompany him back to the boy. He would </p><p>tell her of Hardy’s part in the affair, con- </p><p>vince her that he had endangered his life </p><p>by coming into town. He would point out </p><p>that fffe only thing for her to do would be </p><p>to safeguard 'the one man who knew of the </p><p>boy’s whereabouts. If she threatened to </p><p>betray him, he would pretend to wash his </p><p>hands of the whole affair. If she asked him </p><p>why he had rescued the boy from the gang, </p><p>he would indicate the fact of the gambler </p><p>having deposed him from leadership as the </p><p>motive for revenge, and, for good measure, </p><p>pretend that he desired to make amends for </p><p>having insulted her. To prove the truth </p><p>of his statements he would show her some </p><p>article belonging to the boy, or he might </p><p>possibly prevail on the lad to write her a </p><p>note. </p><p> Then, when he had the girl in his power,</p><p>he would work south by degrees, and into </p><p>Mexico. Perhaps, after tiring of her, he </p><p>would exact from her a heavy ransom and </p><p>release her. </p><p> He was uncertain as to what he would do</p><p>with the boy. </p><p> Of one thing, however, he was certain.</p><p>His revenge against Hardy would be full </p><p>and complete. Pete, too, would have good</p><p>cause to remember him. He would find a </p><p>way to get a mocking message to the gang. </p><p> “I’ll show ’em all where I head in,” he</p><p>muttered, as he returned to the fire. </p><p> “Feelin’ better, kid?” he asked, smiling</p><p>down at the boy. </p><p> “Yes, sir,” Dickie politely assented.</p><p> “How’d you like to have me take you</p><p>back to Norn’s tonight?” </p><p> “I’d like it,” the boy said cheerfully.</p><p> “Well, then, you jes’ rest till I get my</p><p>hawse ready.” </p><p> Bundy led the way from the camp,</p><p>veering south to strike the desert hills far </p><p>beyond Twenty-eight Palms. It was a </p><p>gray night, but the man knew every trail </p><p>and wash in the basin, and without diffi- </p><p>culty entered the desert hills, leading the </p><p>boy’s horse, since Dickie was beginning to </p><p>show signs of fatigue. </p><p> “I guess we’d better camp,” Bundy told</p><p>the boy, when they came to the head of </p><p>one of the rock-ribbed canons whose tribu- </p><p>taries led up to the barren ridge over which </p><p>he expected to swing north to Rain-maker. </p><p>“There’s water here, and I’m kind o’ lost. </p><p>Besides, you’re tired. Ain’t you tired, </p><p>kid?” </p><p> “Yes,” admitted the boy wearily.</p><p> Bundy helped the lad dismount, and un-</p><p>rolled a blanket he had tied on the back of </p><p>his saddle. </p><p> “Lay down on this,” he said, spreading</p><p>out the blanket. </p><p> “All right,” murmured the stiff and weary</p><p>Dickie, sleepily. </p><p> Bundy wrapped the blanket about the</p><p>boy, tucking it under his feet snugly, and </p><p>insisting that the lad keep his arms under </p><p>cover. When the man had finished tuck- </p><p>ing in the blanket, the boy looked like a </p><p>swathed mummy.	^</p><p> Dickie was soon fast asleep.</p><p> Bundy, though he had no blanket,</p><p>sprawled out on the ground, with a saddle </p><p>for a pillow, and his weapons close at hand. </p><p> Presently he, too, was asleep.</p><p>FOR a long time the big mountain </p><p>rattler watched the huge recumbent </p><p>figure. His snakeship had ventured </p><p>from a snug retreat not far from the </p><p>spring, in quest of rats. He had been </p><p>weaving along, concerned entirely with </p><p>his hunger, when suddenly before him </p><p>a huge mountain stirred. Immediately he </p><p>coiled, and sounded his warning. Then, </p><p>as the mountain failed to make any hostile </p><p>move, the snake relaxed his tense coil, half- </p><p>minded to crawl away. But the mountain </p><p>moved again, and he immediately resumed </p><p>his tense coil, sounding his dry, deadly </p><p>warning. </p><p> Bundy was lying on his back, but some</p><p>The Survivor </p><p>43 </p><p>irregularity in the ground made that posi- </p><p>tion uncomfortable, and gradually the sub- </p><p>conscious mind became aware of that dis- </p><p>comfort, and signaled the body to turn </p><p>over. Bundy turned over, his right arm </p><p>extended. Then he thrust out his hand, to </p><p>rest his arm full length on the ground. </p><p>The rattler saw that hand approach him </p><p>in what he believed to be a menacing fashion, </p><p>and struck out and hooked his fangs in a </p><p>linger. Bundy awoke with heart-shaking </p><p>suddenness, to hear the low whirr of the </p><p>rattler. He sucked in his breath as he </p><p>felt a dart of pain in his finger. He grabbed </p><p>his gun and fired at the dark mound from </p><p>which ensued the dry, deadly buzzing. </p><p> The roar of the gun jerked poor Dickie</p><p>from slumber with a suddenness that nearly </p><p>wrecked his nerves. He fought his way </p><p>out of the blanket, whimpering and half- </p><p>sobbing. The darkness and the strange </p><p>environment into which the bellow of the </p><p>heavy six-shooter had suddenly precipitated </p><p>the boy, made Mm forget for the nonce </p><p>that he was a brave man, and he relapsed </p><p>into whimpering childishness. </p><p> Bundy, disregarding all caution, found</p><p>a match, and in feverish haste started a </p><p>fire. </p><p> “He got me,” sobbed the man. Then,</p><p>in a mad, unreasonable rage, he began </p><p>trampling the snake. Dickie stared at the </p><p>wild spectacle, his little heart pounding </p><p>furiously against his ribs. </p><p> As Bundy trampled the rattler, he cursed</p><p>wildly and hopelessly. There was a wail- </p><p>ing note of doom in his voice that made the </p><p>lad’s skin prickle. </p><p> The fire flamed up, and the man saw the</p><p>boy’s white, drawn face through a red haze </p><p>of rage, and realized he was wasting tune. </p><p>He leaped over the fire, rasping out in a </p><p>choked voice: </p><p> “Come here, boy—quick! A snake bit</p><p>me! You got to help me. Here’s my knife! </p><p>Come now, quick! Hurry, boy, or I’m a </p><p>goner!” </p><p> Slowly Dickie approached the fire and</p><p>started at the man’s hand. </p><p> “Right there on that finger—see—cut it</p><p>lengthways, then across.” </p><p> Shuddering, but filled with sympathy for</p><p>the man, the boy took the knife awkwardly. </p><p>Bundy knelt and laid his hand on his knee. </p><p> “I’m up against it, son,” he told Dickie</p><p>with forced calmness. “You’re the only </p><p>one to help me.” </p><p> The man’s appeal gave the lad a new</p><p>lease on his courage, and he tightened his </p><p>jaws and dropped down on his knees; but, </p><p>when he made the first gash in the finger, </p><p>he cringed and averted his face. </p><p> Bundy patted the boy’s shoulder en-</p><p>couragingly. </p><p> “Brace up, kid. Now slash it across.”</p><p> “Does it hurt?” Dickie quavered, shud-</p><p>dering. </p><p> “-, no!” roared the man. “Cut it—</p><p>quick!” </p><p> Dickie made a supreme effort, steadied</p><p>his hand, and slashed the finger across. </p><p> “Now, son,” explained Bundy, forcing</p><p>himself to speak casually, lest the lad </p><p>succumb to the strain he was putting 011 </p><p>him, “I’ll have to ask you.to suck the blood </p><p>out of that finger. It won’t hurt you be- </p><p>cause your mouth is clean. I can’t do it </p><p>myself, because I smoke so much that my </p><p>mouth is raw. So, if you suck the blood </p><p>out, you will take the snake poison with it, </p><p>and save my life. If you don’t I’ll die here </p><p>pretty quick. Do you want me to die?” </p><p> “No,” gulped Dickie, his eyes wide with</p><p>the dread of death. </p><p> It was the supreme test of the boy’s</p><p>courage and will power. The sight of the </p><p>blood nauseated him, and his senses reeled </p><p>as he thought of putting the finger in his </p><p>mouth, but he seized Bundy’s hand and </p><p>faithfully obeyed the low-toned directions </p><p>of the man. </p><p> “There, that's good," Bundy said, grate-</p><p>fully. “Thank you.” </p><p> “You’re welcome,” returned Dickie, his</p><p>nostrils flaring and striving to wipe the </p><p>taste of the blood from his tongue with the </p><p>back of his hand. </p><p> Bundy drew a silk handkerchief from his</p><p>shirt, pocket, and tied it around his fore- </p><p>arm. He broke off a piece of greasewood, </p><p>and twisted the handkerchief with all his </p><p>strength. Then he pressed his arm against </p><p>his side to hold the tourniquet in position. </p><p> But the rattler that had bitten Bundy</p><p>was old, and the venom he had injected </p><p>into the veins of the man was like liquid </p><p>fire. </p><p> Bundy realized that he must get to a</p><p>doctor or perish. Like most desert-rals </p><p>he had a contempt for rattlesnakes, and </p><p>had never bothered about carrying an anti- </p><p>dote for snake-bite. </p><p> There was only one thing to do, take the</p><p>boy and ride to Hemper. There he would </p><p>44 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>turn the lad over to his uncle, and tell him </p><p>that?he had rescued him from the gang. </p><p>That would of course require the connivance </p><p>of the lad, which meant making a clean </p><p>breast of the whole affair to him, and trust- </p><p>ing to his boyish sympathy. </p><p> “Listen, son,” he began hurriedly. “We</p><p>got to get out of here, and hit the trail for </p><p>Hemper. Now I want you to play square </p><p>wi th me. I want you to lie for me. ” </p><p> The boy regarded him with round</p><p>wondering eyes. </p><p>“It is wrong to lie,” he stated emphati- </p><p>cally. “My sister says it is wrong to lie.” </p><p>The man bowed his head slightly, as </p><p>though in mute obeisance to the clean, </p><p>little soul confronting him. </p><p> “Yes, I know, son,” he admitted gently,</p><p>"it is wrong to lie, but this is a case where a </p><p>lie will save my life. You see, boy, I didn’t </p><p>take you home as I said I would. That </p><p>will make men in Hemper want to kill me </p><p>or put me in jail. But, if you say I took </p><p>you from some other men and started home </p><p>with you, that will save my life. I got to </p><p>toTlemper so a doctor can cure my snake- </p><p>bite.” </p><p> “I’ll lie for you to save your life,” Dickie</p><p>promised solemnly. </p><p> “But will you do as I say? Will you</p><p>tell everybody like this, ‘He took me from </p><p>some men and brought me home?’ Say it.” </p><p>“Yes, sir,” the boy agreed; and slowly </p><p>repeated— </p><p> “‘He took me from some men and brought</p><p>me home.’ ” </p><p> “Shake on it?”</p><p> For answer the lad laid his hand in the</p><p>man’s huge paw. </p><p>CHAPTER IX </p><p> HE WAS known as the Apache</p><p>Kid, though he had no Indian blood </p><p>in his veins. A childless squaw had </p><p>found him cooing and gurgling in a “grub”</p><p>box, following a massacre of some foolhardy </p><p>Argonauts. She had taken the baby to </p><p>her heart, and, in the years that followed, </p><p>he not only became versed in Indian cun- </p><p>ning, but acquired a snake-like quickness </p><p>with the white man’s weapon, the six- </p><p>shooter. Ere he had the suspicion of a </p><p>hair on his face he had killed his first </p><p>man. </p><p> Killing followed killing until even the</p><p>most hardened desperadoes of the then </p><p> lawless Southwest came to regard the</p><p> Apache Kid as the apogee of deadliness.</p><p> Many gun-twirlers secretly longed to kill</p><p> him, not through any desire to benefit the</p><p> general public, but to acquire at one shot</p><p> the Kid’s red fame. Now and then the</p><p> Mexican border was reminded of the fact</p><p> that he who let such ambitions goad him</p><p> into action, invariably departed this life</p><p> ere a watch could tick a second.</p><p> Now, to the Apache Kid, in the fulness</p><p> of his power, and playing a lone hand in</p><p> the game of outlawry along the Mexican</p><p> border, came luring accounts of a woman</p><p> of wondrous beauty in a town a week’s ride</p><p> to the north.</p><p> At first the Kid had been indifferent,</p><p> deeming the report in line with those of</p><p> fabulous mountains of gold in desert infer-</p><p> nos; but men continued to talk of “the</p><p> girl at Hemper,” and gradually his interest</p><p> was aroused. Money he could secure by</p><p> playing cards with men who were afraid to</p><p> win from him, and killing had become more</p><p> or less a routine. There remained only</p><p> woman; and he was twenty-two.</p><p> Stage-drivers, off duty, are generally a</p><p> garrulous set, and the Kid found one who</p><p> had seen the girl at Hemper.</p><p> The driver was pleased to enlighten the</p><p> youth, since he knew that young man’s</p><p> uncertain temper, and was aware the Kid</p><p> had killed men for no known reason except</p><p> “to see ’em kick.”</p><p> “There’s nothing like her in this coun-</p><p> try,” the driver declared fervently. “She’s</p><p> sure somethin’ you can rest your eyes on,</p><p> * Kid. I’ve seen pretty wimmin in my time,</p><p> but she takes all bets. I saw her once in</p><p> front of the hotel her uncle runs, and I says</p><p> then, says I, ‘There goes the finest-lookin’</p><p> girl in Gawd-a’mighty’s world.’ Black</p><p> hair, Kid, with a glisten to it, and a fig-</p><p> ger-”</p><p> The driver paused, unable to find words</p><p> to express his rapturous thoughts.</p><p> “But,” he went on finally, “it wasn’t so</p><p> much her fine looks as it was the way of her.</p><p> Old as I be, with my hair wore down to the</p><p> rind, that gal’s way called to me like a chunk</p><p> of gold in the sun. If I was a young man,</p><p> I’d try to win her; and, if I died a-tryin’, I</p><p> wouldn’t care. She is sure the kind that</p><p> calls to a man, and I reckon there’s many</p><p> a man lookin’ her way. But she’s cold—</p><p> cold as a diamond. Rich, too, and no scrub</p><p> can get within speakin’ distance of her.”</p><p>The Survivor </p><p>45 </p><p> “What’s she doin’ out here?” the Kid</p><p>asked softly. </p><p> “Sick brother—con-sumpted, I guess, or</p><p>leanin’ towardit. Brought him out to get him </p><p>cured up; jes’ a boy. Well, I must begoin’.” </p><p> The Kid leaned against an adobe build-</p><p>ing and considered the information given </p><p>him by the driver. He admitted no inter- </p><p>est, yet he was aware of a strange restless- </p><p>ness. That night he drifted north thirty </p><p>miles, and the next day killed a Mexican </p><p>in a monte-game dispute. The Kid was </p><p>naturally irritable, and the strange rest- </p><p>lessness had not tended to blunt the deadly </p><p>fangs of his temper. </p><p> Again he mounted and drifted north</p><p>some forty or fifty miles. In a little stage </p><p>station on a bleak mesa, he met, face to </p><p>face, the brother of a man he had killed </p><p>in Arizona. The Kid frowned darkly, and </p><p>the brother of the victim of the killer’s </p><p>lightning lead passed on to strengthen his </p><p>nerves with strong waters. </p><p> Always did he have to kill men, thought</p><p>the Kid peevishly. In time this brother </p><p>of the man who had bowed to his lead </p><p>would come, seeking satisfaction. </p><p> The Kid did not have long to wait. The</p><p>man, maddened with vile whisky, charged </p><p>from a doonvay, firing as he advanced. </p><p>The Kid’s right gun barked briefly, and the </p><p>man slumped to the ground. </p><p> That night the Kid rode forty miles, and</p><p>a few days later sauntered into Chance </p><p>Hardy’s saloon, his fame preceding him. </p><p> Hardy accorded the youth with the rat-</p><p>tlesnake jaw and restless, bloodshot eyes </p><p>the utmost deference. The gambler’s atti- </p><p>tude deeply impressed certain officers of </p><p>the law who looked to him for guidance in </p><p>all matters. Then the Kid’s appearance </p><p>did not belie his fame. He looked “bad,” </p><p>and his glance was like a knife-thrust. </p><p> Hardy extended to the Kid the hospi-</p><p>tality of his place. The youth, oddly </p><p>enough, did not drink, but he was an invet- </p><p>erate gambler. Hardy steered him to the</p><p>faro layout, signaling to the pasty-faced </p><p>dealer to permit the visitor to win a rea- </p><p>sonable amount. </p><p> The Kid was a nervous player, and de-</p><p>manded plenty of elbow-room. His deadly </p><p>darting glances soon cleared a space around </p><p>him; and, as he began to win, he smiled his </p><p>curious, mirthless smile. </p><p> Suddenly he decided he had won enough,</p><p>and cashed in. The eyes of every man in </p><p>the saloon followed him as he sauntered to </p><p>the door. He whirled on them with start- </p><p>ling suddenness and, as one man, the watch- </p><p>ers flinched. He smiled comprehension of </p><p>their fears, and edged through the doorway. </p><p> “You’ll have to let me go if the Kid</p><p>comes back,” the faro-dealer whined to </p><p>Hardy. “I’d as soon deal to a rattler.” </p><p> Uncle Charlie, in his chair on the hotel</p><p>porch, saw the Kid approaching, and turned </p><p>to Dora with more excitement than she had </p><p>ever seen him display. </p><p> “Get up-stairs—quick, girl!” he puffed in</p><p>heavy whispers. </p><p> “What is the matter with you, uncle?”</p><p>she exclaimed, unable to see any cause for </p><p>his intense excitement. </p><p> Then, before Uncle Charlie could answer,</p><p>the Kid’s spurs jingled on the steps, and the </p><p>old man gripped the arms of his chair and </p><p>stared fixedly at the intruder. </p><p> The girl saw an under-sized youth in his</p><p>early twenties, bow-legged and slope-shoul- </p><p>dered from years of riding. He was armed </p><p>with two heavy, pearl-handled revolvers, </p><p>but that struck her as nothing omw^aL </p><p>Since her arrival in Hemper she had seen' </p><p>many armed men. Her feminine mind, </p><p>unschooled in the signs of deadliness, failed </p><p>to note the murderous cruelty deep-etched </p><p>in the face of the Apache Kid. To her he </p><p>was merely some cowboy come 'to speak a </p><p>few words to her uncle. </p><p> She suddenly became aware of a deathly</p><p>stilness broken only by the jingle of the </p><p>stranger’s spurs as he deliberately ap- </p><p>proached her. She could see men across </p><p>the street, and there was an odd intentness</p><p>in their attitudes. She saw Hardy back of </p><p>the breast-high swinging doors of his sa- </p><p>loon; and he, too, was intently watching </p><p>the youth who, to her annoyance, had halted </p><p>close to her, and was staring down at her. </p><p> The Kid, having done as he pleased since</p><p>boyhood, saw no reason why he should not </p><p>tell this woman of rare beauty the purpose </p><p>of his visit to Hemper. </p><p> “I come three hundred miles to see you,”</p><p>he told her, in a low expressionless voice, </p><p>“and I don’t think I’m goin’ to leave this </p><p>town loser.” </p><p>UNCLE CHARLIE moved slightly, </p><p>praying for the old Sharpe’s and a </p><p>dead rest. The Kid flashed him a </p><p>glance of deadly warning. The old man’s </p><p>face turned a ghastly purple, and in his </p><p>46 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>eyes came a look of dumb pathos. Old, </p><p>slow and fat, he realized he was as helpless </p><p>as an ox before this deadly youth whose </p><p>smooth-hammered, triggerless guns hung </p><p>within easy reach of his supple hands. It </p><p>was not fear that held the landlord motion- </p><p>less in his chair, but his knowledge of the </p><p>mental processes of killers, and the realiza- </p><p>tion of his own helplessness. He knew that </p><p>such as the Apache Kid struck swiftly at </p><p>the slightest unusual move, and he felt that </p><p>it would be sheer folly to throw his life away </p><p>unless the Kid went beyond mere words. </p><p> For several moments the killer appraised</p><p>the beauty of the girl; and then, in that </p><p>same expressionless voice— </p><p> “I reckon I’m goin’ to like you.”</p><p> This was too much, even from a cowboy</p><p>who might be a friend of her uncle. She </p><p>arose, and being taller than the Kid, looked </p><p>down at him haughtily; and then turned to </p><p>her uncle. </p><p> “Uncle,” she said in her coolest and most</p><p>impersonal tone, “this man is annoying me. </p><p>Will you please order him away.” </p><p>J&amp;tSTK.id lifted his upper lip in a wolf-like </p><p>grin. It touched his vein of evil humor to </p><p>imagine a fat, old man ordering him to do </p><p>anything. He was half-tempted to .kill </p><p>the old man just to impress the girl. Uncle </p><p>Charlie read that murderous thought in the </p><p>dark face and twitching hands, and held </p><p>himself motionless and mute. </p><p> Her uncle’s failure to protect her hurt the</p><p>girl, as well as sorely puzzled her. She </p><p>would go to her room. She turned to enter </p><p>the office, but the Kid blocked the way. </p><p> “Let me pass,” she commanded, as though</p><p>addressing some insolent servant. </p><p> This amused the Kid. She was a thor-</p><p>oughbred, and he would find much pleasure </p><p>in taming her. Apparently she was una- </p><p>ware of the identity of the man she was </p><p>addressing; therefore, to a certain extent, </p><p>he would enlighten her. </p><p> “That old man over there,” he said</p><p>softly, darting an ophidian glance at Uncle </p><p>Charlie. “Do you want to see that old man </p><p>die?” </p><p> The girl grew sick with horror as she</p><p>slowly comprehended the threat of ruth- </p><p>less murder his question carried. For the </p><p>first time she glimpsed his perverted soul </p><p>mocking her through dark, bloodshot eyes. </p><p> “Sit down, then,” the Kid suggested, as</p><p>an alternative likely to delay the demise of </p><p>the fat old man. </p><p> She backed toward a chair and seated</p><p>herself. The Kid came close to her, and </p><p>one slim hand crept out and smoothed her </p><p>hair. She shuddered at his touch, her eyes </p><p>on his pearl-handled guns. </p><p> The Kid’s hand strayed down her shoul-</p><p>der and arm, and closed about her wrist. </p><p>He lifted her hand and examined the white, </p><p>smooth fingers curiously; then his gaze </p><p>focused on a ring she wore, a filigreed gold </p><p>circlet set with a cluster of diamonds and </p><p>rubies. In a childish mood he removed the </p><p>ring and placed it on one of his own slim </p><p>fingers. </p><p> “You must have plenty of dinero,” he</p><p>remarked, his mood now that of a simple </p><p>savage playing with a gaud. “How much </p><p>it cost?” </p><p> Dora was now fully aware that the man</p><p>before her was more dangerous than a rat- </p><p>tlesnake. Any moment the murderous </p><p>mood might return; she must humor him. </p><p>It was not a nightmare, but stark reality. </p><p>A deadly stranger had threatened her un- </p><p>cle’s life, and removed a ring from her finger. </p><p>Her uncle had drifted away from her, and </p><p>was now vague and remote. There were </p><p>other men within call, but they seemed </p><p>frozen, incapable of movement. She was </p><p>alone—and helpless. </p><p> Never before had she faced the terrible</p><p>fact of woman’s helplessness. She was </p><p>no stronger than Maria had been when the </p><p>Paiute had roused her and drove her to her </p><p>death. There had been a time, ages ago, </p><p>when her woman’s helplessness seemed a </p><p>charming attribute. In that other world, </p><p>where money ruled and police watched </p><p>every corner, women prided themselves on </p><p>their helplessness. In this world, where</p><p>nothing counted save the ability to kill </p><p>swiftly, there was no romance in helpless- </p><p>ness, no charm in weakness. Here, despite </p><p>her wealth, her refinement and culture, her </p><p>mind infinitely superior to that of the crea- </p><p>ture before her, she was just a helpless </p><p>woman. </p><p> And there was no man to whom she could</p><p>turn for protection. Then suddenly a figure </p><p>took form in the mirror of her mind, a sure, </p><p>reliable, dominant being who was all that </p><p>she was not. To that figure her thoughts </p><p>turned with joyful relief. It came to her </p><p>from some mystic source that that figure </p><p>would stand between her and all danger. </p><p>Yet she could not bring herself to name the </p><p>figure. Pride held her back. She who had </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>47 </p><p>always been heart-free could not imme- </p><p>diately bow to love; she who had remained </p><p>quiescent, amused at the struttings of male </p><p>egotists, indifferent to their love agonies, </p><p>could not in one quick breath admit that </p><p>danger had stirred love to call up the vision </p><p>of the sure, reliable, dominant one. </p><p> “How much it cost?” impatiently re-</p><p>peated the Kid. </p><p> “Seven hundred dollars,” she answered</p><p>faintly. </p><p> The Kid examined the ring with renewed</p><p>interest. </p><p> “A bunch of yearlin’s in that,” he mut-</p><p>tered, marveling that so tiny a thing could </p><p>be so valuable. </p><p> “How many hawses would it bring?” he</p><p>queried, turning the ring on his finger. </p><p> “I can not tell you unless you tell me</p><p>what horses cost,” she replied, praying that </p><p>he would take the ring and go. </p><p> “Say at fifty dollars a head.”</p><p> “It would then bring fourteen horses,”</p><p>she calculated mechanically. </p><p> The Kid counted his fingers Indian-</p><p>fashion. </p><p> “I’ll keep it,” he announced coolly.</p><p> Then the murderous mood returned, and</p><p>he gave Uncle Charlie a malignant glance. </p><p> Placing a hand under the girl’s chin, he</p><p>tilted up her face, and, in a monotone as </p><p>dry and deadly as the whirr of a rattler, he </p><p>voiced his evil plan. </p><p> “Tomorrow you go south with me. I’ll</p><p>treat you right if you don’t hang back. I </p><p>come a long trail for you and I’m not goin’ </p><p>back alone.” </p><p> He stepped back and stared at her with</p><p>a concentrated deadliness that gave her </p><p>the sensation of sinking, sinking, sinking. </p><p>Though her lips were mute, her soul, frantic</p><p>and utterly desperate, called— </p><p> “Norn, Norn, save mel”</p><p> It was done. Her soul had named the</p><p>dominant figure of her visioning. Come </p><p>sorrow, come agony, come death, she loved </p><p>King Norn. Love and Hope came and </p><p>drove back the shadows; Norn would pro- </p><p>tect her. In time he would forgive her, </p><p>forget that prudish outburst, and stand be- </p><p>tween her and all danger. She smiled wanly, </p><p>touched by the mystery of love. </p><p> She was mocking him, thought the Kid,</p><p>noting her smile. She thought he had been </p><p>speaking vain, empty words. Again he </p><p>seriously considered killing the fat old man </p><p>just to impress her. His gaze fastened on </p><p>the heavy, inert figure in the big chair. He </p><p>half-drew his right gun, and, in a vicious </p><p>aside, snarled at the girl: </p><p> “You ain’t said you’d go with me yet.</p><p>Do I have to kill that old man now?” </p><p> “I’ll go with you,” she cried weakly, fully</p><p>expecting to see her uncle shot. </p><p> The Kid lifted his upper lip in the wolf-</p><p>like grin, and edged oft the porch, satisfied </p><p>that she was thoroughly intimidated, and </p><p>that on the morrow she would, to save her </p><p>uncle’s life, ride south with him. </p><p> As tiie Apache Kid swung across the street,</p><p>with his lurching, awkward rider’s stride, the </p><p>watchers drew back lest they attract his </p><p>hostile attention. Hardy entered his little </p><p>sanctum shaking with jealous rage against </p><p>the Kid; but, when the killer entered the </p><p>saloon, he found the gambler seemingly en- </p><p>grossed in business. </p><p> The moment the Kid passed through the</p><p>swinging doors of the saloon, Uncle Charlie </p><p>almost hurled himself from his chair, and </p><p>dragged the girl into the office. </p><p> “Get up-stairs,” he panted^and lock</p><p>yourself in. Here, wait, and take niy-sijfc </p><p>shooter!” </p><p> Hurriedly he secured the heavy revolver</p><p>and thrust it in her trembling hand, and </p><p>pushed her toward the stairway. </p><p> “That was the Apache Kid!” he yelled,</p><p>as he seized his old Sharpe’s. “A killer </p><p>who’sas bad as a blind snake. He’ll do as he </p><p>says. Get to your room, girl, and stay therel” </p><p> Dumbly she obeyed him.</p><p> Uncle Charlie locked and barred the front</p><p>door of the hotel. Then he waddled back </p><p>and ordered Chang to hold the kitchen at </p><p>all costs. From the kitchen he plunged </p><p>into the alley back of the hotel and made </p><p>his way, puffing and panting, to Meeker’s </p><p>store. </p><p> “We got to get some men together,” he</p><p>shouted at the storekeeper. “The Apache </p><p>Kid’s after my niece—swears he’ll take her </p><p>south with him.” </p><p> “But he’s a dangerous man,” demurred</p><p>Meeker. </p><p> “But you went out with me after Billy</p><p>Snake,” roared Uncle Charlie. </p><p> “Yes, I know; but that was just an In-</p><p>dian,” Meeker side-stepped. </p><p> In a bull-like rage, Uncle Charlie stormed</p><p>from the store, calling the storekeeper a </p><p>“yellow dog” and a “prune-countin’ skunk.” </p><p> Bill Watson, the blacksmith, felt that .the</p><p>Apache Kid was out of his class. </p><p>48 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “They say he’s killed over twenty men,”</p><p>rumbled the blacksmith mournfully. “I’d </p><p>jes’ try to get him when he wasn’t lookin’, </p><p>if I was you.” </p><p> But the big iron-thumper carefully</p><p>avoided volunteering to assist in ridding </p><p>Hemper of the killer. </p><p> From man to man waddled Uncle Char-</p><p>lie, wheedling one, cursing another, but to </p><p>no avail. He had supposed that the busi- </p><p>ness men of the little town would turn out </p><p>en masse, but he was wofully disappointed. </p><p>Most of them that he approached had been </p><p>chilled by Dora’s indifference to their self- </p><p>imagined charms, and felt no call to protect </p><p>the girl. She was “stuck-up”; let her look </p><p>after herself. </p><p> The landlord believed that an appeal to</p><p>the lawless element controlled by Hardy </p><p>would be a waste of breath. Dora had not </p><p>told him of Hardy’s proposal of marriage, </p><p>and so he counted the gambler a friend </p><p>and backer of the Kid. </p><p> So he went his weary, hopeless way,</p><p>attempti^io drum up a vigilance commit- </p><p>i&amp;Tamong the so-called respectables. But </p><p>respectability, even in a lawless desert town, </p><p>has a habit of carefully guarding its own </p><p>precious hide. Respectability never won </p><p>any wars or freed any slaves. The fighting </p><p>is generally done by the men whom the re- </p><p>spectables warn their wives against. </p><p> True, respectability had been represented</p><p>in the posse that had taken the trail of the </p><p>Indian, but, when Uncle Charlie went over </p><p>the list, he found the lawless ones, the men </p><p>without property, the partisans of Hardy, </p><p>had formed the majority of that posse. </p><p> The old man returned to the hotel,</p><p>crushed and beaten. But the feel of the </p><p>old Sharpe’s heartened him. He would </p><p>fortify himself in the office, and defend his </p><p>citadel to the best of his ability. </p><p>AS HE entered the saloon, the Kid </p><p>signaled to Hardy that he desired </p><p>speech with him. The gambler gave </p><p>a sawed-off shotgun, reposing in the corner </p><p>of his sanctum, a fleeting glance; but having</p><p>no desire to die quickly, set his face in the </p><p>gambler’s mask, and obeyed the summons. </p><p> “I aim to tame that filly over there,” the</p><p>Kid announced, jerking his head in the </p><p>direction of the hotel, “and I don’t look for </p><p>no one to set in on my game.” </p><p> Back to wall, hands twitching close to</p><p>low-hung guns, a restless, ursine swing to his </p><p> head, the Kid was not a being to “my dear-</p><p>fellow” into changing his mind, or to salve </p><p>with flattery, or to reprove in the ringing </p><p>tones of the stage hero. </p><p> Words, to the Apache Kid, were unim-</p><p>portant save when they heralded gun-talk. </p><p>He had made his announcement not out of </p><p>bravado, but to ascertain if there was a </p><p>possibility of Hardy disapproving of his </p><p>plan. If he caught the faintest hint of dis- </p><p>approval on the gambler’s part, he would </p><p>kill him, seize the girl and start for the bor- </p><p>der immediately. </p><p> The Kid was a first-class killer, but a</p><p>poor poker-player. Hardy read his face as </p><p>easily as he would the reflection of a card </p><p>in a mirror. The gambler realized that he </p><p>must say the right words in exactly the </p><p>right way, or be shot down. Further, the </p><p>gambler knew the psychology of fear. He </p><p>knew that it was entirely possible for a man </p><p>of the Kid’s reputation to intimidate a whole </p><p>town. To successfully attack this master </p><p>gun-twirler, there would have to be a </p><p>leader, ready and willing to die. Such a </p><p>leader was not to be secured in Hemper, </p><p>and the gun-fighters that might be bribed </p><p>into daring the Kid’s lead were in the des- </p><p>ert, watching for an opportunity to seize </p><p>the girl’s brother. </p><p> The gambler’s answer was toneless and</p><p>impersonal. </p><p> “A man’s woman is his own business,” he</p><p>said, flicking the ash from his cigar. </p><p> The Kid’s searching gaze played recur-</p><p>rently across Hardy’s mask-like face like </p><p>flashes of sheet-lightning. </p><p> “A good way to look at it,” darkly com-</p><p>mented the killer. </p><p> Then he looked down at the ring, and</p><p>held up his hand for Hardy to inspect the </p><p>setting. But his right hand remained close </p><p>to his gun. </p><p> “She give that to me.” He attempted to</p><p>grin with one corner of his mouth, his eyes </p><p>half-closed. “She says it’s wuth fourteen </p><p>hawses. A right purty ring—hey, hombre?” </p><p> This strained the gambler’s self-control</p><p>close to the breaking-point. Volcanic rage </p><p>seethed within him, and through a red haze </p><p>the glittering ring mocked him. But he </p><p>held himself steady, and no flicker of flame </p><p>in his eyes gave hint of the storm of rage </p><p>within him. He even essayed a smile as he </p><p>lightly remarked— </p><p> “Nothin’ like bein’ a favorite with the</p><p>ladies.” </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>49 </p><p> He pretended to admire the ring, his mind</p><p>groping madly for some sure method of </p><p>blotting out the man who had so calmly </p><p>muddled his plans. If the gang captured </p><p>the boy, it was plain that he could not </p><p>marry the girl until the Kid was out of the </p><p>way. Then there was Norn to be consid- </p><p>ered. While the rancher evidently had no </p><p>interest in the girl, he would hold himself </p><p>responsible for the boy’s safety. With the </p><p>Kid blocking the way, Norn would have </p><p>time to ascertain that the gang had cap- </p><p>tured the boy, and immediately conclude </p><p>that they were holding the lad for ransom. </p><p>Norn would then come directly to him, </p><p>knowing that he controlled the gang, and </p><p>that meant gun-smoke. </p><p> The gambler’s attitude of indifference</p><p>seemed to satisfy the Kid, for he resumed </p><p>his bucking of the faro game, much to the </p><p>sweating agitation of the dealer Hardy had </p><p>neglected to relieve. But never for a mo- </p><p>ment did the killer relax his distrustful vigi- </p><p>lance. He insisted that the rear of the </p><p>saloon be kept clear of men, and his ever- </p><p>restless eyes traveled from lay-out to doors, </p><p>from doors to the faces of the men lounging </p><p>against the bar, and back to the lay-out. </p><p> Hardy, once, was on the point of snatch-</p><p>ing up the sawed-off shotgun, and taking </p><p>the long chance; but he could not quite free </p><p>his soul of the awe of the Kid’s red record. </p><p>Then a hanger-on slipped in, and, pretend- </p><p>ing to ask for money, managed to whisper </p><p>to the gambler: </p><p> “The Kid’s goin’ to take the girl south</p><p>with him tomorrow. Uncle Charlie’s penned </p><p>himself in, and turnin’ everybody back.” </p><p> Hardy gave the hanger-on a coin and</p><p>waved him away. </p><p> This, thought the gambler, did not help</p><p>matters. To force the girl to marry him, </p><p>he would have to tell her of her brother’s </p><p>peril. Now, Uncle Charlie, having noted </p><p>his friendly relations with the Kid, would </p><p>not permit him within speaking distance </p><p>of the girl. While the Kid might brave the </p><p>thunder of the old Sharpe’s, the gambler </p><p>admitted that he had no stomach for facing </p><p>the buffalo gun. Even if he could get to</p><p>the girl, there was the Kid still blocking his </p><p>game. Therefore, the Apache Kid must </p><p>die ere the dawn broke. </p><p> Perhaps the killer would relax his vigi-</p><p>lance; then one desperate move, and both </p><p>barrels of the shotgun. But he must wait </p><p>until he had a perfect drop on the killer. </p><p>4 </p><p>If the Kid caught him reaching for the shot- </p><p>gun, the gun-master would kill him as he </p><p>had a score of men, within the space of a </p><p>split second. To be sure, he must Mve the </p><p>gun cocked and on the man before dis- </p><p>covered. Even then he was doubtful of his </p><p>ability to pull the triggers before the Kid’s </p><p>magic guns Hashed into action. And there </p><p>was no record of the Kid ever having missed </p><p>a man. </p><p> While the Kid toyed with faro, a town</p><p>character, known as “Sunshine,” entered </p><p>the saloon, stopped short at the end of the </p><p>bar, and stared fascinatedly at the killer. </p><p> Some men twitted Sunshine concerning</p><p>the big, rusty revolver he carried in a raw- </p><p>hide holster. At first the Kid moved </p><p>nervously under the gawkish stare of the </p><p>huge but harmless Sunshine. Then the </p><p>killer noted that the big man was the butt </p><p>of various humorous remarks and classified </p><p>him as harmless. </p><p> Sunshine did not intrude on the Kid, but</p><p>moved from one point of vantage to an- </p><p>other, staring at him with round rabbit </p><p>eyes, fascinated by the killer’s deadlinesSr </p><p>The stare of the harmless Sunshine amused </p><p>the watchers; even the Kid lifted his upper </p><p>lip in his wolf-like grin. </p><p> “Your head’s open,” bantered the killer.</p><p>“Look out for flies.” </p><p> At this sally the watchers laughed as</p><p>courtiers laugh at the mildewed jest of a </p><p>king; but Sunshine continued to stare, his </p><p>face empty as that of a hypnotist’s subject. </p><p> The laughter of the watchers caused the</p><p>Kid to unbend further. Playfully he beck- </p><p>oned Sunshine to him. The big man came </p><p>with heavy, dragging steps. The Kid re- </p><p>lieved him of his big gun, and made a futile </p><p>attempt to turn the rusty, empty cylinder.</p><p>Then he blew cigaret smoke in the muzzle; </p><p>and, with one lightning move, tossed the </p><p>gun back into the rawhide holster. Sun- </p><p>shine looked down at his gun with the blank </p><p>astonishment of a country yokel in whose </p><p>hat a magician has discovered a setting of </p><p>eggs. </p><p>CHAPTER X </p><p>NORN considered the canon a safe </p><p>playground for Dickie. The lad, </p><p>on the old and cautious pony, could </p><p>go no farther than the first waterfall; and </p><p>only an experienced and resourceful rider </p><p>could negotiate any of the narrow game- </p><p>trails that zigzagged skyline-ward. Thus, </p><p>50 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>when Dickie rode away that balmy after- </p><p>noon, the rancher felt no misgivings. The </p><p>lad would return in an hour or two. </p><p> When Dickie had disappeared in the wil-</p><p>lows and cottonwoods that hid the stream </p><p>from view, Norn resolved to inspect his </p><p>young apple orchard that set on some high </p><p>land back from the Hemper road. </p><p> As he rode through the young trees, the</p><p>rancher was puzzled to note that some </p><p>riders had recently crossed his orchard. He </p><p>questioned the necessity of riding through </p><p>tiie plowed ground when there was a hard </p><p>road between the ranch road and the or- </p><p>chard. He found that the mysterious </p><p>riders, had, on exiting from the orchard, </p><p>turned toward the ranch, and then doubled </p><p>back through the orchard. Gradually </p><p>black suspicion began to form in his mind. </p><p>Members of the gang were prowling over </p><p>his ranch. Why? Had they decided to </p><p>break the old truce? </p><p> The rancher circled the orchard and re-</p><p>turned to the ranch-house. Desert Jack </p><p>reported that Dickie had not returned. </p><p> decided to ascertain if the mysterious</p><p>riders had invaded his canon, and at the </p><p>same time, assure himself of the boy’s </p><p>safety. He did not take the canon road, </p><p>but followed a narrow trail along a big ditch </p><p>thal tapped the stream at the falls. </p><p> Pete had several reasons for sending</p><p>Pedro, the only Mexican in the gang, into </p><p>the canon. The Mexican had worked on </p><p>round-up for Norn, and, at times, had been </p><p>given permission to hunt on the big ranch. </p><p>Thus, Pedro was most familiar with the </p><p>trails that led down the sides of the canon. </p><p>If the Mexican were discovered by Norn, </p><p>Pete reasoned, the rancher’s suspicions </p><p>would not be aroused so quickly as they </p><p>would if he found a white man lurking </p><p>in his canon. Then, Pete believed, the </p><p>Mexican could be trusted to do as he was </p><p>told. Pete knew that Pedro stood in awe of his </p><p>anger, and was confident that the Mexican </p><p>would not dare to play a crooked game. </p><p> Pedro dragged his horse down a trail that</p><p>a goat would hesitate to follow, and struck</p><p>the floor of the canon a short distance below </p><p>the waterfall. He concealed his horse in </p><p>some alders and proceeded to watch the road. </p><p> Norn, screened from the Mexican’s view</p><p>by the trees and undergrowth, rode up to </p><p>the waterfall. There, he turned into the </p><p>canon road and began searching for fresh </p><p>tracks of Dickie’s pony. Apparently the </p><p>boy had not come to the falls. The rancher </p><p>dismounted and led his horse some distance </p><p>down the road, studying the old tracks. </p><p>Suddenly his eye caught the movement of </p><p>some creature in the alders. He slipped </p><p>back and secured his saddle-gun. Venison </p><p>was always welcome. With the utmost </p><p>caution he approached the alders. </p><p> The Mexican was intently watching the</p><p>road beyond him, and, when Norn spoke to </p><p>him, he sprang to his feet chattering like a </p><p>startled monkey. </p><p> For a time the rancher studied the shak-</p><p>ing Pedro, and then abruptly ordered— </p><p>“Drop your rifle!” </p><p> The Mexican promptly obeyed. Norn</p><p>relieved him of his six-shooter and knife. </p><p> “Now,” demanded the rancher, with a</p><p>deadly, dominating note in his voice, “why </p><p>are you in my canon?” </p><p> The Mexican began babbling about hunt-</p><p>ing, but Norn silenced him. </p><p> “You did not come to the house and se-</p><p>cure my permission. You slipped into the </p><p>canon like a coyote. Did you expect to </p><p>find deer in the road? Why should I not </p><p>kill you as I would a coyote?” </p><p> The Mexican resumed his babbling.</p><p>“Don Keeng” was a generous man who </p><p>had no thought for one little deer. “Don </p><p>Keeng” was also a man with many things </p><p>on his mind, and must not be disturbed by </p><p>a man merely desiring to hunt on “this </p><p>magnificent ranch.” </p><p> But Pedro’s babbling was wasted on the</p><p>rancher. </p><p> “Walk ahead of me,” Norn ordered.</p><p> He drove the Mexican back to his horse.</p><p>There he secured a rope, and presently </p><p>Pedro was bound hand and foot. </p><p> Norn then took the cleaning-rod from its</p><p>hiding-place in the butt of his gun, and </p><p>carefully screwed it together. His next </p><p>move was to build a little fire. </p><p> As he laid the cleaning-rod in the fire, he</p><p>observed with quiet assurance: </p><p> “This will make you speak the truth,</p><p>Pedro. In a little while you will have a </p><p>taste of hell.” </p><p> Norn knew every twist and turn of the</p><p>Mexican mind. If the gang had broken </p><p>the old truce and was plotting some sort of </p><p>devilment, this was an excellent oppor- </p><p>tunity to get first-hand information. </p><p> The possible capture of Dickie by the</p><p>gang did not enter his mind. The boy was </p><p>probably at the ranch-house now. The </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>51 </p><p>rancher was thinking of his herds. Was </p><p>the gang about to exact tribute from him? </p><p>If so, he must prepare for war. He had no </p><p>intention of burning the Mexican, for he </p><p>was confident that Pedro would speak the </p><p>truth when he felt the iron’s hot breath. </p><p> Pedro, on the other hand, had only the</p><p>capture of the boy in mind. He had been </p><p>watching Norn’s every move with terror- </p><p>widened eyes. When the rancher placed </p><p>the iron in the fire, he sucked in his breath. </p><p>Ah, the torture! Mother of God, who could </p><p>endure the fire torture! </p><p> Norn pulled off the Mexican’s boots.</p><p>Then he examined the iron and thrust it </p><p>back in the flames. </p><p> “Not hot enough,” he observed distinctly,</p><p>for Pedro’s benefit. </p><p> When the iron was red-hot, Norn sud-</p><p>denly jerked it from the flames and sav- </p><p>agely approached the Mexican. </p><p> Pedro’s soul sickened as he felt the hot</p><p>breath of the iron. </p><p> “Speak the truth, thou dog,” gritted</p><p>Norn in Spanish, “or walk through hell.” </p><p> “By the cross, the truth I speak!” howled</p><p>the frantic Mexican. “The brother of the </p><p>beautiful senorita is sought by Pete that </p><p>Senor Hardy may give to each man much </p><p>gold.” </p><p> Norn stopped short, and then, tossing</p><p>aside the iron, swiftly unbound the Mexi- </p><p>can and hurled him toward his horse. </p><p> “To the ranch,” he snapped; and Pedro,</p><p>gray with fear, galloped ahead of him. </p><p> The Mexican knew that he could not</p><p>now return to the gang. Pete would not </p><p>listen to explanations. His safety lay in </p><p>keeping close to Norn. </p><p> Norn, as he rode even with him, read the</p><p>Mexican’s thoughts. </p><p> “You will stay at my place, Pedro,” he</p><p>said. “Your friends would kill you if I</p><p>sent them word that Pedro answered when </p><p>the little hot iron spoke to him. Is it not </p><p>the part of wisdom to be my man?” </p><p> ‘Si, senor,” the Mexican quickly agreed,</p><p>breathing heavily, “it is the part of wisdom.” </p><p> “Then I will forget what has passed, and</p><p>will say that Pedro had my permission to </p><p>hunt in the canon.” </p><p>THE rancher* had not neglected to </p><p>watch the road, and, when they </p><p>came to the place where Dickie had </p><p>turned down the stream, his sharp eyes dis- </p><p>cerned the tell-tale hoof-prints in the mud. </p><p>Perhaps one of the gang had intercepted </p><p>the boy, and either inveigled or forced him </p><p>to ride down the stream. He spurred up </p><p>his horse, and, with Pedro galloping ahead, </p><p>dashed back to the ranch-house. </p><p> Placing Pedro in charge of Desert Jack,</p><p>Norn hurriedly told the foreman of the </p><p>Mexican’s confession. </p><p> “You’ll stay here,” the rancher planned.</p><p>“Joe and the other three boys will go to </p><p>the Bundy camp at Witch-talk and wait </p><p>for me. It’s getting dark right now, and </p><p>no moon for trailing. I’ll go to Hemper </p><p>for more men. Tell the boys to search Big </p><p>Wash, but to show no lights. I should join </p><p>them before dawn. Tell them to scout, </p><p>but to steer clear of a fight. When I join </p><p>them, we’ll comb the country north to the </p><p>desert hills, and guard the water-holes. </p><p>I’ll send you word when we establish a main </p><p>camp.” </p><p> Norn secured his two made-to-order six-</p><p>shooters, sweet weapons and perfectly bal- </p><p>anced, and exchanged his saddle-gun for a </p><p>heavy hunting-rifle.	'</p><p> The four men under Desert Jack’s ordffrs^-</p><p>were soon ready for the trail, heavily armed </p><p>and prepared for any desert emergency. </p><p> Norn mounted his spotted horse, which</p><p>he reserved for long rides, and racked down </p><p>the Hemper road. </p><p> It was plain, thought Norn, that Hardy,</p><p>knowing the girl’s wealth, expected a heavy </p><p>ransom for the boy. There could be no </p><p>other motive. Certainly the gambler would</p><p>not expect to win the girl’s favor by such </p><p>methods. Yet, if the gang held the boy, </p><p>Hardy would be in a position to demand </p><p>almost any sacrifice of the lad’s sister. </p><p>Whatever his motive, the gambler must be </p><p>placed under guard and held as hostage for </p><p>Dickie’s safety. </p><p> To save the girl much unnecessary an-</p><p>guish, as well as to avoid the reproach she </p><p>would *surely heap upon him for his lax </p><p>guardianship of her brother, Norn decided </p><p>to exact a promise of silence from Uncle </p><p>Charlie until they had made every possible </p><p>effort to wrest Dickie from the clutches of </p><p>the gang. </p><p> As Norn rode into Hemper he noted that</p><p>Hardy’s saloon was ablaze with light, but </p><p>that the Hemper House was as dark as a </p><p>tomb. He tossed the reins over the pinto’s </p><p>head and vaulted the rail at the end of the </p><p>porch. Immediately Uncle Charlie chal- </p><p>lenged him. </p><p>52 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “It’s Norn—Norn!” the rancher answered</p><p>impatiently. “Open up.” </p><p> Uncle Charlie admitted the rancher, and,</p><p>before Norn could tell him of Dickie, the </p><p>old man began cursing the Apache Kid. </p><p> “Talk straight,” the rancher remon-</p><p>started. “Calm yourself.” </p><p> The landlord finally managed to give a</p><p>clear account of the events of the afternoon. </p><p> “And,” he concluded, “the murderin’</p><p>devil says he’ll take my girl south with him </p><p>in the mornin’.” </p><p> A white figure, unseen by the men, stole</p><p>down the stairway. </p><p> “Then,” said Norn, in a matter-of-fact</p><p>tone, “there is nothing left to do but stop </p><p>this Apache Kid.” </p><p> “That’s it—that’s it,” the old man eagerly</p><p>assented. But a thought of the Kid’s rec- </p><p>ord made him add nervously: “You’ll have </p><p>to use your head, King. The Apache Kid </p><p>is quicker than death itself. I think we’d </p><p>better try gettin’ the girl out of town.” </p><p>“No,” Norn firmly objected. “Will you </p><p>let some cow-thief drive you to that?” </p><p>—t:But I’m old and slow,” groaned Uncle </p><p>Charlie. “Lord, man, what can I do?” </p><p>“Stay here, and stand guard. I’ll take a </p><p>chance on the Apache Kid.” </p><p> Norn now thought to tell Uncle Charlie</p><p>of Dickie, but, ere he could speak, Dora </p><p>glided over and touched his arm. The </p><p>rancher whirled and the movement brought </p><p>him close to her. </p><p> “You must not risk your life for me,”</p><p>she softly pleaded. “I overheard Uncle’s </p><p>suggestion. If you will assist me, I can </p><p>escape. Dickie can follow later.” </p><p> The rancher flinched inwardly when she</p><p>mentioned Dickie, but made no reply. He </p><p>could not tell her of the danger that threat- </p><p>ened her brother, and it was not his nature </p><p>to discuss a man he was soon to view </p><p>through gun-smoke.</p><p> His silence told her that her pleading had</p><p>been in vain. Her hands were now clutch- </p><p>ing both his arms. Must she make the final </p><p>appeal? Must she tell him that she had </p><p>more fear for his safety than for her own? </p><p> “I do not want you to go,” she mur-</p><p>mured so faintly that he was forced to bend </p><p>his head and ask her to repeat the words. </p><p> “I do not want you to go,” she repeated;</p><p>and there was no mistaking the warm, ten- </p><p>der note in her voice. </p><p> Norn’s heart leaped madly. He wanted</p><p>to sweep her to his breast, to release the </p><p>pent-up flood of tenderness in his heart. </p><p>But he held himself quiescent, fearful that </p><p>she was laboring under a mere passing emo- </p><p>tion. He so intensely desired her love </p><p>that he dared not show a glimmer of true </p><p>sentiment, lest he meet with that indiffer- </p><p>ence that had wrecked the hopes of so many </p><p>men. She must come to him calm and </p><p>unharrowed with emotion, and give him the </p><p>sign that symboled her heart’s desire. He </p><p>would not pursue, he would not babble </p><p>madly. Her love must flower naturally. </p><p> Gently he drew away from her and started</p><p>toward the door. </p><p> “Oh,” she exclaimed, desperately, “why</p><p>can you not see-” </p><p> “See what?” he asked, halting abruptly.</p><p> Training, pride, the idea that the woman</p><p>must wait, wait, wait until the man speaks, </p><p>held back the words she yearned to say— </p><p>three little words, “I love you.” </p><p> Then, though her hands groped toward</p><p>him, he backed swiftly through the door, </p><p>and was gone. </p><p> Norn did not forget that he was about to</p><p>battle with a first-class gunman, and was </p><p>fully aware that the Kid could, under ordi- </p><p>nary conditions, shade the gun-play of any </p><p>man in the desert country. But he had </p><p>decided not to approach the killer under </p><p>ordinary conditions. </p><p> With feigned carelessness, he approached</p><p>the swinging doors of the saloon, and paused</p><p>for a breath to locate liis man. He saw the </p><p>Apache Kid lounging against the wall. In </p><p>the center of the saloon, and even with the </p><p>Kid, stood the gaping Sunshine, staring at </p><p>the killer. </p><p> Norn entered swiftly.</p><p> “You, Sunshine,” he shouted, with well-</p><p>feigned rage, “what do you mean by steal- </p><p>ing my horse?” </p><p> Poor Sunshine, stunned by the accusa-</p><p>tion and chilled with fear, could only blink </p><p>and gape. </p><p> Norn advanced a pace, and pulled his</p><p>guns. This movement caused the Kid to </p><p>face the seemingly angry man and to drop </p><p>his hands on the butts of the low-hung </p><p>guns. Then, realizing that it was not his </p><p>affair, he relaxed, pleasantly anticipating </p><p>bloodshed. The killer’s hands dropped </p><p>away from his gun butts. He took out his </p><p>book of cigaret-paper. The fool had stolen </p><p>a horse and would soon die. </p><p> Hardy was deeply puzzled. Why should</p><p>Norn, the silent and dignified, stoop to </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>53 </p><p>frightening a town fool? Other watchers </p><p>grinned. Norn was merely indulging in a </p><p>little sport. Norn smiled bleakly. Yes, </p><p>that was it; the rancher was having a little </p><p>fun with Sunshine. Even the Kid saw </p><p>through the dramatic gun-play, and frowned </p><p>disappointedly. He had hoped to witness </p><p>a killing. </p><p> “Can you dance?” rasped Norn. “Say,</p><p>you Sunshine, can you dance?” </p><p> The big yokel essayed a few ox-like steps.</p><p> “Not fast enough,” yelled Norn, cocking</p><p>his guns. </p><p> The Kid, lounging against the wall,</p><p>grinned at the clumsiness of Sunshine. The </p><p>fool was surely frightened out of what little </p><p>wits he possessed. </p><p> “Dance faster,” insisted Norn; then, in</p><p>one swift, sure movement, he swung his </p><p>guns from Sunshine to the Kid and released </p><p>the smooth hammers. </p><p> In the infinitesimal fraction of a second</p><p>required for the lead to speed from the guns </p><p>to his body, the Kid caught Norn’s cold </p><p>eye glittering across the gleaming barrels. </p><p>Automatically, the killer’s hands sought </p><p>his guns, but the lead shut off the nerve </p><p>connection between brain and hands ere </p><p>the fingers could close on the weapons. </p><p> The Apache Kid slumped against the</p><p>wall, slid to a sitting posture and then </p><p>toppled over. </p><p> Norn holstered one gun and leaped to</p><p>the side of the killer. </p><p> He rolled the body over with his foot and</p><p>pulled Dora’s ring from the slim finger that </p><p>would never again circle a gun-butt. </p><p> Sunshine, as Norn’s guns exploded, gave</p><p>a good imitation of an insane kangaroo. </p><p>He dodged and plunged, and tossed his </p><p>arms, and finally dived under a card-table. </p><p>Up he rose, carrying the table with him, </p><p>in a wild stampede for the back door. </p><p>Striking the door, he fought the table for a </p><p>breath, dropped it, and gyrated like a</p><p>whirling dervish through the door. In the </p><p>alley, he launched himself forward; and, </p><p>striking barrels and boxes, crashed through </p><p>them like a frenzied bull. At last he got </p><p>clear of the obstructions and passed up the </p><p>alley in wild flight, howling at every jump. </p><p>He ran until exhausted, and only slunk back </p><p>to the town when he had, after much labo- </p><p>rious examination of his body, assured him- </p><p>self that he was not mortally wounded. </p><p> Hardy had been a puzzled spectator of</p><p>the baiting of Sunshine; but, as Norn’s guns </p><p>spoke and the Kid slumped, the audacious </p><p>generalship of the rancher stunned the </p><p>gambler, who had been trying in vain to </p><p>think of some way to get the drop on the </p><p>Kid. He saw Norn bend over the body, </p><p>but the roulette-wheel prevented his seeing </p><p>the rancher strip the ring from the dead </p><p>man’s finger. Then, ere he could fathom </p><p>all the rancher’s motives, he found himself </p><p>staring into those same guns that had sent </p><p>the Kid to his long sleep. </p><p> “Hands up!” Norn ordered sharply.</p><p> The gambler read death in Norn’s</p><p>glance, and his hands shot ceilingward. </p><p>THE watchers did not interfere, </p><p>though, at that moment, there were </p><p>many Hardy partisans in the room. </p><p>Norn had killed the Apache Kid, and no </p><p>one now dared to dispute his will. </p><p> Norn holstered one gun, and, slipping</p><p>back of the gambler, proceeded to disarm </p><p>him. </p><p> “To the hotel,” Norn ordered in a low</p><p>voice.	^_</p><p> The gambler, feeling the pressure of a</p><p>gun-barrel against his spine, marched as </p><p>ordered—across the street and on to the </p><p>hotel porch. </p><p> Norn now proposed to tell Uncle Charlie</p><p>of the danger that threatened Dickie, and </p><p>turn Hardy over to the old man as hostage </p><p>for the boy. </p><p> Dora and her uncle had heard the shoot-</p><p>ing, and were on the porch as Hardy and </p><p>Norn came up. The girl could hardly re- </p><p>press the prayer of thankfulness that rose</p><p>to her lips. She had heard the shots, but </p><p>the intimate details of the passing of the </p><p>Apache Kid were not within the range of her </p><p>woman’s imagination. She could only com- </p><p>prehend that Norn was unhurt. </p><p> Uncle Charlie noted Hardy’s raised hands,</p><p>.but asked no questions. He held the buf- </p><p>falo gun at the ready and waited for Norn </p><p>to speak. </p><p> To Norn the ring symbolized his ability</p><p>to encircle the girl with his protection. </p><p>Holding a gun on Hardy, he fumbled in </p><p>his'shirt-pocket for the ring. Yet he re- </p><p>frained from even a hint of heroics, and </p><p>quietly said— </p><p> “Here’s your ring, Miss Dora.”</p><p> The girl’s imagination then caught a</p><p>glimpse of the action required to take that </p><p>ring from the Apache Kid. Inwardly she </p><p>shuddered at the thought of taking that </p><p>54 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>which had encircled a dead man’s finger, </p><p>but the realization that the ring was a sym- </p><p>bol of Norn’s willingness to risk his life in </p><p>her defense outweighed her qualms, and she </p><p>stepped toward him, hand outstretched. </p><p>This move placed her even with Hardy, </p><p>whose right hand swiftly descended on her </p><p>shoulder and hurled her against Norn. </p><p> In two bounds the desperate gambler had</p><p>reached the end of the porch and cleared the </p><p>rail. Uncle Charlie, slow and heavy, swung </p><p>his Sharpe’s, but Hardy had mounted </p><p>Norn’s horse before the old man could get </p><p>the buffalo gun in action. </p><p> Uncle Charlie made a mighty effort to</p><p>reach the rail, but crashed into a rocking- </p><p>chair and went down, cursing and roaring. </p><p>In some fashion the old Sharpe’s was dis- </p><p>charged and the great slug whizzed across </p><p>the street, passed through the front of the </p><p>saloon, struck one of the big hanging lamps, </p><p>passed through the back wall, and then </p><p>through a covered wagon, missing by a </p><p>hand’s-breadth the occupant thereof, who </p><p>was sleeping off a day’s debauch. </p><p>"'The mysterious shot created a panic in </p><p>the saloon and there followed a blind rush </p><p>for the doors. The killing of the Kid and </p><p>the forced departure of Hardy had touched </p><p>the nerves of the habitues of the saloon. </p><p>Suspicion and old hates flamed up in the </p><p>mad scramble. A half-intoxicated man </p><p>jerked out his gun and began firing. The </p><p>chimneyless lamp blazed up and the sag- </p><p>ging cheesecloth ceiling caught fire. The </p><p>fighting, struggling men at both doors now </p><p>had no thought save to escape. </p><p> The jam at the front door finally broke,</p><p>and its component parts separated and </p><p>lurched and stumbled into the street. By </p><p>this time the fire had gained such headway </p><p>that those who had stampeded so blindly </p><p>from the inferno could only turn and </p><p>dumbly stare at the flames. Then it oc- </p><p>curred to one of the watchers that the </p><p>whole town might burn, and he raised a wild </p><p>cry of “Fire! Fire! Eire!” This stirred the </p><p>paralyzed ones into activity, and the </p><p>street was soon full of excited men, rush- </p><p>ing hither and thither, bawling conflicting </p><p>orders and acting not unlike a drove of</p><p>frantic cattle. </p><p> Norn was near the edge of the porch</p><p>when Hardy hurled the girl into his arms. </p><p>One of her hands struck down his gun and </p><p>she fell heavily against him. To save him- </p><p>self, he staggered down the steps, carrying </p><p>her with him. Before he could disengage </p><p>himself from her clutching hands, and run </p><p>around the porch, Hardy was through </p><p>the cottonwoods and speeding toward the </p><p>desert. </p><p> The bedlam in the saloon, following the</p><p>bellow of Uncle Charlie’s rifle, checked </p><p>Norn at the end of the porch. He returned </p><p>to the girl to witness the stampede. Then, </p><p>as the flames gained headway in the dry </p><p>shell, he realized that he could not now </p><p>expect the men of Hemper to join him in </p><p>the search for Dickie. The town was in </p><p>confusion, and a posse friendly to him and </p><p>the landlord could not be raised until the </p><p>Hemperites had regained some semblance </p><p>of calmness. Also, Uncle Charlie’s account </p><p>of his unsuccessful attempt to enlist a vigi- </p><p>lance committee to dispose of the Apache </p><p>Kid indicated tliat the raising of a posse </p><p>to take the trail of the gang would be a </p><p>difficult matter, even under normal condi- </p><p>tions. </p><p> Uncle Charlie, having fought the rocker</p><p>to a draw, began bellowing that the whole </p><p>street was doomed. </p><p> Men came running with buckets and</p><p>made some attempt to save the saloon, but </p><p>they soon fell back to concentrate their </p><p>efforts on the hotel side of the street. </p><p> Uncle Charlie summoned his help and</p><p>formed a small bucket brigade which kept </p><p>the front of the hotel drenched with water. </p><p> Norn was loath to leave the girl while</p><p>the fire raged, and waited until assured that </p><p>the hotel was safe. As he watched the </p><p>fire, he became aware of the girl’s close </p><p>presence and felt her hand slip into </p><p>his. </p><p> “It was very foolish of me to accuse you</p><p>of deceiving poor little Maria,” she hur- </p><p>riedly unburdened her heart, fearful that </p><p>he would plunge into action before she </p><p>could voice her regret. “Will you forgive</p><p>me?” </p><p> “I guess this side of the street is safe</p><p>now,” he observed, pretending not to have </p><p>heard her. </p><p> “Yes; I guess so,” she murmured for-</p><p>lornly; and slowly withdrew her hand. </p><p> Then Uncle Charlie came and insisted</p><p>that the girl seek the safe seclusion of the </p><p>Indians’ cabin at the rear of the hotel. </p><p> When the old man had departed with</p><p>Dora, Norn decided to postpone telling </p><p>him of Dickie. Hardy was, doubtless, in </p><p>the desert now, and, when he heard of the </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>55 </p><p>destruction of his saloon, would not </p><p>hesitate to recoup his loss by demanding a </p><p>staggering ransom for the boy. The situa- </p><p>tion, Norn concluded, called for immediate </p><p>action, and he resolved to take the trail with </p><p>what men he had. He would do all in his </p><p>power to recover the boy, and, if he failed, </p><p>he would then send a man to town to sum- </p><p>mon aid. By the time he and his men, </p><p>now waiting at Witch-talk, had thoroughly </p><p>scouted the desert basin, the friendly Hem- </p><p>perites might be induced to listen to an </p><p>appeal for help. </p><p> Norn found the proprietor of the hard-</p><p>ware store, and quickly purchased a rifle </p><p>and ammunition. At the stage stable, the </p><p>rancher grumbled at the inferiority of the </p><p>horse he was forced to accept, doubting </p><p>that the animal would last until he recov- </p><p>ered his faithful pinto. </p><p> Cautiously Norn rode into the desert.</p><p>Hardy might double back and ambush </p><p>him, since the gambler had not only the </p><p>tireless pinto but the heavy hunting-rifie </p><p>left hanging on the saddle. </p><p> CHAPTER XI</p><p>BUNDY, as he began to reason </p><p>calmly, realized that he could not </p><p>hope to reach Hemper in time for </p><p>the doctor to save him from an agonizing </p><p>death. He might, however, be able to get </p><p>to Norn’s ranch. But the problem was to </p><p>reach the ranch without being sighted by </p><p>the gang. He knew that Pete and his men </p><p>were now at Twenty-eight Palms, and that </p><p>he could not slip past their camp before </p><p>dawn. Even if he turned the boy over to </p><p>the gang, he could not escape the charge of </p><p>treachery. They would instantly deduce </p><p>that it was the snake venom in his veins </p><p>that had brought him back to them, and </p><p>no desire to play fair. Also, no member of </p><p>the gang possessed any antidote for snake- </p><p>bite. He had much to lose and nothing to </p><p>gain by returning to the gang. </p><p> Despite the desperateness of his situa-</p><p>tion, the man’s mind was not solely occu- </p><p>pied with selfish thoughts. Vaguely, it </p><p>now came to him, that had he not been </p><p>bitten by the snake, he would not have</p><p>carried out his program, but would have </p><p>eventually taken Dickie to the Norn ranch. </p><p>The lad had roused some latent parental </p><p>instinct in the man, and he found himself </p><p>considering Dickie’s welfare with a greater </p><p>concern that he accorded the ever-increasing </p><p>pain in his hand and arm. </p><p> With some difficulty he saddled the horses</p><p>and led the way up a tributary of the </p><p>canon, finally coming out on the main </p><p>ridge of the desert range. </p><p> Halting to adjust the tourniquet, he told</p><p>Dickie his plans. </p><p> “We’ll strike along this ridge till we come</p><p>to Tunnel Canon. There’s water at the </p><p>head of it, and generally a hatful of water </p><p>in the old tunnel near the mouth. We’ll </p><p>then go on to Norn’s ranch. How you </p><p>feelin’, kid?” </p><p> “Pretty good, thank you,” Dickie bravely</p><p>assured him, though stiff and sore, and ex- </p><p>hausted from the strain on his nerves. </p><p> “Game as they make ’em,” mumbled</p><p>Bundy, fighting back a curious drowsiness. </p><p> They moved on. Bundy found himself</p><p>bending over the saddle horn. The ground </p><p>seemed a bed of black velvet that offered to </p><p>him heavenly repose. Only with the ut- </p><p>most effort could he hold himself erect in the </p><p>saddle. He wanted to slump, to surrender. </p><p> Then came the strange sensation of his</p><p>body being attached to the arm instead of </p><p>the arm to the body. The body^was cold </p><p>and the arm aflame. The body seemed </p><p>small and shriveled, the arm huge and </p><p>bursting with blood. </p><p> Then, the drowsiness rushed his faculties,</p><p>and he found himself seated on the ground, </p><p>with Dickie tugging at his shoulder, and </p><p>whimpering: </p><p> “You said you must get to a doctor, or</p><p>you’d die. Please don’t die—please don’t </p><p>die.” </p><p> The man lurched to his feet and managed</p><p>to get into the saddle. </p><p> “Keep me movin’, son,” he mumbled,</p><p>thickly. “Keep me movin’.” </p><p> With the venom raging in his arm,</p><p>Bundy’s course up the ridge was erratic and </p><p>punctuated with frequent halts. </p><p> At times the fear of agonizing death</p><p>gripped the vitals of the man and he cursed </p><p>wildly to revive his sinking courage, but </p><p>through his curses ran a thin note of despair. </p><p> “We can’t make it,” he blubbered; and</p><p>almost fell from his horse. </p><p> The animal halted abruptly, expecting</p><p>his rider to dismount. </p><p> Bundy sprawled over the saddle horn and</p><p>slid to the ground. </p><p> “Go on,” he yelled hoarsely to the boy</p><p>who had quickly dismounted. “I'm done.” </p><p>56 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> While Bundy could stand hardship, en-</p><p>dure hunger and thirst, his mind could not </p><p>rise free and clear above the sljarp, subtle </p><p>workings of the venom. Fatalistic thought </p><p>dominated him, and threw wide the gates </p><p>of his physical being to the poison. Had he </p><p>firmly held to the idea that his blood was </p><p>clean and pure, he would have, no doubt </p><p>much lessened the pressure that aided the </p><p>venom on its work. But he surrendered, </p><p>his mind black with snake-thoughts, poison- </p><p>thoughts, death-thoughts. His mind in- </p><p>vited the venom to do its worst and thus he </p><p>succumbed far more quickly than he would </p><p>had his every thought been against the idea </p><p>of surrender. </p><p> “Go on!” he repeated hopelessly. “I’m</p><p>done—mountain over there—go on—go </p><p>on.” </p><p> Dickie, his childishness burned out by the</p><p>fires of harsh experience, put his arms about </p><p>the man, and strove to push him toward his </p><p>horse. </p><p> “Hurry,” panted the boy. “You are</p><p>very sick and must get to a doctor.” </p><p> Bundy sat down abruptly, mumbling-</p><p> “No use—no use.”</p><p> “Get up,” Dickie screamed. “You told</p><p>me to keep you moving. Don’t you see </p><p>I’m helping you—don’t you understand?” </p><p> But the man did not move.</p><p> The boy now realized that pleadings wrere</p><p>in vain. He must keep the man moving— </p><p>but how? Perhaps insult would stir the </p><p>huge, inert hulk before him. He could </p><p>think of nothing but the small boy ana- </p><p>thema of- </p><p>Cowardly, cowardly custard, </p><p>Ate a cup of mustard. </p><p> This he shrilled close to Bundy’s ear, and</p><p>its effect was magical. </p><p> The boy was calling him a coward—a</p><p>small, sickly boy was calling him, Rat</p><p>Bundy, leader of men, a coward. His mind </p><p>threw aside its black incubus of death- </p><p>thoughts. What was a nip from a rattler? </p><p>Nothing. He was strong and his blood </p><p>was pure. He would survive. He rose to </p><p>his feet, jaws set, and mounted his horse. </p><p> Dickie never knew the terrible effort it</p><p>cost Bundy to hold his mind to the thought </p><p>of survival. The man now sat in his saddle, </p><p>rigidly erect, fighting battle after battle </p><p>against the insidious venom. He was de- </p><p>termined now to reach the mouth of Tunnel </p><p>Canon, from which point the boy could </p><p>plainly see the green fields of Norn’s ranch. </p><p> Noble thoughts for the boy’s safety</p><p>strengthened him. He found that such </p><p>thoughts kept his mind clear, and that </p><p>thoughts of self confused his sense of direc- </p><p>tion, and weakened his resistance. </p><p> The tributary that led into Tunnel Canon</p><p>was clogged with cat-claws that forced </p><p>them to dismount and lead their horses. </p><p> The man, holding firmly to the resolve</p><p>to guide the boy to safety, floundered </p><p>through the implacable cat-claw, oblivious </p><p>to its cruel hooked thorns. But when they </p><p>entered Tunnel Canon, the old thoughts </p><p>charged the citadel of his resolve, and he </p><p>slumped down in the sand, his shirt in </p><p>tatters, his face, hands and chest bleeding </p><p>from countless scratches. Dickie had fared </p><p>much better; the man had broken a trail for </p><p>him. </p><p> The lad now saw that the man was again</p><p>losing courage, and he repeated the small- </p><p>boy anathema which brought Bundy to his </p><p>feet, cursing himself for a spineless quitter. </p><p>And once more he mounted his horse, with </p><p>the venom singing a song of blind hate in his </p><p>veins. </p><p> Tunnel Canon, though its walls were</p><p>abrupt, was spacious and smooth-floored. </p><p>The ponies racked on freely, Dickie leading </p><p>the way. </p><p> “Look fer tunnel—left-hand side,” Bundy</p><p>warned, not quite sure that he was in the </p><p>right canon. </p><p> Then suddenly Dickie discerned a black</p><p>blot in the canon wall, and veered over a</p><p>little. </p><p> “Here’s the tunnel!” he joyously ex-</p><p>claimed. “We’re all right now.” </p><p> “Keep goin’,” the man groaned, as he</p><p>rode even with the boy. “Keep goin’.” </p><p>SSpP THERE was now a pallid hint &lt;?f </p><p>pidawn in the eastern sky. The worn </p><p>and weary lad sniffed the aromatic </p><p>dawn-scents, and felt his spirits revive. </p><p>Soon would come the kindly sunlight, and </p><p>all would be well. </p><p> When they reached the mouth of Tunnel</p><p>Canon, Rain-maker had emerged from the </p><p>gloom, and stood, wreathed in shimmering </p><p>haze. </p><p> “There’s the ranch!” shouted Dickie.</p><p>“See the trees and the house? That’s it— </p><p>that’s it.” </p><p> But the habit of resistance had now</p><p>The Survivor </p><p>57 </p><p>gained a foothold in the mind of the man. </p><p>They were in sight of the ranch, and there he </p><p>could at least secure whisky which was </p><p>supposed to counteract the effect of rattle- </p><p>snake venom. He would fight his way </p><p>through. The boy would not again have </p><p>to remind him that he was a coward. </p><p> He might have ridden on without a</p><p>break, had he not thought to examine his </p><p>hand and arm in the clear morning light. </p><p>The swelling gave his courage a severe set- </p><p>back. He sagged forward, and his horse </p><p>promptly halted. He slid from the saddle, </p><p>and stood, his arms hanging over the horse’s </p><p>neck, a hopeless, sodden figure of despair. </p><p> “Come on, please hurry,” Dickie began</p><p>pleading. </p><p> “There’s the ranch,” Bundy said mourn-</p><p>fully. “Go to it. I’m sick—sick-” </p><p> “I’ll stay with you, then,” the boy calmly</p><p>decided. “I won’t leave you.” </p><p> Huh, thought the man, the kid was a real</p><p>friend who wouldn’t leave him to die like a </p><p>poisoned wolf, alone and forsaken. The </p><p>boy was game, and he, a man was giving up, </p><p>surrendering while he yet had strength. </p><p>He managed to heave himself into the </p><p>saddle. </p><p> Dickie led the way across Big Wash, and</p><p>up to the ranch-house. Bundy, now that </p><p>he had rcached the end of the terrible trail, </p><p>slumped completely and would have fallen </p><p>from the horse had not Desert Jack caught </p><p>him in his strong arms. </p><p> “He took me from some men and brought</p><p>me home,” quickly vouchsafed Dickie, true </p><p>to his promise. Then, in answer to a </p><p>puzzled exclamation from Desert Jack, </p><p>he excitedly poured forth a torrent of </p><p>words. </p><p> “Big rattlesnake bit him—I cut his</p><p>finger—then I sucked the blood out—then </p><p>he was going to die—and then-” </p><p> “You look purty peaked yourself, kid,”</p><p>interrupted the foreman, as he beckoned </p><p>to Pedro. “Go to the house and lie</p><p>down.” </p><p> Dickie rode up to the porch and dis-</p><p>mounted. Now that he was free of all </p><p>responsibility, weariness overpowered him, </p><p>and it required a desperate effort for him to </p><p>reach the big divan in the living-room. </p><p>There he sprawled out, and fell into the </p><p>dreamless sleep of one who has fought a </p><p>good fight and won. And, to the end, he </p><p>kept his pact with Bundy. </p><p> With Pedro’s assistance, Desert Jack</p><p>half-carried Bundy to the bunk-house. </p><p>The foreman deeming whisky a sovereign </p><p>remedy for snakebite, forced great swallows </p><p>of the raw liquor down Bundy’s tliroat. </p><p>Then, calling on the Chinese servants for </p><p>assistance, he bound up Bundy’s hand </p><p>and arm in raw beef. </p><p> “You’d better hit fer town, Pedro,”</p><p>Desert Jack told the Mexican, when they </p><p>had finished poulticing Bundy’s arm. “Get </p><p>Doc Cunningham out here on the jump.” </p><p> Then the foreman thought of Norn's</p><p>orders. The rancher would hold him re- </p><p>sponsible for any treachery on the Mexican's </p><p>part. But Pedro was the only available </p><p>man. A Chinese could not be trusted </p><p>away from a house. Also, the boy was </p><p>safe, and the holding of Pedro now was of no </p><p>importance. </p><p> As the Mexican turned to go, Desert Jack</p><p>warned him that “a quick killin’’ would be </p><p>the reward “fer any greaser tricks.” </p><p> The foreman stood in the doorway of the</p><p>bunk-house, rifle in hand, and watched the </p><p>Mexican depart. Then he returned to the </p><p>pouring of whisky down the throat of the </p><p>hapless Bundy. </p><p> Bundy, in his way, had always been far</p><p>more considerate of the Mexican’s feelings </p><p>than had Pete or any of the other desert </p><p>rovers who classified “greasers” with </p><p>Indians and negroes. The Mexican was </p><p>not a stranger to gratitude. </p><p> Desert Jack’s warning was unnecessary.</p><p>In his heart of hearts, the Mexican was </p><p>weary of the rather lonely life his color had </p><p>forced him to lead. He was a member of </p><p>the gang, but none of the white men,</p><p>barring Bundy, had ever shown him a </p><p>gleam of kindness, or counseled with him. </p><p>He would slip into Hemper, find the doctor, </p><p>and then flee north, far beyond the gang’s </p><p>reach. In sweet San Gabriel he would find </p><p>his own people, a guitar to strum, and a </p><p>dark-eyed woman to make time pass quickly. </p><p>Aye, he was fortunate to escape from the </p><p>hated gringos, the ever-restless ones, the </p><p>seekers of trouble. </p><p> Though he gave a grunt of astonishment</p><p>at the havoc the fire had wrought, Pedro, as </p><p>he entered Hemper, did not pause to inspect </p><p>the smoking ruins, but trotted past the </p><p>hotel intent on reaching the doctor’s office. </p><p>He reined in abruptly as he caught a glimpse </p><p>of the doctor coming out of the drug-store, </p><p>and hailed the medico just as he paused at </p><p>the hotel steps to speak to Dora. </p><p>58 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Bundy heem get snakebite. You go</p><p>queek Norn ranch.” </p><p> “All right,” snapped the doctor. “I’ll</p><p>start right away.” </p><p> The Mexican, having paid his debt of</p><p>gratitude to Bundy, galloped around the </p><p>hotel, and the desert country knew him no </p><p>more. </p><p> Pedro’s display of graceful horsmanship,</p><p>as he dashed past, attracted Uie girl’s atten- </p><p>tion, and she vaguely recalled fragments of </p><p>his speech to the doctor. </p><p> “Snakebite—Norn ranch.”</p><p> Some men, poking in the ashes of the</p><p>ruins, shouted to the doctor as he past </p><p>sped in his buckboard. </p><p> Then, the thought that Dickie might have</p><p>been bitten by a rattlesnake plunged into </p><p>her mind with terrifying suddenness. The </p><p>doctor was now beyond hailing distance, </p><p>and she ran into the hotel to tell Uncle </p><p>Charlie of her fears. </p><p> While Dora had slept a few hours, the old</p><p>man had guarded his property all night, </p><p>with no thought of sleep. Now he was pre- </p><p>paring to give his old body the rest it de- </p><p>manded, and was in no mood to be alarmed </p><p>by unfounded forebodings. </p><p> “Don’t be foolish, Dora,” he grumbled, as</p><p>he tugged at his shoes. “If Dickie was bit </p><p>they’d bring him in on the jump. You </p><p>don’t suppose that Doc Cunningham </p><p>wouldn’t tell you if it was the boy that was </p><p>nipped? I swear, Dora, you’re like most </p><p>wimmin—always a-borrowin’ trouble. Holy </p><p>cripes, I never put in such a night in my </p><p>life! Now run along and let me sleep.” </p><p>“But, uncle,” she persisted, “it might be </p><p>Dickie. You know he is so daring and </p><p>impetuous.” </p><p> “Well, Doc Cunningham ought to be</p><p>back in a few hours and then you’ll know. </p><p>Now let me sleep.” </p><p> Slowly Dora returned to the porch. An</p><p>hour dragged by and then she saw one of the</p><p>stage stable helpers start up the street. </p><p> “Bring my horse, please,” she called to</p><p>the helper; and hurried upstairs to don her </p><p>riding-habit. </p><p> Later, as she cantered down the desert</p><p>road, she amused herself with picturing </p><p>Dickie’s surprise when she rode up to the </p><p>ranch. Her forebodings, she now realized, </p><p>had arisen from loneliness. Dickie had </p><p>been gone a long time, it seemed to her, and </p><p>she was merely lonesome. </p><p> The lad would have many stories to tell</p><p>her, and Norn would bring them back to </p><p>town. </p><p> Hers was a mind that rarely long enter-</p><p>tained disagreeable thoughts or memories. </p><p>She was on her way to Dickie now, </p><p>and would, doubtless, see the man she </p><p>loved. </p><p> Also, she had a good feminine excuse for</p><p>invading Norn’s little empire. She would </p><p>tell him, calmly and without the quiver of </p><p>an eyelash, she had heard that some one at </p><p>the ranch had been bitten by a snake, and </p><p>that she had come to make sure the unfortu- </p><p>nate was not Dickie. Then Norn would </p><p>show her the ranch, and in the quiet balmy </p><p>evening they would return to town. </p><p> She admitted a childish curiosity re-</p><p>garding the man’s surroundings and manner </p><p>of living. Did he possess all those things of </p><p>which Uncle Charlie had hinted, books, rich </p><p>furniture, piano and servants. </p><p> Now that she loved a man, she found she</p><p>could not reason calmly and lucidly. Her </p><p>mind toyed with pleasant externals and </p><p>refused to consider primitive facts. </p><p> The Apache Kid, Hardy, the fire, were</p><p>now vague memories falling back into the </p><p>shadows of obscurity before the irresistible </p><p>advance of love and hope. </p><p>SHE was in the Springtime of youth, </p><p>the day was matchless, and her </p><p>powerful horse was bearing her </p><p>swiftly to her twin loves. </p><p> Of course the man had never spoken a</p><p>word of love to her, but that did not matter. </p><p>He» might resist for a time, but would </p><p>finally bow as she had bowed to the im- </p><p>mutable law. She smiled as she thought of </p><p>any man attempting to resist the law of </p><p>love—the law that governed the universe. </p><p> She surrendered to tender thoughts of</p><p>Norn. What a restless being he was, ever </p><p>in action. Yet all his deeds sprang from </p><p>his great unselfishness. He had no thought </p><p>of self, no small, bickering egotism, no desire </p><p>to parade his masculinity. He was as </p><p>clean as a pine on the mountain top, and as </p><p>sound and as strong. The love of such a </p><p>man was worth any effort, any sacrifice. </p><p> In time they would come to an intimate</p><p>understanding, with none of the commonal- </p><p>ities and jealousies that marked the average </p><p>love. They would go through life. . . . </p><p> Here she paused in her dreaming and</p><p>laughed at herself. Surely she was taking </p><p>a great deal for granted. She was building </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>59 </p><p>a beautiful air-castle that might fall with a </p><p>crash and bury her heart and its hopes. </p><p> A lean prospector overtook her, but did</p><p>not attempt that bland smirking the average </p><p>male imagines paves the way to woman’s </p><p>favor. He recognized her as the woman </p><p>for whom King Norn had shot the Apache </p><p>Kid. Thus, to him, Norn’s protection </p><p>walked before her, a deadly menacing </p><p>shadow that warned: </p><p> “For this woman I killed the killer of</p><p>twenty. Pause at your peril.” </p><p> The prospector did not pause. He</p><p>circled around her, eyes to the front, and </p><p>passed on, omitting even the conven- </p><p>tional “Howdy ma’am.” </p><p> The girl marveled a little at the man’s</p><p>actions. Heretofore, every man she had </p><p>met on her rides had volunteered much in- </p><p>formation concerning the weather and the </p><p>country, and had favored her with wide, </p><p>bland smiles. </p><p> Presently she discerned a man approach-</p><p>ing. He was belaboring a couple of burros. </p><p>Then, as he saw her, he turned the burro </p><p>from the road, and pretended to be occupied </p><p>with straightening the packs. She recog- </p><p>nized him as the shaggy raconteur who had </p><p>once sought to entertain her on the hotel </p><p>porch. He did not look up as she passed. </p><p>The other prospector had given him a </p><p>hurried account of the passing of the Apache </p><p>Kid. The shaggy one heaved a sigh of re- </p><p>lief as she passed. Not for a panful of </p><p>nuggets would he have accosted her. How- </p><p>ever harmless his greeting, it might be mis- </p><p>construed, and he proposed not to toy with </p><p>chance. </p><p> She met the westbound stage whose</p><p>driver and passengers had been fully posted </p><p>by the lean prospector. The driver touched </p><p>his hat, but the passengers of the coach sat </p><p>tight, and refrained from the usual road </p><p>pleasantries. </p><p> Dora was familiar with the main road,</p><p>but had never ventured to explore the branch </p><p>that led to Norn’s ranch. But she antici- </p><p>pated no difficulty; there was Rain-maker,</p><p>and the ranch lay in the lap of the mountain. </p><p> She turned into the ranch road, confident</p><p>and happy. Dreamily she watched the </p><p>lizards speed through the sandy aisles be- </p><p>tween the greasewood and squat burro </p><p>weed. She smiled at an inquisitive jack- </p><p>rabbit that raised up and stared at her with </p><p>round, foolish eyes, the sunlight redly illumi- </p><p>nating his thin ears. </p><p> The sweep and majesty of the mountain-</p><p>guarded desert intensified the naive sim- </p><p>plicity of thought that now seemed so </p><p>delightful to her. All that cultivated re- </p><p>serve, that chill, aloof attitude of the specta- </p><p>tor, those experiences with strutting mas- </p><p>culine egoes had faded into remoteness. </p><p>She felt the kinship of nature, and her </p><p>childhood called to her with a sweet, insis- </p><p>tent voice. She noted some stones set in </p><p>orderly fashion, by the roadside, and re- </p><p>called the play-houses built of sticks and </p><p>stones in the long ago. She was tempted to </p><p>dismount, and again build a play-house of </p><p>sticks and stones. Love demands natural- </p><p>ness and will have none of the artificial, </p><p>none of the cold wisdom of experience. </p><p>Therefore, children attract love with little </p><p>or no effort, and when grown-ups come </p><p>under its spell they, too, see through the </p><p>eyes of children. </p><p> The girl recalled slipping her hand into</p><p>Norn’s with no regret for her vanished </p><p>pride. It had been a perfectly natural </p><p>move; she would do it again, she sliamelessly </p><p>admitted, if he gave her an opportunity. </p><p> Presently she came to a fork of the ranch</p><p>road that momentarily puzzled her. She </p><p>decided to take the road most plainly </p><p>marked with evidences of recent travel. A </p><p>freight outfit, bound for the mines beyond </p><p>the desert hills, had left broad wagon </p><p>tracks and the thick imprint of many hoofs. </p><p>She rode on, following the broad track of </p><p>the freight wagons. She noted that the </p><p>road veered slightly from the mountain, but </p><p>was confident that it would soon turn </p><p>toward Rain-maker. </p><p> Desert atmosphere and distances are</p><p>deceiving. It now seemed to the girl that </p><p>she was approaching the mountain; in </p><p>reality she was headed for a pass in the </p><p>desert hills between Norn’s ranch and </p><p>Tunnel Canon. She had not the faintest</p><p>conception of the vast proportions of the </p><p>mountain. There it was, apparently direct- </p><p>ly in front of her. She crossed Big Wash </p><p>and rode on steadily toward the pass. </p><p> When a short distance from the mouth of</p><p>Tunnel Canon, she glanced to the left and </p><p>glimpsed the buildings and the trees of the </p><p>Norn ranch. She was about to turn from </p><p>the road when she discerned a number of </p><p>riders approaching from the direction of </p><p>tiie great wash she had crossed. They were </p><p>not riding in a compact group, but were </p><p>spread out in a long line whose left flank </p><p>6o </p><p>Adventure </p><p>intervened between her and the ranch. </p><p>Some intuitive sense of danger prompted </p><p>her to turn toward the mouth of Tunnel </p><p>Canon. </p><p> Immediately, the riders changed their</p><p>course, proving to her that she was the </p><p>quarry they were seeking. The panic of </p><p>the hunted overwhelmed her, and she </p><p>galloped recklessly to the foot of the ridge </p><p>whose eroded and crumbling side formed </p><p>the far wall of the canon. A fearful back- </p><p>ward glance convinced her that they were </p><p>closing in on her. Frantically she urged her </p><p>horse up the slope of the ridge. Then, as </p><p>she again glanced back, she glimpsed a </p><p>spotted horse. She pulled in abruptly and </p><p>laughed weakly. How foolish she had </p><p>been to give way to such an unreasonable </p><p>panic. Norn always rode a spotted horse, </p><p>and here he was with his cowboys, trying to </p><p>overtake her and give her safe conduct to </p><p>his ranch. </p><p> But was it Norn? Something unfamiliar</p><p>in the riding of the man on the pinto checked </p><p>the natural impulse to ride down the slope </p><p>to meet them. The rider on the spotted </p><p>horse lacked Norn’s easy grace and daring. </p><p>She saw him ride around boulders over </p><p>which the other riders leaped their horses. </p><p> Suddenly two riders broke from the ad-</p><p>vancing line and raced into the mouth of the </p><p>canon. The other riders swung to the </p><p>right to intercept her, should she attempt </p><p>to dash into the adjoining canon. These </p><p>were plainly hostile tactics. Surely Norn </p><p>would not order his men to surround her, </p><p>simply to guide her to the ranch. </p><p> She looked about her desperately, and</p><p>then sent her horse into a plunging gallop </p><p>up the ridge. The crack of a rifle slapped </p><p>the silence of the canon, and the whine of a </p><p>warning bullet made her gasp and abruptly </p><p>halt. She could hear the shouts and curses </p><p>of her pursuers as they struck the foot of the </p><p>ridge. She was trapped. </p><p>CHAPTER XII </p><p> AS THE pinto carried him into the</p><p>desert, the gambler groped through </p><p>a mental fog for some plan that, if</p><p>properly set in action, would remove King </p><p>Norn from the world, and leave Chance </p><p>Hardy free to follow his desires. But, in- </p><p>variably, every thoughr-trail led back to tht </p><p>one impregnable fact, the killing of the </p><p>Apache Kid and the method thereof. </p><p>Norn’s use of Sunshine as a diversion from </p><p>the main attack proved him a thinker; and </p><p>the gambler, primitive, led by emotions, </p><p>dealing only with ignorant men, inwardly </p><p>cringed at the thought of meeting a gun- </p><p>master who possessed not only a superior </p><p>body, but a mind to plan, to peer into the </p><p>future, to make deductions. And that </p><p>meeting, if he remained in the Hemper </p><p>territory, was inevitable. </p><p> For hours, he bitterly recalled, he had</p><p>watched the Kid, hungering for the gun- </p><p>fighter’s life. Many times, with compara- </p><p>tive safety, he might have emptied the shot- </p><p>gun into the killer’s body, but had been </p><p>held back by a nameless dread. Enter </p><p>then King Norn, the thinker, to destroy the </p><p>Kid with a little plan. At that inevitable </p><p>meeting might not the thinker once more </p><p>put forth a little plan of which the kernel </p><p>thereof was death for Chance Hardy? </p><p> And back of it all was the woman. What</p><p>a thick-headed fool he had been not to see </p><p>that King Norn had been his principal rival </p><p>from the day of the girl’s arrival in Hemper. </p><p>Inwardly he writhed as he realised how </p><p>Norn had permitted him to clear away the </p><p>human trash around the woman. Norn </p><p>had watched him intimidate the little </p><p>preacher, the doctor, the men who shrank </p><p>back from danger, the weaklings, and the </p><p>riff-raff of the town. </p><p> Men like Bundy and Brown, requiring</p><p>special treatment, had been honored with </p><p>Norn’s personal attention. The man dealt </p><p>not only in little plans, but in great plans </p><p>made up of many little plans. Even the </p><p>killing of Billy Snake was a plan that </p><p>warned all men that those who rested in the </p><p>shadow of King Norn’s friendship held the </p><p>right to call on his heart’s blood for their </p><p>protection. </p><p> And back of it all was the woman. The</p><p>gambler possessed the imagination that is </p><p>rooted in emotion and desire, and he vis- </p><p>ioned her warm, glowing beauty. But </p><p>before her rose an ominous figure, alert,</p><p>terrible, and with an eye reflecting lightning </p><p>thought. </p><p> “Norn,” he muttered, bending low over</p><p>the saddle horn. “Norn.” </p><p> The woman seats herself in a luxurious</p><p>chair and looks out on the world of men. </p><p>In her face is a maddening, unfathomable </p><p>mystery. An indifferent smile plays about </p><p>her scarlet lips, and in her eyes dwells a lure </p><p>that draws eager fools to their doom. </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>61 </p><p> Bundy, with his drunken leer, swaggers</p><p>up, and the ominous, terrible figure trans- </p><p>forms him into a battered, bloody, cowering </p><p>wretch. Brown, the soft and fat, mouthing </p><p>large words, approaches with airy gallantry </p><p>only to be transformed into a sodden thing </p><p>bawling for water. Other men fall back </p><p>into the shadow. Then the Apache Kid, </p><p>the killer of twenty, presses forward, and, </p><p>in a flash, becomes an inert piece of clay. </p><p>And then many men fall back into the </p><p>shadow. Now another presses forward— </p><p>Chance Hardy. </p><p> The ominous, terrible figure seems to pro-</p><p>ject from his eyes two fine wires that con- </p><p>verge in the heart of Chance Hardy. The </p><p>guns flash, and two bullets follow the fine </p><p>wires into the heart. It is finished. The </p><p>ominous, terrible figure turns and extends a </p><p>hand to the girl. - She rises and gives him a </p><p>smile of sweet surrender, and slowly they </p><p>fade, fade, fade. </p><p> The gambler cursed and jerked himself</p><p>back into reality. He now plainly saw that </p><p>there was only one course left for him to </p><p>follow, and that led to Pete and his men, </p><p>under whose protection a campaign against </p><p>the rancher might be safely planned. </p><p>Norn’s actions indicated that he had either </p><p>foiled an attempt to capture the boy, </p><p>or knew that the gang now held the </p><p>lad. </p><p> Norn, doubtless, was trailing him now, for</p><p>the rancher was conceded to be a wizard </p><p>in the desert. Hardy hauled the heavy </p><p>rifle from its scabbard, pulled in the pinto, </p><p>and listened. Suddenly he noted an omi- </p><p>nous glare in the sky over Hemper. Fire. </p><p>The town was burning. His saloon would </p><p>be destroyed. The old safe would probably </p><p>be looted as soon as it cooled. </p><p> The glare increased in intensity and</p><p>mounted higher. The gambler groaned. </p><p>The town was doomed. </p><p>_ Then he realized that he was wasting </p><p>time. Norn would not let the burning of </p><p>Hemper swerve him from his course. The </p><p>rancher knew the desert intimately, every </p><p>trail, every cut-off, every water-hole. No, </p><p>he must not think of returning to town;</p><p>Norn would surely ambush him. </p><p> Though the gambler was a town man, he</p><p>was familiar with the camps of the gang. </p><p>He knew that Twenty-eight Palms was </p><p>closer to the Norn ranch than the Witch- </p><p>talk camp, and that the gang would, in all </p><p>probability, choose the former camp for </p><p>their headquarters while lurking about the </p><p>Norn ranch. </p><p> He followed the ranch road until the loom</p><p>of Rain-maker warned him that he was </p><p>nearing the north side of the basin. Turn- </p><p>ing from the road, he cut across country. </p><p>Progress now was slow. His had been a </p><p>soft life, and he found it difficult to hold his </p><p>courage in that gray waste. He entered </p><p>Big Wash, and was forced to ride far to the </p><p>south before he could find an exit from the </p><p>great, sunken way. The sun was above the </p><p>horizon before he glimpsed Twenty-eight </p><p>Palms. </p><p> Pete snatched up a pair of battered field-</p><p>glasses. </p><p> “Holy smoke,” he ejaculated, “it's Hardy</p><p>ridin’ Norn’s painted hawse!” </p><p> Hardy, as he approached the camp, de-</p><p>cided to withhold nothing from the gang. </p><p>He was riding Norn’s horse and they would </p><p>demand an explanation. He woidd put </p><p>them on the defensive, convince them their </p><p>safety lay in unity. </p><p> As he dismounted beneath the palms the</p><p>rovers gathered about him. </p><p> “You didn’t get the boy, I see,” observed</p><p>the gambler, with a dark glance at Pete. </p><p> “Not yet,” that worthy returned optim-</p><p>istically, “but we’ll pick him up in a day or </p><p>two. But what you doin’ with Norn’s </p><p>hawse?” </p><p> “Norn killed the Apache Kid in my place</p><p>last night. The Kid took a ring from Miss </p><p>Wayne, and Norn come in and put up a </p><p>play against Sunshine, and then beefed the </p><p>Kid. Then he throws his guns on me, and </p><p>cleans me, and then takes me over to the </p><p>hotel. There I broke away, jumped his </p><p>pinto, and here I be. You bungled the</p><p>deal somewhere, Pete. Norn must know </p><p>we’re after the boy.” </p><p> But Pete and his men were not impressed</p><p>by the accusation with which Hardy finished </p><p>his account. They considered only the red </p><p>fact of Norn having killed the Apache Kid. </p><p>Hardy’s importance, his power, his ability </p><p>to reward shrank to proportions pitifully </p><p>small and insignificant. </p><p> Pete, the far-sighted, voiced the general</p><p>sentiment when he grumbled: </p><p> “You sure have fixed your own funeral.</p><p>Paws off for me, if Norn’s on your trail.” </p><p>Then with a calculating look. “Bring any </p><p>money with you?” </p><p> “Why, no,” faltered Hardy. “How</p><p>could I?” </p><p>62 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “That’s right,” mused Pete dryly. “You</p><p>couldn’t gather it on the run.” </p><p>THE gambler flushed darkly at the </p><p>insult, and forced a smile that failed </p><p>to deceive even the dullest of the </p><p>rovers. </p><p> Pete hooked his thumbs in his belt and</p><p>insolently looked the gambler up and down. </p><p> “Now that we’ve bungled the game, as</p><p>you say, what’s your next move? If Norn </p><p>knows we’re after the boy, he hain’t likely </p><p>to leave him hangin’ on a tree for us. The </p><p>chances are he took him to town with him, </p><p>and got him hid away safe. And by this </p><p>time he’s in the desert with a bunch of </p><p>men.” </p><p> “No, I don’t think that,” Hardy soothed.</p><p>“I looked back and the sky was all lit up. </p><p>Looked like the town was burnin’. If it </p><p>was, Norn couldn’t get men to leave-” </p><p> “Well, then,” Pete cut in quickly, “that</p><p>means your place is gone. You won’t be in </p><p>shape to deliver the money.” </p><p> “Oh, yes, I will,” the gambler hastily</p><p>assured him. “I’ve got it in a Los Angeles </p><p>bank.” </p><p> “That’s what you say,” muttered Pete;</p><p>and drew back to confer with his men. </p><p> The gambler shivered inwardly as he</p><p>noted that he was debarred from the </p><p>council. They were treating him as they </p><p>would an outsider. </p><p> Presently Pete returned.</p><p> “The boys don’t jes’ like this deal as it</p><p>stands now,” he said slowly. “At the </p><p>start they was willin’ to take your word, but </p><p>now they want to see the color of your </p><p>money before they go ahead. They’re </p><p>thinkin’ of old man Norn and the old bunch </p><p>he wiped out. They was willin’ enough to </p><p>pick up the boy and hold him for you, but </p><p>they don’t want open war with King Norn. </p><p>If you want any kind of action now, you’d </p><p>better slip into town and drag back some </p><p>dinero. The sight of real money might stir</p><p>the boys up a little.” </p><p> In Pete’s attitude was a thinly-veiled</p><p>insolence. Hardy, to the raw-boned desert </p><p>rover, was now “a has-been” who had </p><p>taken cover like a coyote. Pete knew that </p><p>money alone could not hold a man erect in </p><p>t lie desert country; to survive, he must have </p><p>the power to chill the hearts of men with </p><p>fear. Removed from his saloon, with its </p><p>glittering display of bottles, its roulette- </p><p>wheel and faro lay-out, the gambler seemed </p><p>an insignificant man. Certainly, with his </p><p>white hands and soft body, he was unfit to </p><p>cope with the bronzed, lean desert rovers. </p><p>He had ruled them, Pete now saw, through </p><p>their desires, and not through any natural </p><p>strength of character. Whisky and gam- </p><p>bling had been the sources of his power. </p><p>He had done nothing, suffered no hardships, </p><p>yet he had used them to gather money for </p><p>him. They had been the peons and he_the </p><p>lordly Don. </p><p> The dominant qualities that Pete,</p><p>thcough policy, had held under cover now </p><p>sprang up, virile, hard, and not to be de- </p><p>nied. Contemptuously he regarded the </p><p>man who had once ruled him, sneering a lit- </p><p>tle at the fine boots, the white vest, and the </p><p>dazzling watch-chain. A few days in the </p><p>desert, and the fine boots would be in tat- </p><p>ters, the white vest soiled and greasy, and </p><p>the smooth hands blistered and sore. </p><p> Lower and yet lower sank the gambler in</p><p>Pete’s estimation. By long rides, by sweat </p><p>and toil, he, and his sort, had kept Hardy's </p><p>hands white, and had made it possible for </p><p>him to wear fine clothes and sport dazzling </p><p>watch-chains. </p><p> Even now Hardy was attempting to use</p><p>him to secure a woman. Why serve him </p><p>further? Since Norn had stripped the </p><p>mask from his face, the card-sharp was not </p><p>tp be feared. </p><p> Hardy, in a desperate effort to regain his</p><p>prestige, sought to address the gang, but </p><p>Pete viciously checked him. </p><p> “Don’t start no talk with the bunch,”</p><p>warned the lean leader, the muscles around </p><p>his eyes twitching. “If you got anything to </p><p>say, say it to me.” </p><p> Curbing his rage as best he could, the</p><p>gambler forced himself to speak in regretful </p><p>tones. </p><p> “Pete, I’ve been on the square. I’ve</p><p>told you all. I might have come out here </p><p>and kept a lot of stuff under cover, but I laid </p><p>every card on the table. Do you think that </p><p>is the way to treat a man who plays a square </p><p>game with you? You agreed to get the </p><p>boy, take so much money and ask no ques- </p><p>tions. I didn’t think, and I don’t think </p><p>now, that you or any of the boys would </p><p>kick out on the given word.” </p><p> The little earnest speech impressed the</p><p>gang. Even Pete was moved by it. </p><p> “I could have said,” Hardy went on,</p><p>“that Norn loaned me his pinto, but J </p><p>didn’t; I told you the facts. He got the </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>63 </p><p>drop on me, but that don't mean he is goin’ </p><p>to run me out of this country.” </p><p> Suddenly he turned to the gang.</p><p> “Is there a man among you that ever</p><p>come to me for a dollar or any kind of help </p><p>and didn’t get it?” </p><p> The answer was a chorus of negative</p><p>grunts. </p><p> Then to Pete:</p><p> “Let’s get the boy now. He’s the high</p><p>card. When you hold him, Norn can’t </p><p>do a thing.” </p><p> “Why can’t he?” Pete sharply ques-</p><p>tioned. “What’s to hinder him?" </p><p> “He wouldn’t want the kid hurt,” the</p><p>gambler said smoothly. </p><p> “Maybe so,” Pete grumbled doubtfully;</p><p>and squinted up at the sun. </p><p> “We’d better be movin’,” Hardy meekly</p><p>suggested. “It’s toward noon now.” </p><p> But Pete took his own time in getting the</p><p>gang on the trail. There were the horses to </p><p>bring in and water, and Pete found that he </p><p>had to mend his saddle before he could </p><p>proceed. </p><p> Hardy inwardly fretted and fumed, but</p><p>made no effort to hurry the men. His posi- </p><p>tion was too precarious for any display of </p><p>dictatorialness. </p><p> It was an hour past noon before they</p><p>mounted and rode slowly toward the Norn </p><p>ranch. </p><p> “We’ll go over and have a look around,”</p><p>Pete hedged. “Maybe Pedro will have </p><p>something to tell us. I sent him into Norn’s </p><p>canon.” </p><p> “Where’s Bundy?” Hardy suddenly</p><p>queried. </p><p> “Watchin’ Big Wash near the camp,”</p><p>Pete replied indifferently. ‘ ‘That gives him</p><p>somethin’ to do, and he’s not in the way.” </p><p> The gambler made no comment, though</p><p>a vague suspicion regarding Bundy’s mo- </p><p>tive in consenting to remain near the Witch- </p><p>talk camp flitted through his mind. </p><p>NORN, in the meantime, had </p><p>joined his men at the foot of Witch- </p><p>talk, and had struck Dickie’s trail </p><p>leading from the camp. </p><p> The tracks of the shod pony were not</p><p>difficult to follow and they soon came to the </p><p>canon into which Bundy had led the boy. </p><p> Norn discovered the dead rattler in the</p><p>little camp at the head of the canon, and </p><p>carefully inspected the body of the snake </p><p>and the tracks around it. </p><p> “Looks like it had been shot and then</p><p>trampled,” he muttered. “A man doesn’t </p><p>trample a big snake unless it has bitten </p><p>him.” </p><p> Closely he exmained the boy’s tracks</p><p>and the impression of the lad’s body in the </p><p>sand. At 110 time had the snake been </p><p>within striking distance of the boy. </p><p> “I think the man was bitten,” the</p><p>rancher concluded, as he straightened up. </p><p>“If he’s carrying venom, his trail will be </p><p>short.” </p><p> Norn led the way out of the canon and up</p><p>the slope of the main ridge of the desert </p><p>range. There, just before they struck hard </p><p>and rocky ground, they discovered that the </p><p>man had dismounted and leaned against his </p><p>horse. </p><p> “This surely indicates that something is</p><p>wrong,” Norn reasoned, as he traced out </p><p>the tracks with his forefinger. “The tracks </p><p>are far apart and he evidently threw his </p><p>whole weight on his heels. He’s either sick </p><p>or carrying snake venom.” </p><p> They rode up to the crest of the ridge, but</p><p>the ground, hard as flint, gave up no trail- </p><p>signs. </p><p> Norn decided to send his men south to</p><p>the nearest water-hole. </p><p> “If you strike his trail at the water-</p><p>hole, stick to it,” he ordered. “But in case </p><p>you don’t, drift back to the ranch by cir- </p><p>cling to the north. I’ll cover the country </p><p>back to Rain-maker.” </p><p> The rancher rode slowly north, dismount-</p><p>ing at times to closely scrutinize the ground. </p><p>In a few hours his patience was rewarded. </p><p>He discovered the faint impression of a </p><p>horseshoe. He walked in ever-widening </p><p>circles until he struck the trail leading down </p><p>from the ridge into a tributary of Tunnel </p><p>Canon. </p><p> The trail now was as plain as a wa-</p><p>gon road. The little sandy places be- </p><p>tween the boulders were as wax to hold the </p><p>imprints of hoof and foot. </p><p> When he came into the main canon, he</p><p>found a group of tracks indicating a halt. </p><p>Apparently the boy, now in the lead, had </p><p>dismounted and returned to the man. The </p><p>man was surely sick or hurt, for the tracks </p><p>of the boy indicated that he had attempted </p><p>to move the man. They were evidently </p><p>headed for the ranch. With the horse fol- </p><p>lowing him like a dog, the rancher stole </p><p>down the canon, alert, watchful, rifle at the </p><p>ready. </p><p>m </p><p>64 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>pf!H) PETE was the first to sight the </p><p>gg woman. Hardy noticed his excite- </p><p>ment, and then a man back of them </p><p>called out— </p><p> “That looks like a woman ridin’ a light</p><p>hawse.” </p><p> “Where’s your field-glasses?” the gambler</p><p>yelled at Pete, forgetful of Norn, the boy </p><p>and lost prestige. </p><p> Pete signaled “halt” to the men, and,</p><p>with a curious side-glance at Hardy, pro- </p><p>duced the field-glasses. Hardy frantically </p><p>grabbed for the glasses, but Pete swung </p><p>them out of his reach. </p><p> “Don’t be in such a rush,” he coldly ad-</p><p>vised; and gave the gambler such a malevo- </p><p>lent glance that the latter recoiled as from a </p><p>sudden lick of flame. </p><p> What Pete saw through the glasses trans-</p><p>formed the habitual hard, set expression of </p><p>his face into one of bland and eager interest. </p><p>He even smiled reminiscently. </p><p> “It’s her,” he said softly, as he lowered</p><p>the glasses. “Uncle Charlie’s niece.” </p><p> As he gave the glasses to Hardy, and</p><p>noted the gambler’s eagerness, Pete’s face </p><p>resumed its old set expression, though a </p><p>slight twitching of the corners of his hard </p><p>mouth betrayed some violent inner </p><p>agitation. </p><p> The magic glasses brought the girl full</p><p>into the gambler’s vision. Long he gazed, </p><p>while the horses moved restlessly, and the </p><p>men muttered vague comments and glanced </p><p>at one another furtively. </p><p> “Yes; it’s her,” Hardy exulted, reluctant-</p><p>ly returning the glasses to Pete. </p><p> Pete slowly replaced the glasses in the</p><p>worn case. </p><p> “I don’t reckon—” he raised the flap of</p><p>the saddle-bag and dropped the glasses into </p><p>the leather pocket—“we need bother—” </p><p>his fingers fumbled the buckle— “about the </p><p>boy now.”</p><p> Irritated at Pete’s slothfulness and ap-</p><p>parent waning interest in the whole affair, </p><p>the gambler burst out impatiently. </p><p> “Sure, the boy dcjn’t count now. Come</p><p>on, you’ll get your money just the same.” </p><p> He started to urge the pinto forward, but</p><p>Pete raised a detaining hand. </p><p> “Hold on; don’t be in such a rush.</p><p>Let’s talk business.” </p><p> “But she’s gettin’ away from us,” ex-</p><p>postulated Hardy. “We’re losin’ time. </p><p>What do you mean by ‘business’?” </p><p> Pete glanced back at the gang and smiled</p><p>grimly. Then he made a suggestive move- </p><p>ment with his thumb and forefinger, the </p><p>money sign. </p><p> “What do you want?” snapped the</p><p>gambler. </p><p> “You keep your money in a Los Angeles</p><p>bank,” Pete quietly replied. “I want your </p><p>check for twenty thousand dollars. I’ll </p><p>make the divvy among the boys. Got a </p><p>pencil?” </p><p> For a moment Hardy considered the new</p><p>proposition. Twenty thousand dollars was </p><p>a lot of money, but small change compared </p><p>to the wealth of Dora Wayne. And there </p><p>was the irresistible magnet of her beauty. </p><p>Also, in the event that Pete attempted any </p><p>crookedness, he could stop payment on the </p><p>check. </p><p> Hastily he filled in the check, and passed</p><p>the slip of paper to Pete who immediately </p><p>passed it back to the gang for inspection </p><p>and approval. </p><p> “Tain’t like real money,” complained the</p><p>hook-nosed man, as he returned the check to </p><p>Pete, “but, if you say it’s O. K., that’s good </p><p>enough for me. You’ll get the coin and </p><p>divvy, will you?” </p><p> “That’s the idee exactly,” Pete assured</p><p>him. “We get the coin and Chance gets the </p><p>girl. Come on.” </p><p> They spurred their horses into a gallop</p><p>and plunged down the bank of Big Wash, </p><p>some of them tobogganing their horses down </p><p>the steep declivity. On the hard floor of </p><p>the wash they raced northward like jockeys </p><p>leaving the post. </p><p> Pete contemplated no involved plot to</p><p>secure the girl for himself. He would pick </p><p>a quarrel with Hardy, after the girl was </p><p>captured, kill him, and thus prove to the </p><p>gang that his will was not to be disputed. </p><p>There were various channels through which </p><p>the check might be cashed, and Hardy </p><p>would not be alive to stop payment. To </p><p>bind the rovers closer to him, he would </p><p>divide his share of the money among them. </p><p> Hardy’s only thought now was to sccure</p><p>the girl. Norn was a vague memory. The </p><p>beauty of the woman called to him with in- </p><p>sistent sweetness. This was the hour for </p><p>which h'e had yearned, for which he had </p><p>plotted through gray days and black nights. </p><p>She would soon be his to have and to </p><p>hold. </p><p> As they dashed from the cover of the</p><p>wash, Hardy shouted with an odd wild </p><p>anxiety. </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>65 </p><p> “I don’t want her hurt, Pete. Under-</p><p>stand? She mustn’t be hurt. Handle her </p><p>easy.” </p><p> The gambler saw Pete’s lips move, but</p><p>caught only a faint mumble above the </p><p>thump of hoofs and the crackle of brush. </p><p> Pete’s reply, had the gambler heard it,</p><p>might have aroused his suspicions by its </p><p>cryptic accentuations. </p><p> “Don’t you worry. She won’t be hurt.”</p><p>THEY saw the girl urge her horse </p><p>up the ridge, and at this point Pete </p><p>detached the two riders who raced </p><p>forward into the canon to halt the fleeing </p><p>woman with warning shots. Then they </p><p>obliqued and swept up to the foot of the </p><p>ridge. </p><p> At the first warning shot they pulled in.</p><p> “Come on,” yelled Hardy. “She’s</p><p>stopped. Come on. Don’t you see they’ve </p><p>stopped her?” </p><p> Two more shots in quick succession made</p><p>Pete frown puzzledly, and Hardy curse </p><p>wildly. </p><p> Then the gang roared its surprise as the</p><p>girl whirled her horse and plunged down the </p><p>slide of gravel and boulders that formed the </p><p>wall of the canon. As she disappeared, </p><p>Pete turned his horse and galloped toward </p><p>the mouth of the canon. Hardy and the </p><p>gang straggled after him. </p><p> Pete pulled his horse back on its haunches</p><p>as one of the detached riders broke from the </p><p>mouth of the canon. The man was swaying </p><p>drunkenly and would have fallen from the </p><p>saddle but for Pete’s steadying hand. </p><p> “Somebody—one man—got poor Abe,”</p><p>coughed the rider, “and took the girl in the </p><p>tunnel. Got me through the lungs.” </p><p> His breath came in short whistles and</p><p>blood welled from his mouth. </p><p> The gang came up and two men eased the</p><p>wounded man to the ground.</p><p> “Somebody got Abe and done up Bill</p><p>there,” Pete snarled, to rouse the blood </p><p>lust of the gang. “Whoever he is, he’s in </p><p>the tunnel with the girl. Shall we throw </p><p>down our hands now and let him have her?” </p><p> “No,” came the roaring chorus, “get liim</p><p>—get him!” </p><p> “Everybody take cover,” ordered Pete,</p><p>dismounting and jerking his saddle-gun </p><p>from the scabbard. “We’ll creep up and </p><p>have a look at the hole of that lone wolf.” </p><p> A man placed a canteen of water within</p><p>reach of the wounded Bill. They crept </p><p>forward, from boulder to boulder, from </p><p>bush to bush, until they came to a smooth </p><p>barren stretch of sand on which lay the </p><p>crumpled body of the luckless Abe. Be- </p><p>yond die dead man stood his horse facing </p><p>two horses not far from the black slot they </p><p>knew to be the tunnel’s mouth. </p><p> Cautiously Pete raised up, his sharp eyes</p><p>searching for some coign of vantage from </p><p>which lead could be sent straight into the </p><p>tunnel. But the outlook for a long-dis- </p><p>tance attack was most discouraging. </p><p> Facing the tunnel was a long smooth</p><p>barren slope offering no shelter. At the </p><p>first visible bend in the canon rose a jagged </p><p>mass of quartz. This offered shelter, but </p><p>the lead would thud harmlessly against </p><p>the wall of the tunnel which had been driven </p><p>into another upheaval of a mighty ledge </p><p>that diagonaled across the canon beneath </p><p>the sand)' floor. </p><p> “There’s no use to figger on settin’ back</p><p>and smokin’ ’em out,” Hardy remon- </p><p>strated feverishly. “Somebody might come </p><p>along and carry word to Hemper, and Norn </p><p>might come in on us from the south. Day- </p><p>light’s goin’, too. I tell you, we got "to </p><p>rush ’em and wind it up quick.” </p><p> “If you’re in such a hurry, be you ready</p><p>to take the lead?” </p><p> Pete’s sneering query held a cold</p><p>challenge. </p><p> Hardy was silent. The lean desert</p><p>rover gave him a contemptuous glance, and</p><p>clicked- </p><p> “All right; we’ll rush ’em.”</p><p> Pete drew his men back and proceeded to</p><p>give them the plan of attack. </p><p> “First, we’ll Injun file until we- come to</p><p>the wall of rock. Then we’ll bunch up and </p><p>rush the mouth of the tunnel. The girl will </p><p>be in the cross-cut and the man will prob’ly </p><p>be flat again the near wall. We must try </p><p>and not get in each other’s way. I thought </p><p>of callin’ to him to give up, but don’t think </p><p>that would be much use. He got poor Abe </p><p>and old Bill is about done for, and he </p><p>prob’ly reckons on stayin’ to the finish.” </p><p>“Why not divide and rush both sides,” </p><p>Hard)’ suggested. </p><p> “That would mean too much of a mix-up</p><p>at the mouth o’ the tunnel,” Pete objected. </p><p>“No; we’ll rush ’em from this side.” </p><p> “I don’t like tiie looks o’ this,” whined</p><p>the hook-nosed man. “That feller in the </p><p>tunnel is a bad hombre. He got two of us; </p><p>he may get some more.” </p><p>66 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Pete’s lip curled back over his teeth, and</p><p>he forced himself into an .awe-inspiring </p><p>rage. </p><p> Upon the hook-nosed man he heaped</p><p>every vile epithet known to the border. </p><p> “You limber-jawed, rotten-hearted</p><p>coyote, you lousy son of a squaw,” were </p><p>the mildest of his smoking denunciations. </p><p>“Are you afraid of one man and a bawlin’ </p><p>woman,” he spat forth, as though the words </p><p>burned his lips, “you leavin’s of the scum o’ </p><p>hell?” </p><p> The hook-nosed one seemed to shrink, to</p><p>grow smaller, to wither under the blast of </p><p>sizzling words. He made a vague gesture </p><p>of submission to fate, and Pete suddenly </p><p>turned to the gang, and swept them with his </p><p>verbal fire. </p><p> “If any of you are scared to foller a man,</p><p>go back to your hawses and I’ll take that </p><p>holed-up wolf alone. Who’s the first </p><p>quitter?” </p><p> A savage roar answered him, and, lest</p><p>they lose courage and fail him at the last </p><p>moment, he bawled, “Come on, boys,” and </p><p>ran toward the slope down which Dora's </p><p>horse had plunged. </p><p> For a moment they hesitated and then</p><p>charged after him, growling and cursing, </p><p>working themselves into a blind rage. </p><p>Hardy was the last man to follow, and, as </p><p>Pete reached the wall of rock, he flung a </p><p>baleful glance at the man who took the </p><p>minimum risk. </p><p> They hugged the wall of rock until within</p><p>a few paces of the mouth of the tunnel. At </p><p>a signal from Pete, the file of men coalesced </p><p>into a frenzied, struggling mass that surged </p><p>to and fro for a breath, and then rolled into </p><p>die black mouth of the tunnel. </p><p>CHAPTER XIII </p><p>NORN’S ACTIONS, as he turned </p><p>the bend in the canon and recognized </p><p>Dora, were swift and sure. As the </p><p>leading rider fired the warning shot, Norn </p><p>caught him fairly in the notch of the sight</p><p>and pulled the trigger. A fleeting glimpse </p><p>of a frantic horse kicking free of a dead </p><p>man, and then the second rider in the notch </p><p>of the sight. A quick pressure of the trig- </p><p>ger, and the second rider clawed at his sad- </p><p>dle horn, lost control of his horse, recov- </p><p>ered, and finally turned and galloped in an </p><p>erratic course from the canon. </p><p>Norn ran down the canon, shouting the </p><p>girl's name, and halted a few yards beyond </p><p>the tunnel. </p><p> “It’s Norn,” he called; and beckoned</p><p>imperatively. </p><p> She hesitated to dare the steep slope, and</p><p>then, with a quick intake of breath, whirled </p><p>her horse and urged him down the decliv- </p><p>ity. The animal slid down, almost on his </p><p>haunches, but lost his footing as he struck </p><p>the floor of the canon. Dora sprang free </p><p>of the floundering horse and into the circle </p><p>of Norn’s free arm. </p><p> He half-carried her into the tunnel.</p><p>Scuffing tentatively for rattlesnakes, he </p><p>guided her to the end wall of the left branch </p><p>of the crosscut, and took up a position back </p><p>of the opposite angle. </p><p> “You’re safe in here,” he answered her,</p><p>peering around the angle at the mouth of </p><p>the tunnel. “Whatever comes, do not </p><p>move.” </p><p> “I was so worried about Dickie,” cried</p><p>the girl, forgetful of the danger that threat- </p><p>ened her. “A Mexican came in and told </p><p>the doctor that some one at your ranch had </p><p>been bitten by a rattlesnake. I kept think- </p><p>ing that it might be Dickie-” </p><p> “No harm has come to Dickie,” Norn</p><p>happily interrupted, piecing together the </p><p>evidence he had gathered on the trail. </p><p> The rancher knew that Desert Jack</p><p>would not release tlie Mexican unless </p><p>Dickie had returned to the ranch. The </p><p>man who had taken Dickie into the desert </p><p>hills was playing a lone hand. Bitten by </p><p>the rattler, he had been forced to seek the </p><p>ranch. The boy was safe and unhurt. He </p><p>heaved a sigh of relief. The gang had </p><p>failed to capture the boy. It was now a </p><p>matter of straight fighting.</p><p> Counting Hardy, the gang could not</p><p>muster more than ten men, and he had ac- </p><p>counted for two. Then there was the Mexi- </p><p>can and the man with Dickie. Six men to </p><p>face, and his father had, with the support </p><p>of two cowboys, wiped out a baker’s dozen </p><p>of the old gang. If they attacked the tun- </p><p>nel before dark, he was confident he could </p><p>give them each such a hot reception that the </p><p>survivors would give up the fight. </p><p> If they attempted a night attack, he</p><p>would have much in his favor. Coming in </p><p>from the gray gloom into the pitch-dark </p><p>tunnel, they would, for several vital sec- </p><p>onds, be at a disadvantage. He could prob- </p><p>ably empty the magazine of his repeater </p><p>before it became necessary to leave the </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>67 </p><p>shelter of the angle, and, for the girl’s sake, </p><p>carry the fight to them. </p><p> If they merely besieged the tunnel, he</p><p>would creep out before daylight, and gain </p><p>the shelter of the rocky crest above the </p><p>tunnel. From that point, with the coming </p><p>of daylight, he would make the stakes of </p><p>death so high that his enemies would be </p><p>glad to get out of the game. </p><p> Again he thought of Hardy, and abruptly</p><p>queried— </p><p> “Did you see a man on a spotted horse?”</p><p> “Yes,” she answered, and the rancher</p><p>smiled approval of her calm even tones. “I </p><p>thought at first it was you and was about </p><p>to turn back.” Then, with intense eager- </p><p>ness: “Can’t I do something in case they </p><p>attack us? I can use a revolver.” </p><p> Her gameness forged another link in the</p><p>chain of love. She was no sniveling, whin- </p><p>ing, helpless creature; she was all that his </p><p>heart desired, and somehow, some way he </p><p>would survive and shield her from all harm. </p><p> “You can help me more by keeping out of</p><p>harm’s way,” he said gently. “If they </p><p>come, keep close to the wall and do not </p><p>move. It will soon-” </p><p> Norn never finished that sentence. With</p><p>appalling suddenness the mbuth of the tun- </p><p>nel darkened with struggling men, the </p><p>taller ones bumping their heads against the </p><p>roof. </p><p> The blast from Norn’s rifle in that hole</p><p>in a rock was like the long roar of a titan </p><p>through a great megaphone. The heart- </p><p>shaking bang of six shooters, the zunk of </p><p>lead against the wall, and the rifle’s blast </p><p>reduced the curses, grunts, and groans to a </p><p>hideous monotone. </p><p> Norn’s first shot ripped open the jugular</p><p>vein of a wild rover, and plowed a red fur- </p><p>row across the brows of a man back of him. </p><p>Down went he of the torn jugular, spout- </p><p>ing blood under the heedless heels of the </p><p>gang. The man with the red furrow across </p><p>his brows, whirled and stumbled blindly</p><p>from the tunnel, bawling for help. He fin- </p><p>ally found his horse and fled. </p><p> Norn was now only a few feet from them;</p><p>they had only to rush forward and seize </p><p>him. But the unending blast of his rifle </p><p>was as a fiery wall of death between them </p><p>and their mad desires. </p><p> The leg of the hook-nosed man was shat-</p><p>tered and he fell as though he had inad- </p><p>vertently stepped into a hole. Yet he was </p><p>of a tough breed, and, sprawling, he man- </p><p>aged to raise his six-shooter. Him Norn </p><p>killed; then sent two bullets into Pete, and </p><p>slightly wounded the man next to him. </p><p> The rancher dropped his rifle, drew his</p><p>six-shooter, and leaped into the tunnel. </p><p>The slightly wounded man put a bullet in </p><p>his shoulder, paralyzing the arm. Pete, </p><p>dying on his feet, sent three bullets into </p><p>Norn’s body, breaking a rib, inflicting a </p><p>severe flesh wound in the thigh, and rip- </p><p>ping a long diagonal slash across the chest. </p><p>Norn shot the slightly wounded man in the </p><p>mouth, and that left, alive, Pete and </p><p>Hardy, the latter unscathed. </p><p> The gambler had hugged the side of the</p><p>tunnel close to the mouth, striving to get </p><p>in action the heavy rifle he had found on </p><p>Norn’s saddle. Now the gambler pulled </p><p>the trigger and the bullet grazed the side of </p><p>the rancher’s head. Norn pitched against </p><p>the wall of the tunnel and sank to his </p><p>knees. </p><p> Pete, his vitals torn with lead, turned as</p><p>Hardy fired. Life was now swiftly becom- </p><p>ing a vague, receding thing to Pete. His </p><p>dimming faculties groped for the cause of </p><p>that rifle blast to his ear. Norn—yes, it was </p><p>Norn—was dying. Only Hardy was left, </p><p>and Hardy blocked some insistent desire— </p><p>some all-important attainment. A picture </p><p>of a dark-haired, violet-eyed woman flashed </p><p>before the inner eyes of the rover. The </p><p>ancient primitive desire blazed up—she </p><p>was within his grasp—one more heart- </p><p>wrenching effort and he would be alone— </p><p>with her. Swaying and grinning the death- </p><p>grin, he fired from the hip at the gambler. </p><p>For a breath Hardy stared at him blankly, </p><p>and then suddenly slumped. </p><p> “All down—all down,” mumbled Pete,</p><p>his legs spraddling uncouthly. </p><p> Slowly he turned to look down at Norn.</p><p>THE rancher, clawing, falling, strug- </p><p>gling on the slippery slope of agony, </p><p>fought his way back to conscious- </p><p>ness. He saw two spraddling legs, slanted </p><p>his six-shooter upward and fired. </p><p> Pete received the shot in the abdomen.</p><p>He turned casually enough, and with little, </p><p>slow steps walked from the tunnel. Draw- </p><p>ing on some desert-fed source of vitality, he </p><p>strolled to the center of the canon, and </p><p>paused as if to meditate on the mysteries </p><p>of nature. Then suddenly he collapsed and </p><p>pitched forward on his face. </p><p> Norn was now crawling from the mouth</p><p>68 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>of the tunnel. His arm gave way under him </p><p>and he moaned faintly— </p><p> “Dora, Dora.”</p><p> His thought was for her safety, not for</p><p>the aid she might give him. </p><p> For ages, it seemed to him, he fought</p><p>againrft shadow}' fiends intent on pulling </p><p>him down into oblivion. Inch by inch he </p><p>raised himself to his knees, and, swaying, </p><p>turned slowly toward the tunnel. For a </p><p>moment he stared at the litter of dead men, </p><p>and then toppled forward. </p><p> Silence. An inquisitive lizard appeared</p><p>on a rock near the mouth of the tunnel and </p><p>cocked his head and blinked at the still </p><p>forms. </p><p> The girl, numb with dread, removed her</p><p>hands from her ears. In the silence, Hope </p><p>cowered in the dust. </p><p> Prayer had been her only resource in</p><p>those terrible crashing moments, and now </p><p>she sought its sustaining strength. But the </p><p>silence mocked her, flouted her prayers, and </p><p>sneered at her fainting soul— </p><p> “He .is dead, and all your prayers can</p><p>not bring him back from the land of </p><p>shadow.” </p><p> In sudden, wild desperation she crept to</p><p>the angle of the crosscut and peered down </p><p>the tunnel. The rays from the setting sun </p><p>slanted into the tunnel, bringing out the </p><p>dead faces with photographic clearness. </p><p>Those once virile creatures, throbbing with </p><p>life, were now as fallen trees in the wake of </p><p>a cyclone—still forms, deathly silence. </p><p>And Norn, the restless, the daring, the re- </p><p>sourceful, had fallen. Only she remained. </p><p>That she might mount her horse and ride </p><p>quietly home, the man had died. Freely </p><p>he had offered up his body to ghastly </p><p>wounds that no desecrating hand might </p><p>touch her. </p><p> A faint moan quickened hope to panting</p><p>life. Perhaps—perhaps he had survived. </p><p>She ventured past the angle, but, when she </p><p>came to the dead men, her soul sickened at</p><p>the sordidness of death, its flat and flaccid </p><p>sameness. </p><p> When she reached Norn’s side, he had</p><p>fought his way back to full consciousness. </p><p>Immediately his mind began grappling </p><p>with the situation. The nerves telegraphed </p><p>his brain that he was badly hurt, and he be- </p><p>gan to individualize his wounds. With her </p><p>assistance, he raised himself to a sitting </p><p>posture, and attempted to take stock of his </p><p>injuries. </p><p> “I’m all right,” he murmured; and then a</p><p>billow of darkness overwhelmed him. </p><p> She eased him back and looked about her</p><p>frantically. What could she do? Blood </p><p>from his wounded head was trickling into </p><p>his ear, blood was welling from his shoulder </p><p>and chest, and from l\is side and from Ms </p><p>thigh. </p><p> “What shall I do—what shall I do!” she</p><p>wailed. </p><p> Norn’s lips were moving. She bent down</p><p>to catch the whispered words. </p><p> “Get water—canteen—go ranch—quick</p><p>—wagon—Jack.” </p><p> “But you’ll die wMle I’m gone,” she</p><p>sobbed. “I can not leave you.” </p><p> She saw his face set, saw him summon</p><p>his reserve of strength, saw Ms lips form </p><p>the words— </p><p> “I will live.”</p><p> She glanced up at his horse standing near</p><p>the bend in the canon and ran to secure </p><p>the canteen hanging from the saddle </p><p>horn. </p><p> The water revived Norn wonderfully.</p><p>He managed to murmur something con- </p><p>cerning bandages. She drew off her under- </p><p>skirt, tore it into strips, and, working fran- </p><p>tically, managed to bind up his wounds. </p><p>Her surgical knowledge was limited, and </p><p>the bandages were very crude and clumsy, </p><p>but helped to stanch the flow of blood. </p><p>When the last knot was tied, she paused </p><p>for a breath, and then bent down and kissed </p><p>him. He felt the pressure of her lips and </p><p>his soul set itself for the grim, unending</p><p>struggle. He must not give up—he must </p><p>fight, fight, fight. </p><p> Her horse, not being gun-shy, was crop-</p><p>ping bunch grass not far away. She </p><p>mounted "and rode at top speed toward the </p><p>ranch, heedless of bush and boulder. </p><p> Her whole mind was now concentrated</p><p>on speed, and the deep-lunged desert-bred </p><p>horse responded nobly. He carried her </p><p>across the open desert, dodging the cholla </p><p>and barrel cactus, and finally struck Big </p><p>Wash just below the stream-fed willows. </p><p>Up the far bank he plunged, slipped, strug- </p><p>gled, somehow gained the top, and sped up </p><p>the long slope to the ranch-house. </p><p> Desert Jack appeared in the bunk-house</p><p>door and she called to him wildly. Dickie </p><p>came running from the house squealing his </p><p>delight. But the boy was of secondary im- </p><p>portance now. </p><p> “Norn is badly wounded,” she gasped to</p><p>The Survivor </p><p>69 </p><p>the foreman. “I left him near an old tun- </p><p>nel. He was unable to move.” </p><p> Desert Jack whirled and returned to the</p><p>bunk-house at top speed. </p><p> “Get your stuff,” he bawled at the doc-</p><p>tor who was bending over the mumbling </p><p>Bundy. “Norn’s badly shot up at the old </p><p>tunnel.” </p><p> The foreman lumbered toward the stables</p><p>in an awkward gallop to develop a magical </p><p>speed in harness-handling. He did not for- </p><p>get to snatch a lantern from a peg on the </p><p>stable wall, for he knew that it would be </p><p>dark before they could reach the tunnel. </p><p>Nor did he overlook his big, canvas-cov- </p><p>ered canteen. </p><p> Dr. Cunningham was not a time-waster,</p><p>and threw his satchel and his instrument </p><p>case into the spring wagon just as Jack </p><p>hooked the last tug. </p><p> “I’m going with you,” Dora called.</p><p> “Tell her to stay with the boy, Doc,”</p><p>grumbled Jack. “A woman’s no use no- </p><p>how.” </p><p> “Stay here!” yelled the doctor, as Jack</p><p>sprang into the wagon and the team leaped </p><p>forward. </p><p> “They don’t want you,” said Dickie, with</p><p>a little touch of masculine swagger. “Jack </p><p>says a girl can’t do much anyhow.” </p><p> “He is probably right,” she sighed wear-</p><p>ily, recalling her clumsy efforts to bind up </p><p>Norn’s wounds. </p><p> Bitter against the restrictions and the</p><p>limitations of her sex, she slowly sought the </p><p>porch to watch and to wait. </p><p> The ride to the tunnel was one the doc-</p><p>tor never forgot. Desert Jack stood up the </p><p>greater part of the way. When the wagon </p><p>struck a boulder, the foreman would rise in </p><p>the air, apparently float for a moment, and </p><p>.then return with a leg-numbing clump to </p><p>the wagon. They rode on three wheels, on </p><p>two, on one.</p><p> Desert Jack drew heavily on his vast</p><p>stock of profanity and weird objurgations. </p><p> “Limpin’, weepin,’ bald-headed Moses.</p><p>Move, you mud-footed, hay-burnin’ ham- </p><p>mer-heads, hot ham you, move, I say. By </p><p>the Weedin’ feet of the twelve a-postles, so </p><p>help me Judas H. Priest, did you ever see </p><p>such zim-zam sons of so-forth in all your </p><p>zink-zank zip-zapped days!” </p><p> And at last they clattered into the canon.</p><p>The doctor leaped from the wagon, lantern </p><p>in hand, and ran to Norn’s side. </p><p> The dry, little surgeon’s specialty was</p><p>gunshot wounds. With deft sure move- </p><p>ments, and the eager but clumsy assistance </p><p>of Desert Jack, he scissored away the blood- </p><p>soaked clothing and Dora’s crude bandages. </p><p>RafSS NORN was vaguely conscious that </p><p>some one was working over him, </p><p>that deft hands were applying </p><p>soothing bandages and compresses to his </p><p>wounds. Ages ago soft lips had pressed his, </p><p>heartening his soul to rise dominant and </p><p>supreme above the cringing flesh. Grip- </p><p>ping the slippery edge of the-will-to-live, as </p><p>a man suspended over a chasm grips a </p><p>rocky shelf, he drew strength from the mem- </p><p>ory of that kiss, and, inch by inch, worked </p><p>back to full consciousness. His superb </p><p>vitality, conserved by a life as clean as that </p><p>of some creature of the wild, responded </p><p>quickly to the doctor’s ministrations. </p><p> “Couldn’t kill you with a club,” he heard</p><p>the surgeon say. </p><p> Then, above the pulling, drawing pain</p><p>of his wounds, he felt the sharp stab of the </p><p>hypodermic. </p><p> Again the doctor’s voice as from a great</p><p>distance. </p><p> “Miss Dora got us here in jig time.</p><p>You’re all hunkydory now. We’ll have you </p><p>home in short order.” </p><p> Norn, wanted to speak—to tell them to</p><p>care for any surviving members of the gang, </p><p>but the words would not come. The pain </p><p>became blurred, shadows of drowsiness en- </p><p>compassed him. Nothing mattered now.</p><p> “We’ll load him into the wagon,” the</p><p>doctor planned briskly, “and then have a </p><p>look at the others. I gave him a shot of </p><p>morphia that would put a horse to </p><p>sleep.” </p><p> When they had placed Norn in the wagon,</p><p>Desert Jack led the way to the tunnel, and </p><p>swung the lantern over the dead as the doc- </p><p>tor expertly examined the bodies. </p><p> “Guess this bunch don’t need no nursin’,”</p><p>was Desert Jack’s grim conclusion. Pen- </p><p>sively he added, as though ruminating over </p><p>some pleasant memory: “I was with Dad </p><p>Norn when he cleaned up the old gang. </p><p>This reminds me of it. Things ought to be </p><p>quiet from now on.” </p><p> As they left the tunnel, the callous Jack,</p><p>viewing death as a mere incident, called </p><p>back: </p><p> “Good-by, boys. I’ll see you later.”</p><p> The bodies of Pete and the first rider to</p><p>enter the canon caught Jack’s eye. </p><p>70 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “There’s a couple more,” he lold the doc-</p><p>tor. “Pete and ‘Yuma’ Abe.” </p><p> The doctor made a swift examination of</p><p>the two bodies and shook his head. </p><p> “Come on,” growled Jack. “We’ve</p><p>wasted too much time on these critters al- </p><p>ready.” </p><p> “There might be some more, Jack,” the</p><p>doctor gently reproved. “We wouldn’t </p><p>want to leave a wounded man to suffer.” </p><p> “All right,” grunted the foreman. “I</p><p>s’pose you're right. You chive and I’ll go </p><p>ahead with the lantern, and see if the boy </p><p>collected any more scalps.” </p><p> Jack, holding the lantern above his head,</p><p>zig-zagged to and fro in front of the team </p><p>as they emerged from the mouth of the </p><p>canon. </p><p> “Here’s another one,” he called to the</p><p>doctor who was carefully guiding the team </p><p>around the boulders and' the clumps of </p><p>greasewood. “It’s Bill Sycom.” </p><p> The doctor leaped from the wagon and</p><p>proceeded to snatch Bill back from the </p><p>shadow of death. The rover had pleaded </p><p>in vain for help from the man with the bul- </p><p>let-creased brows. That worthy, intent </p><p>only on saving his own hide, had left his </p><p>comrade to die. Later, that incident re- </p><p>minded Bill that there was no honor among </p><p>thieves and drove him into the peaceful </p><p>trail of honest citizenship. </p><p> In time the rover, his agony eased by the</p><p>hypodermic, was stretched out by Norn’s </p><p>side. </p><p> “No more stops now,” Jack savagely</p><p>proclaimed. “I promised that boy’s daddy </p><p>to always look after him, and, by the livin’ </p><p>lights o’ my mother’s eyes, I’ll do it. Come </p><p>on, now! No more monkeydoodle busi- </p><p>ness!” </p><p> The little doctor made no reply to the</p><p>grizzled foreman’s outburst, but seized the </p><p>reins and clucked to the horses. </p><p> With Desert Jack walking ahead, swing-</p><p>ing the lantern and marking a clear trail, </p><p>then- progress was necessarily slow, but they </p><p>finally reached the ranch without mishap. </p><p> Dora and Dickie were waiting on the</p><p>ranch-house porch, the girl shivering with </p><p>dread, the boy awed into silence by his </p><p>sister’s despair. </p><p> “He’s alive,” shouted the doctor, as he</p><p>pulled in the team near the porch, “and </p><p>he’ll live till he’s a hundred. Get those </p><p>Chinese busy with a couple of beds, Miss </p><p>Dora.” </p><p> “Dickie, you hold the lantern,” bruskly</p><p>ordered Desert Jack, “and make yourself </p><p>useful.” </p><p>DORA, choking with joy, ran to do </p><p>the doctor’s bidding. She drove the </p><p>Chinese servants to distraction with </p><p>wild orders, and was finally forced to pre- </p><p>pare the beds herself. They brought Norn </p><p>in first. Dora flew to his side, but the doc- </p><p>tor’s frown of disapproval made her draw </p><p>back, abashed, fearful that she had unwit- </p><p>tingly broken some all-important medical </p><p>law. </p><p> “Better leave him be,” snapped Desert</p><p>Jack, with brutal frankness. “You can’t </p><p>do him no good.” </p><p> Norn, groping back to reality through the</p><p>opiate fog, saw the girl’s face as though it </p><p>were floating on air. </p><p> “Take her to town,” he moaned faintly.</p><p>Firmly Desert Jack took the girl’s arm </p><p>and led her from the room. She was too </p><p>disconcerted to resist. </p><p> “You’ll find plenty of beds in the house,”</p><p>he said gruffly. “Get some sleep.” </p><p> The old foreman was unreasonable in his</p><p>love for King Norn. He considered the </p><p>girl and her brother responsible for it all </p><p>“If it hadn’t been fer that kid the gal </p><p>would have stayed where she belonged,” he </p><p>muttered. “And, if it hadn’t been fer her, </p><p>they’d a-never cornered King. Dawg-gone </p><p>a hoodoo woman anyhow!” </p><p> When Bill had been placed on the bed in</p><p>the room adjoining Norn’s, and Dickie had</p><p>been sent to liis sister, the doctor turned to </p><p>Jack. </p><p> “You’ll have to go to town tonight for</p><p>help,” lie said, removing his coat and vest, </p><p>and rolling up his shirt sleeves. “I need a </p><p>lot of stuff, too. We’ll give them another </p><p>going-over before you leave. I’ll give you </p><p>a list of what I need. I didn’t anticipate </p><p>three men to look after.” </p><p> “Wonder if I hadn’t better take the gal</p><p>and the kid to town with me,” Jack de- </p><p>bated. </p><p> “Certainly,” snapped the doctor.</p><p>“We’ve enough to look after without both- </p><p>ering with them.” </p><p> Jack stepped into the hall and called to</p><p>the girl, bidding her prepare for a night </p><p>trip to town. Faintly came her assentiye </p><p>answer, and he returned to the bedroom to </p><p>reassume his role of assistant surgeon. </p><p>When the last fresh bandage was in place, </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>7i </p><p>the doctor straightened up and rested his </p><p>hands on his aching back. But he per- </p><p>mitted himself little relaxation. </p><p> Rapidly he scrawled a list of his medical</p><p>needs and gave it to Jack. </p><p> “We’ll have to bring Bundy in the house,”</p><p>he told the foreman. “Then I'll have the </p><p>three of them under my eye, and can man- </p><p>age till you return. Bring the Beckner </p><p>boys back with you. They’re friendly to </p><p>Norn and are good reliable fellows. Now </p><p>for Bundy.”	*</p><p> They found Bundy sprawled out on the</p><p>bunk, inert and stupid, and carried him into </p><p>the house. </p><p> Then Desert Jack hitched a fresh team</p><p>to the spring wagon, and called to the girl. </p><p>She came out, with Dickie clinging to her </p><p>arm, and, silent and forlorn, obeyed Jack’s </p><p>gruff suggestion— </p><p> “You’d better get in the back seat.”</p><p> These men, she thought, seemed leagued</p><p>against her. Even Norn, the moment dan- </p><p>ger ceased to threaten her, put her from </p><p>him. She had thought to make some at- </p><p>tempt to repay him for what he had done </p><p>for her by tender nursing, by reading to </p><p>him, by many little soothing attentions, but, </p><p>it seemed, she was not wanted. Doubtless </p><p>the gruff and grizzled being, guiding the </p><p>horses through the gray gloom, was right— </p><p>there was nothing that she could do. She </p><p>was only a responsibility, a burden. And </p><p>she had been wickedly selfish. To rid her- </p><p>self of worry, she had foolishily ridden into </p><p>the desert, against the repeated warnings of </p><p>her uncle. To Norn she had brought noth- </p><p>ing but agony. LitUe wonder they desired </p><p>to be rid of her. </p><p> When they were on the main road, and</p><p>within a few miles of town, Desert Jack </p><p>squirmed a little as he recalled his gruff </p><p>treatment of the girl. </p><p> “You see, miss,” he half-apologized over</p><p>his shoulder, “a woman that hain’t used to </p><p>shootin’ can’t do much. I don’t say it’s her </p><p>fault, but she’s better off all snug and quiet</p><p>in town. Not that we don’t want you and </p><p>the boy around, but because it’s better fer </p><p>you to be where folks—er—r—r—don’t </p><p>have to worry about you. Understand?” </p><p>“Yes; I understand,” she replied sorrow- </p><p>fully. </p><p> Desert Jack, noting her sorrowful tone,</p><p>mentally concluded that explanations or </p><p>near-apologies were wasted on a woman. </p><p>He wagged his head hopelessly, and whipped </p><p>up the team, holding them to a rattling </p><p>pace. </p><p> Through the cottonwoods they saw the</p><p>lighted windows of the hotel office, and then </p><p>the white-sliirted figure of Uncle Charlie. </p><p> The old man emitted a joyous bellow of</p><p>welcome and waddled down and swept </p><p>Dora and Dickie to his breast. Desert </p><p>Jack, taking advantage of the excitement, </p><p>drove on to rout out the druggist. </p><p>CHAPTER XIV </p><p>ALMOST imperceptibly the mild </p><p>desert Winter faded into the inef- </p><p>fable but ephemeral beauty of the </p><p>desert Spring. The snow, which had given </p><p>to the crests of Rain-maker and Witch-talk </p><p>the semblance of shattered marble, disap- </p><p>peared with magical suddenness, and the </p><p>mountains became murmurous with many </p><p>waters. Through the soft mists that </p><p>wreathed the peaks rainbow after rainbow </p><p>smiled back at the paternal sun. </p><p> But to the lonely girl, brooding on the</p><p>hotel porch, the smiling rainbow signaled no </p><p>message of hope. Desert Jack, a bi-weekly </p><p>town visitor, had kept Uncle Charlie in- </p><p>formed as to the various stages of Norn’s </p><p>convalescence, but had offered none of the </p><p>intimate details for which Dora’s heart </p><p>craved. She could not then bring herself </p><p>to question the grim, forbidding old foreman </p><p>who, while friendly enough with her uncle, </p><p>seemed intent on avoiding all contact with </p><p>her. </p><p> Even Uncle Charlie offered little or no</p><p>comfort. Following his bellow of joy at her </p><p>escape, he had at every opportunity, plied </p><p>her with questions concerning the fight and </p><p>its aftermath, until in desperation she had</p><p>begged him to permit her to forget the hor- </p><p>ror of that struggle. Thereafter, the old </p><p>man had refrained from any reference to </p><p>the battle, contenting himself with giving </p><p>her brief excerpts from Jack’s reports con- </p><p>cerning Norn’s condition. </p><p> The girl, sad and introspective, took to</p><p>watching the desert road. Some day, per- </p><p>haps, he would appear, vital, graceful and </p><p>debonair as of yore. </p><p> “But,” whispered Despair, “what of it?</p><p>He does not love you. No word of love had </p><p>he ever said to you. You slipped your hand </p><p>into his and he made no response; you </p><p>kissed him and he was heedless.'” </p><p>Common Sense struggled for a hearing, </p><p>72 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>crying faintly: “He knew you were greatly </p><p>excited when you slipped your hand into </p><p>his; and, when you kissed him, he did not </p><p>respond because he was fighting his way up </p><p>from the valley of tlie shadow of death. Be </p><p>calm, be practical-” </p><p> Pride, cold and insolent, pushed Common</p><p>Sense aside, and pointed toward the East, </p><p>saying: </p><p> “Return to your own land and forget this</p><p>place of sun and sand, this place where men </p><p>die with curses on their lips, where hard-bit- </p><p>ten souls press on to some nameless goal. </p><p>Why should you, at whose feet many men </p><p>have groveled, pine and fret because one </p><p>man does not send you a message? What </p><p>is he to you? Return to your security, </p><p>seeking the safety of your old aloofness. </p><p>Become the amused woman again, the spec- </p><p>tator, the watcher. Have done with this </p><p>foolish yearning, this agonizing. You need </p><p>no man’s love.” </p><p> Then the voice of Pride faltered before</p><p>the golden tones of Love. </p><p> “Pride is an empty-headed braggart,”</p><p>quoth Love calmly. “Listen, and I will </p><p>give you the wisdom of ages. My favor is </p><p>cheap at any cost. How can the man help </p><p>loving you, since you love him? Go to him, </p><p>speak your innermost thoughts, be unafraid. </p><p>Cast aside encumbering conventionalities, </p><p>for I smile on those who dare. Has not the </p><p>man offered up his body to wounds for your </p><p>sake? What more could you ask? Why </p><p>require silly little words? Why cling to the </p><p>customs of weak, faltering fools who always </p><p>lose in the game of life and of love?” </p><p> Well, she would write him a letter. She</p><p>locked herself in her room and began a </p><p>struggle with the greeting. </p><p> “Dear Mr. Norn” seemed too formal for</p><p>the eye of a man who had dared death for </p><p>her sake. She tore the paper into bits. </p><p>“My dear King Norn” impressed her as </p><p>being labored and it went the way of the </p><p>first. At last she decided to give a little </p><p>touch of bravado to the greeting, and ac- </p><p>cordingly she wrote: </p><p>Dear Sir Knight: </p><p> Your major-domo, the redoubtable Jack, has for</p><p>some strange reason, refrained from giving us the </p><p>details of your recovery. The days and weeks have </p><p>passed and we have heard no word from you beyond </p><p>the bare fact of your convalescence. We- </p><p> The “us’s” and the “we’s” annoyed her.</p><p>Why was she so chary of that brave little </p><p>pronoun “I”? </p><p> She tore the page into very small bits, de-</p><p>ciding to write what was in her heart, just </p><p>to see how it looked on paper. Of course </p><p>she would not mail the letter. She started </p><p>bravely enough, but the effort was no prize- </p><p>winning composition. </p><p>My darling: </p><p> I love you-</p><p> Humor came to her rescue and she</p><p>laughed at the school-girlish lines. What </p><p>would Norn, the virile, the reader of good </p><p>books, the worldly-wise, the far-seeing— </p><p>what would he say if his eyes fell on those </p><p>mawkish lines? Where was her mental </p><p>poise, her calm serene outlook? Couldn’t </p><p>she think of anything beyond, “My dar- </p><p>ling—I love you”? Apparently she could </p><p>not, for she tore the paper into infinitesimal </p><p>bits, and sighed like any love-lorn maid. </p><p> NORN, his wounds healed, reposed</p><p>in an easy chair on the sunny porch </p><p>of the ranch-house, and hearkened </p><p>to the pleas of one Rat Bundy,.and a cer- </p><p>tain humble and chastened Bill. It seemed </p><p>the twain were very grateful for certain </p><p>favors they had received at the hands of </p><p>Norn, and entertained fond hopes of having </p><p>the slate wiped clean. They were not, as </p><p>yet, able to work, but would be in time— </p><p>barring the anniversary of the snake-bite </p><p>which, according to the doctor, would bring </p><p>a mild recurrence of the symptoms—yes, in </p><p>time they would be fully competent as cow- </p><p>hands, post-hole diggers—in fact they would </p><p>welcome any sort of labor that would give </p><p>them an opportunity to prove that their </p><p>hearts were rightly placed. </p><p> “Very well,” Norn agreed. “Go to work</p><p>when you’re able.” </p><p> The rancher, like all fighting men, cher-</p><p>ished no hatred. Senseless hatred, spout- </p><p>ing black abuse, and petty revenge seem </p><p>to be peculiar to the softlings who, when the </p><p>guns begin the death-talk, hurry home and </p><p>crawl under a table. </p><p> Bundy and Bill returned to the bunk-</p><p>house, counting themselves Norn men. </p><p>Thereafter they would serve him faithfully </p><p>and loyally—and they did. </p><p> Norn looked out over his pleasant do-</p><p>main, but his thoughts were not for the </p><p>green alfalfa fields or the fat cattle. He </p><p>was debating a question of far greater im- </p><p>portance than his possessions. Could he </p><p>now, with safety, tell her that he loved her? </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>73 </p><p>He had been convinced from the first that </p><p>the man who threw himself at her feet could </p><p>not hope to meet with favor, much less love. </p><p>To prize love, she must be made to seek it, </p><p>to suffer in the quest. He had suffered—the </p><p>puckered scars on his body attested that— </p><p>and she, too, must learn that love, despite </p><p>the poets, treads no primrose path. </p><p> Of course she admired him, and was</p><p>doubtless grateful, but he did not want ad- </p><p>miration or gratitude, nor caresses born of </p><p>excitement. What he desired was love, </p><p>unprompted by anything save his natural </p><p>ability to attract and to hold it. The smit- </p><p>ten yokel might pursue the maid of his </p><p>choice, but he, King Norn, would trust to </p><p>attraction. If attraction failed, he would </p><p>not murmur. </p><p> Still, Love required certain little ameni-</p><p>ties. Perhaps a letter—a cheerful humor- </p><p>ous letter—to her would bring a welcome </p><p>reply. And he might have Desert Jack </p><p>take her some roses. Surely such a gift </p><p>would not place him in the category of the </p><p>frantic egotists she had so calmly rebuffed. </p><p>Unaware of Desert Jack’s brusk treat- </p><p>ment of the girl, he presumed she under- </p><p>stood that, in sending her back to town, his </p><p>only thought had been for her comfort and </p><p>safety. He did not know that the old fore- </p><p>man had, largely by avoiding the girl, sought </p><p>to convince her that Norn was glad to sever </p><p>an acquaintance that had brought nothing </p><p>but danger and suffering. </p><p> Desert Jack came up to the porch, and,</p><p>rather shamefacedly, gave Norn a huge </p><p>bouquet of wild asters he had gathered on </p><p>his return from town. </p><p> Norn’s eyes brightened at the old fel-</p><p>low’s thoughtfulness. </p><p> “Thought you might like ’em,” Jack</p><p>said, somewhat sheepishly. </p><p> “You old scamp,” Norn exclaimed affec-</p><p>tionately; and laughed. </p><p> Jack dodged playfully and seated himself</p><p>at the young man’s feet. He lighted his </p><p>pipe and puffed for a time. </p><p> “Yeh huh,” he recalled softly, “your ma</p><p>always liked flowers. Recollect when you </p><p>was a little feller, me and you would get her </p><p>the first flowers. Huh, one thing brings </p><p>another. Jes’ such a Spring day as this </p><p>you was born, King. I brung your ma some </p><p>flowers like these, and she jes’ insisted that </p><p>I hold you. Your pa was there so tickled he </p><p>was cryin’. . I give you back to your ma, </p><p>and your pa follered me out and give me a </p><p>handful of gold. Says he, ‘Jack, I ain’t a </p><p>drinkin’ man and on you depends the honor </p><p>o’ celebratin’ the arrival of the new owner </p><p>of this ranch. Go to town and turn it up </p><p>on its left ear.’ Maybe you think I didn’t </p><p>foller directions. Ask any o’ the old-timers </p><p>and they’ll tell you that folks marked time </p><p>by that celebration.” </p><p> A long pause and then casually:</p><p> “Talked with Uncle Charlie jes’ ’fore I</p><p>started home. He said his niece was fig- </p><p>gerin’ on startin’ back East fer keeps next </p><p>week-” </p><p> Norn straightened up, and winced as</p><p>though against a stab of pain. </p><p> “What’s up, King?” Jack exclaimed,</p><p>with quick solicitude. “That side bother </p><p>you?” </p><p> “Nothing—just a twinge. Go on. You</p><p>said—she had decided to leave—next week.” </p><p>“Uh hull,” Jack went on in gossipy fash- </p><p>ion. “Boy’s well and strong now, and </p><p>Uncle Charlie says she’s sick of this coun- </p><p>try. I told him that wimmin, as a gen’ral </p><p>rule, were more responsibility than they’re </p><p>worth. She was in the office and heard me. </p><p>She come out and says she, ‘Mr. Jack, I’m </p><p>sorry if I’ve been a burden to any one. </p><p>You can convey my regrets to Mr. Norn, </p><p>and bid him farewell for me.’ Them’s her </p><p>very words, and, I'm bound to admit, the </p><p>way she said ’em made me duck and dodge. </p><p>Uncle Charlie seemed all rattled and shuck </p><p>up. He tells me, on the side, every time he </p><p>opens his mouth he puts his foot in it. </p><p>Guess I got the same habit. Well, anyway </p><p>she's goin’, and I reckon the country will </p><p>take a rest-” </p><p> “Jack!” Sharply imperative.</p><p>The old man dodged. Norn gave him a </p><p>long somber look. Then the rancher, rising </p><p>abruptly, dropped the flowers in his chair, </p><p>and paced the length of the porch and back. </p><p>“How’s my gait?” </p><p> “Steady enough,” admitted the puzzled</p><p>foreman. </p><p> “How do I look?” _</p><p> “Not so bad. Little pale around the</p><p>gills, though. Sunburn’s off you, and I’d </p><p>say you’re short fifteen pounds.” </p><p> “Think I’d stand a ride to town—and</p><p>look like anything when I got there?” </p><p>“Why, yes,” Jack debated. “If you </p><p>take it easy and don’t over-do.” </p><p> “Then get Spot and my best saddle.”</p><p>This with suppressed excitement that added </p><p>to the foreman’s puzzlement. “And, </p><p>74 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Jack—” over his shoulder as he hurried </p><p>into the house—“don’t talk so much.” </p><p> Jack gaped weakly and wagged his head.</p><p>Sharp words from a youngster he had </p><p>raised. Remotely his mind, dulled with </p><p>long years of labor, connectcd the girl with </p><p>Norn’s unusual outburst. </p><p> “Dawg-gone a hoodoo woman,” he grum-</p><p>bled on his way to the stable. “Can't she </p><p>see he wants to get shut of her.” </p><p> Carefully he curried and saddled the</p><p>spotted horse. The animal had had a long </p><p>rest, and, as Jack led him up to the porch, </p><p>he gave vent to his spirits by little pranc- </p><p>ings and playful nips at the foreman’s arm. </p><p>To Norn he nickered a soft welcome. </p><p> “Ho-ho, old boy,” laughed the rancher,</p><p>“I’m glad to see you.” </p><p> He pressed his cheek against the velvety</p><p>muzzle. He mounted and settled himself </p><p>in the saddle. What a joy it was to feel a </p><p>horse between his knees again, to look up </p><p>at the sky instead of a ceiling, to recover </p><p>health and strength. Wonderful world. </p><p> The sunshine of gladness flooded his soul.</p><p>He leaned from the saddle and gripped the </p><p>old man’s shoulder. </p><p> “I told John to put the flowers you</p><p>brought in water. And, Jack, forget what </p><p>I said—about you talking too much. </p><p>Good-by.” </p><p> Desert Jack looked after the man who</p><p>held all the affection of his cynical old </p><p>heart. </p><p> “Same as he was when a boy,” he softly</p><p>soliloquized. “Sorry the moment he hurt </p><p>your feelin’s—ready to say he was wrong.” </p><p>Norn cantered down the Hemper road </p><p>conscious that all his line of calm reasoning </p><p>had crumpled before the sweeping assault </p><p>of one fact—she was going away. There </p><p>was now no time for further experiments. </p><p>Love, he now humbly admitted, could not </p><p>be reduced to a scientific basis. Nothing </p><p>possessed sufficient strength to either coax </p><p>or coerce love. Even the circle of danger</p><p>with which he had surrounded her was a web </p><p>of gauze to stay the coming or the going of </p><p>love. </p><p> What man, worthy of love, would pause</p><p>at any circle of danger though it were woven </p><p>of the fires of hell? Bah, he had done too </p><p>much thinking. Love was heedless of </p><p>thoughts or words, or even deeds, delight- </p><p>ing in upsetting all the calculations of man, </p><p>in nullifying his most carefully-planned </p><p>actions, in snapping rosy fingers under the </p><p>nose of the philosopher, in refuting all that </p><p>has ever been said or written since man rose </p><p>from the primeval slime. </p><p> Despite his claims of dominance, his per-</p><p>fervid announcements of superiority, his </p><p>eager acceptance of the empty title of pur- </p><p>suer, man, when it came to love, was, com- </p><p>pared to woman, a conceited numbskull, a </p><p>passer of bouquets to self, a half-wit fumb- </p><p>ling with the dynamite of destiny. Woman, </p><p>love’s trusted agent, enjoyed plenipoten- </p><p>tiary powers rightly denied blundering man. </p><p>She was versed in love’s secret diplomacy, </p><p>and she knew, long, long before the. self- </p><p>imagined dominant one awoke from his </p><p>trance of egotism, the winning moves in the </p><p>ancient game. </p><p> About all a man could do was to tell her</p><p>that he loved her—a fact, no doubt, of </p><p>which she was well aware from the moment </p><p>of their first meeting. He, King Norn, </p><p>ranked not one notch above one of his cow- </p><p>boys riding to learn his fate from the lips of </p><p>some giggling girl. </p><p> To plan, to think, to do anything save to</p><p>tell her that he loved her was futile. If she </p><p>smiled, heaven would be his; if she was un- </p><p>responsive, he could only return to the old </p><p>desert and suffer—and somehow survive. </p><p> Suddenly weariness overwhelmed him and</p><p>he felt sick and faint. He was not as strong </p><p>as he had supposed. She must not see him </p><p>worn and faint. He longed to see her, but </p><p>pride insisted on an appearance of strength. </p><p>He would rest a little, and then, as of yore, </p><p>dash into town. Dismounting, he noted </p><p>that the movement jarred him. As he </p><p>stretched out by the roadside, he drew a </p><p>deep breath of the perfumed air, and then </p><p>relaxed. Nature, working unceasingly to </p><p>restore energy, whispered to him—</p><p> “Sleep, sleep, sleep.”</p><p> Just a few moments of blessed repose and</p><p>he would press on to learn his fate. But </p><p>the kindly mothering desert had a different </p><p>plan. Soothed by the murmurous voices of </p><p>Spring, warmed by the friendly sun, he fell </p><p>asleep. </p><p> DORA, after her epistolary failures,</p><p>had brooded for a few days, and </p><p>then had resolved to make what she </p><p>considered a final desperate move. She </p><p>would, at the first opportunity, get word to </p><p>Norn that she had decided to return to her </p><p>Eastern home. If the man cared, he would </p><p>bestir himself; if he was indifferent, she </p><p>The Survivor </p><p>75 </p><p>could find some surcease from pain in the </p><p>thronging city. </p><p> Calmly she informed Uncle Charlie of her</p><p>decision. He plumped down in his chair, </p><p>nearly wrecking it. </p><p> “My Gawd, Dora, you don’t mean it,” he</p><p>wheezed. “What’ll I do? I’ll be so lone- </p><p>some, I’ll want to die.” </p><p> A grampus sigh, and then meekly:</p><p> “Well, I s’pose this town holds nothin’ for</p><p>you. I had hoped, though, that you’d-” </p><p> “Oh, I’m not leaving today,” she inter-</p><p>rupted, with a little, teasing laugh. “Some- </p><p>time next week—maybe.” </p><p> “Maybe?” echoed Uncle Charlie, clutch-</p><p>ing at straws. </p><p> She nodded brightly, and left him to his</p><p>thoughts. </p><p> The next day fortune favored her plan,</p><p>and Desert Jack, as related, became an un- </p><p>witting Cupid. She watched the foreman </p><p>drive down the desert road. Norn, now, </p><p>doubtless, able to ride, would have time </p><p>after Desert Jack arrived at the ranch to </p><p>ride to town before dark. Surely—if he </p><p>cared—he would come. It was just a </p><p>chance; and she shivered with nervous </p><p>dread. </p><p> Reading was a bore, there was no solace</p><p>in music, even Dickie oppressed her. If </p><p>Norn started Hemperward—and the </p><p>thought made her heart leap—she might </p><p>ride out and meet him—accidently. </p><p> Danger? She snapped her fingers and</p><p>tossed her head proudly. She had met Dan- </p><p>ger face to face, and had not whimpered. </p><p>Then, though she did not name it, she now </p><p>knew that Norn’s spirit walked before her </p><p>as a lictor walks before royalty. No more, </p><p>she had not failed to note, was she greeted </p><p>with bland, insinuating smiles. The men of </p><p>the desert now ventured naught but brief, </p><p>respectful salutations, seemingly intent on </p><p>passing her as quickly as possible.</p><p> Hurriedly she donned her riding-habit,</p><p>and was soon galloping down the desert road. </p><p>When she came to the ranch road, she </p><p>halted to debate what seemed to her a most </p><p>momentous question. Should she ride on </p><p>boldly and meet him, or should she turn </p><p>about and permit him to overtake her? </p><p>Deliberately she refused to contemplate the </p><p>probability of disappointment. </p><p> She became conscious of faint, plaintive</p><p>cries drifting down from the void above her. </p><p>She looked up and smiled at a long V of wild </p><p>geese moving steadily northward. No hu- </p><p>man bickering for them, no false pride, no </p><p>evasiveness. Their sure, swift flight was </p><p>their answer to the ancient call. They </p><p>swerved slightly, and she lost them in the </p><p>glow of the sinking sun. </p><p> Suddenly she was thrilled with wild re-</p><p>bellion against every tiling that kept her </p><p>from the man she loved. What folly it was </p><p>to quibble with Fate, to exact conditions, to </p><p>listen to the solemn pratings of pride. She </p><p>would go to him—now. Even to the ranch. </p><p> She turned her horse into the ranch road,</p><p>laughing excitedly. </p><p> When she saw the spotted horse, and the</p><p>prostrate figure in the sand, her heart almost </p><p>stopped beating. She could not imagine </p><p>Norn inactive, or resting. He was hurt. </p><p> But he had seen her coming. After all—•</p><p>and he smiled faintly—his theory of attrac- </p><p>tion held real values. He blessed the weak- </p><p>ness that had prompted the siesta in the sun, </p><p>and pretended to be asleep. </p><p> She fell on her knees at his side, sobbing—</p><p> “You’re hurt, oh, I know you must be</p><p>hurt!” </p><p> There was no mistaking the poignant love-</p><p>note—the wicked dissembler—he rose as </p><p>though greatly startled. Then he laughed </p><p>softly. </p><p> Despite her protest against his over-exer-</p><p>tion, he assisted her to rise; and then, </p><p>scarcely knowing how it happened, she was </p><p>in his arms and they were murmuring the </p><p>age-old nonsense of lovers.</p><p> Came the purple evening, with a sickle</p><p>moon, attended by a single star, hanging </p><p>low over Witch-talk’s crest. </p><p> “The desert is a paradise now,” sighed the</p><p>girl. </p><p> His reply was all that she could desire—</p><p> “With you—yes.”</p><p>A FISH 5TOBY ABOUT LOVE </p><p>by .Harold Tiius </p><p>Author of “Appreciating Pcler,” “Strength of the Gentle'' etc. </p><p>GHIDEON LIMES was dictating,	would state sample shipment Phenix Brand</p><p>The sunlight of early April,	galvanized iron were—was—In reply would</p><p>wholly Springlike for the first	state sample shipment Phenix Brand gal-</p><p>■ time, streamed through the win-	vanized iron was not up to our required</p><p>dow of his office, spattered on the nude standard.

Gideon was slumped</p><p>in hip chair, the bare suggestion of a smile </p><p>on his face. He sat so a moment, hands </p><p>loosely clasped across his rotund stomach; </p><p>his lips moved in soundless syllables. He </p><p>rose languidly. </p><p> “That’ll do for now,” he said, as if he</p><p>thought of other things. </p><p> He gazed into the street below. He</p><p>jingled his keys. He turned and looked </p><p>at the picture again. Hulbert, the fore- </p><p>man, came in, letting the din of machinery </p><p>through the door. Limes sighed impa- </p><p>tiently and walked heavily toward him. </p><p> And Washington C. Kirk, who should</p><p>have had his mind on the work before him, </p><p>followed the corpulent walk until his em- </p><p>ployer had passed down between the rows </p><p>of bumping presses. His blue eyes shifted, </p><p>then, to the small, competent head of Vera </p><p>Somers and rested there for so tcnacious an </p><p>interval that the young lady looked up </p><p>from her note-book, left off pattering the </p><p>keys of her typewriter, and, with her smil- </p><p>ing brown ones, met them. She flushed, </p><p>her eyes flamed, her trim shoulders trem- </p><p>bled and she turned back to her work, </p><p>leaving toward him one smooth, pink cheek, </p><p>tempting to a degree. </p><p> Just that, but when Kirk forced his gaze</p><p>back at the task before him he found that </p><p>it was a trifle giddy, that the symbols on </p><p>bills and invoices were less prosaic and, </p><p>could he have known, the look that hinted </p><p>at loneliness which liad been in them for </p><p>four long months had almost disappeared. </p><p> For those four long months young Kirk</p><p>had functioned as stock and shipping clerk </p><p>in the Detroit factory of the G. Limes Can- </p><p>Screw Works aqd during that span, though </p><p>he rubbed elbows with those about him, </p><p>he had lived in complete isolation. </p><p> Limes, the stodgy bachelor, could scarcely</p><p>be expected to grow companionable with </p><p>the lowliest of his office staff. “Puny” </p><p>Boggs, who kept the books, was not the type </p><p>to grow chummy with a youth. Hulbert’s </p><p>digestive disorders made it difficult for him </p><p>to handle the factory force, let alone make </p><p>friends. And Miss Somers, the efficient, </p><p>the intent, had so impressed him with the </p><p>impersonal quality of her manner that from </p><p>the first he had told himself that hope of </p><p>familiar contact there was impossible. </p><p> But now, when their smiling glances met</p><p>and struck response, he knew that he had </p><p>been mistaken, knew that behind the girl’s </p><p>office demeanor lurked characteristics that</p><p>were far from repelling, and the realization </p><p>warmed him—even more than did the shaft </p><p>of sunlight, now streaming full across his </p><p>desk. </p><p> His attention, like his eyes, persisted</p><p>in straying across the fitter before him, </p><p>across the floor to Vera Somers’ desk, where </p><p>they lingered, speculating. </p><p>HWHEN the noon gong sounded </p><p>Kirk whisked through the office </p><p>door and trotted the four blocks </p><p>to the one dingy restaurant the vicinity </p><p>afforded; then back again, after gastro- </p><p>nomic accomplishments of rather amazing </p><p>78 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>rapidity. He knew that the girl brought </p><p>her lunch with her. </p><p> When he reentered the office, that lunch</p><p>scarcely tasted yet, was arrayed on a nap- </p><p>kin spread over Vera’s desk. She looked </p><p>up at the unusual intrusion, a sandwich </p><p>half-way to her mouth—a mouth as red as </p><p>the glass of jelly staining the linen. She </p><p>smiled and tossed her head, a gesture which </p><p>was not at all like an intent executive, so </p><p>girlish, so gay. </p><p> He approached slowly, not just certain of</p><p>himself, and stood before her stiffly. </p><p> “The sunshine,” he began, “sort of fogged</p><p>up our esteemed employer’s mind.” </p><p> She laughed and bent forward quickly.</p><p>“Poor old fellow!” she cried, and Wash </p><p>Kirk thrilled at the lilt in her unbusiness- </p><p>like voice. “He gets that way every Spring </p><p>when the first warm days come and he com- </p><p>mences to dream of fishing.” </p><p> “Can’t blame him,” said the boy still,</p><p>uneasy, not knowing just what to say to </p><p>this girl. “The Boardman’s a great stream, </p><p>especially for Browns.” </p><p> “Oh! Are you a fisherman, too?”</p><p> She looked up, quite amazed. Wash</p><p>Kirk flushed. Her quick interest was as </p><p>pleasing as it was evident. </p><p> “Not his kind. My home’s in the trout</p><p>country and fishing is just like sleeping </p><p>well or eating with a good appetite. Mat- </p><p>ter of course. We expect it.” </p><p> “You came from the country!” she</p><p>breathed, incredulously. “Isn’t that fine!” </p><p>Her brown eyes were wide and, realizing, </p><p>Kirk felt his assurance mounting. </p><p> “Which: coming from the country or</p><p>coming from the country?” </p><p> “Oh, just knowing it, being a part of it</p><p>My, how we city folks envy you!” </p><p> His blue eyes searched her face at that,</p><p>prying to find insincerity. She sat relaxed</p><p>in her chair, mouth drooping a trifle as </p><p>though she were tired. She seemed a little </p><p>girl there, wholly unlike the self-reliant per- </p><p>son who had awed him. </p><p> “I guess you mean it,” he said, delighted,</p><p>leaning a hip against her desk. “I’ve heard </p><p>people say it who didn’t mean it.” </p><p> “Of course I mean it,” she replied, se-</p><p>riously. “I’ve never seen the country except </p><p>at a resort at too many dollars a week. </p><p>I’ve never known country people or any- </p><p>thing but city ways until I came here. </p><p> “Poor Mr. Limes! He isn’t very graphic</p><p>and he never talks to me except on business, </p><p>but sometimes I think I get more out of </p><p>the letters he dictates to his fishing pals </p><p>than I do out of anything else—about </p><p>the country. He’s awfully prosy, but I </p><p>know how deeply he feels about rivers and </p><p>woods and sometimes when he’s been send- </p><p>ing off letters about them, or his vacation </p><p>plans, or the fish he has caught, I can’t get </p><p>down to work for hours.” </p><p> Wash Kirk’s manner changed. The re-</p><p>straint left him. He moved around the </p><p>desk, seated himself on its edge, heedless of </p><p>the way his coat threatened disaster to the </p><p>unconsumed meal and said: </p><p> “That’s funny! Here I’ve been on the</p><p>job four months, with never a soul to talk </p><p>to about the open, believing that you all, </p><p>that you especially, didn’t have time to </p><p>think of anything but the city. </p><p> “I’ve lost weight for loneliness. You</p><p>see, it’s horribly necessary that I stay here </p><p>a while, a long while, and I was just about </p><p>getting down to the ragged edge, what </p><p>with being lonesome and not knowing any- </p><p>body who’d agree with me about a city and </p><p>not being able to take my job or any of your </p><p>jobs as seriously as you people seem to take </p><p>them—I—gee whiz! Miss Somers, why </p><p>didn’t you say something?” </p><p> “Say something! How was I to know</p><p>that anybody in this rackety place knew </p><p>about the tilings I’ve longed for?” </p><p> And so they went on, each revealing to</p><p>the other; the one the eagerness to learn, </p><p>the other the longing to re-live by telling,</p><p>eyes warming intimately, Kirk hitching </p><p>along the desk closer to her as each freshly </p><p>discovered common interest delighted him. </p><p> “You said,” she ventured in a pause,''</p><p>“that it was necessary—horribly necessary </p><p>—for you to stay here.” </p><p> “Yes? Well, it is,” shaking his head</p><p>slowly. “You see, my dad’s a queer old </p><p>bird. He’s the Gaylord Potato-Planter </p><p>Company, which you’ve never heard of. </p><p>If I stay here long enough, it’ll be me. </p><p> “My governor started that factory when</p><p>I was so big. Now it’s going to be pretty </p><p>much mine—maybe. Last year dad got </p><p>the idea that we had no efficiency, no </p><p>modern methods, all tliat sort of thing. </p><p>So he sends Washington G. out into the </p><p>world to learn the manufacturing game. </p><p> “ ‘Go out,’ says he, ‘stay a year, come</p><p>back with a letter of recommendation that </p><p>you’ve won by hard work and enterprise, </p><p>and the management’s yours.’ </p><p>A Fish Story About Love </p><p>79 </p><p> “Fine, understand. But my dad! He's</p><p>rock-ribbed. If I should fall down-” </p><p> He whistled two little descending notes</p><p>of apprehension. </p><p> “I’d have to take my chance in some</p><p>place like the Limes Can-Screw Works for </p><p>good—and then where’d I be? </p><p> “I don’t amount to much,” he went on</p><p>after the silent interval which followed his </p><p>shoulder-shrug. “If I did I’d take this </p><p>year’s stunt seriously. I’ve learned a lot, </p><p>but somehow I like our little factory better. </p><p>Only ten men, understand. We call ’em all </p><p>by their first names and they do us. My </p><p>mother is neighborly with their wives. </p><p>When one of ’em wants a day’s fishing, he </p><p>takes it, and if we’re behind we all work </p><p>evenings. We haven’t had a man leave </p><p>since I can remember. </p><p> “It’s the usual tiling for country boys to</p><p>come to the city. I’ve never wanted to. </p><p>Since I’ve been here I’ve wanted to get </p><p>back home—awfully! Why, the folks here </p><p>’re all pitiable to me. Poor old Limes, </p><p>with his eight per cent, of the year fishing! </p><p>And Boggs! Think of a man spending his </p><p>life taking ledgers so seriously. I’m not </p><p>under-estimating his importance, but he’d </p><p>be a lot better bookkeeper even if he took </p><p>Limes’ advice and played a little. </p><p> “Hulbert—I’ll bet he hasn’t laughed</p><p>since he saw his first automobile. He thinks </p><p>the sun rises and sets among those machines. </p><p>He doesn’t even know parks, let alone that </p><p>rivers run and winds blow! </p><p> “And I’ve got to try to be like those men</p><p>for a year—gee whiz!” </p><p> He told her of his home, of the great cut-</p><p>over lands, the plains of northern Michigan, </p><p>of fish he had caught, grouse he had killed, </p><p>the furs he had trapped for his mother; he </p><p>etched cedar swamps under Winter moons </p><p>and duck-shooting on Houghton Lake. </p><p>He told of running white water in a canoe, </p><p>of hiking through Autumn woods. He </p><p>talked of wild flowers and birds. </p><p> He enthused over his dogs, the setter,</p><p>the hounds; over skating and skiing, de- </p><p>scribed his runs on snow-shoes. He dis- </p><p>cussed the fine craft of camping and went </p><p>into ecstasies over sunsets and storms. She </p><p>listened eagerly to his stories of the lumber </p><p>camps, of weather indications, and without </p><p>consciousness whatever, she leaned toward </p><p>him, pointed chin in her hand, eyes reflect- </p><p>ing her hunger for more. </p><p> “But,” she argued finally, “all you have</p><p>to do is make good on this job and you can </p><p>go back to it. Think of us who’ve never </p><p>had a chance to know what you know, who </p><p>dislike this racket and rush just as much </p><p>as you do.” </p><p> “Yes, make good on this job,” he inter-</p><p>rupted, scowling absently. “I haven’t a </p><p>chance of going back unless I make good; </p><p>my governor’s that sort. So I will—I’ve </p><p>got to, now!” Then, focusing his eyes on </p><p>her face—“I think you’re going to like it </p><p>very much up there.” </p><p> “Oh!” she said with a catch of her</p><p>breath and started back. </p><p> Nor did she allow him to kiss her—not</p><p>for three full weeks. </p><p> AFTER they had made their pact</p><p>they decided, quite originally, they </p><p>foolishly thought, to keep it wholly </p><p>to themselves for an indefinite time. </p><p> “Having it a secret will make it all the</p><p>better, won’t it?” he asked, as several </p><p>million lovers annually ask. </p><p> Walks in the parks followed, and long,</p><p>rainy evenings together, reading aloud from </p><p>books and from one another’s faces. And </p><p>no one else knew—not a soul! </p><p> One May morning after he called Vera</p><p>for the first dictations Gideon Limes un- </p><p>wrapped a bundle from the printers. It </p><p>contained big white boards with black </p><p>characters on them— </p><p>SMOKING POSITIVELY PROHIBITED. </p><p>And while he sat there he wielded a heavy- </p><p>leaded pencil on one of the placards. Then, </p><p>quite deliberately, seriousness reflected in his </p><p>little gray eyes, he held it up.</p><p> “Oh, Kirk,” said he, “tack this up where</p><p>it’ll do the most good.” </p><p> In a flaming flush the boy read—</p><p>LOVE AFFAIRS POSITIVELY </p><p>PROHIBITED. </p><p> Limes tossed it rather indifferently to</p><p>Kirk’s desk and began the day’s work. </p><p> At noon the lad said to his sweetheart:</p><p>“The old chump! How’d he find out? </p><p>I suppose it’s his idea of a joke.” </p><p> Vera eyed him a long moment.</p><p> “I wish I could think that, dear. You</p><p>see, I know him so well, and I’m sure he </p><p>didn’t do it to be funny. He meant it. </p><p>The fact is, he’s come to depend on me for </p><p>so many things that he doesn’t like to </p><p>bother with, that he’d have to do if I didn’t. </p><p>8o </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “There’s no sentiment in his life. He’s</p><p>never been in love. The only thing he </p><p>considers now is that he’s in danger of </p><p>losing me. He’d be awfully mad if he </p><p>thought you intended taking me away </p><p>from here. </p><p> “If it weren’t for circumstances we</p><p>wouldn’t care a rap, but you know, dear, </p><p>that if we fail to get our letter of recom- </p><p>mendation out of this office it means six </p><p>months lost—and six months is a terribly </p><p>long time!” </p><p> Kirk nodded grave assent.</p><p> A week passed, the two particularly care-</p><p>ful to display no indications of affection and </p><p>Limes, looking over his fat shoulder, grunted </p><p>a summons for Wash. </p><p> “Ever fish much, Kirk?” he asked, and</p><p>before an answer could be given—as tf </p><p>the reply were of no consequence whatever </p><p>—went on. “It’s my religion—fishing. My </p><p>picture* there,” nodding. “Spend a month </p><p>near Traverse City every Summer. </p><p> “Most time to go, now. Every time I</p><p>get ready to go, I think about something </p><p>that happened a few years back. </p><p> “Had a rod. Wonderful rod. Moller</p><p>Dry-Fly Special. Built for me; four ounce, </p><p>eight feet, balanced like a watch. Great </p><p>for night fishing when you can’t see your </p><p>fly. Could always tell by the feel just what </p><p>I was doing. </p><p> “Got so I depended on that rod. It did</p><p>my fishing for me. Didn’t realize for a </p><p>long time what its value was. </p><p> “Fella come up to our camp who didn’t</p><p>know the game. We fishermen don’t take </p><p>to greenhorns much, but he was a nice fella </p><p>and wanted to learn. I lent him my rod. </p><p> “He got a rise. Whipped back like a</p><p>greenhorn will, crazy to get his fly on the </p><p>water in a rush again. Hooked the brush </p><p>behind him. didn’t think, slashed down like </p><p>he was splittin’ wood. Put a set in that </p><p>rod of mine—strained it, understand.” </p><p> He looked at the photograph and blinked.</p><p>Then picked up a sheaf of papers. </p><p> “Ruined, you know,” wriggling forward</p><p>in his chair. “Ruined—ab-so-lutely! ' </p><p> “That’s all, Kirk.”</p><p> Wash moved toward his desk, puzzled.</p><p> “Oh, Kirk!” He faced about. “Since</p><p>then I’ve never let my likin’ for a fella </p><p>interfere with my own interests. Keep my </p><p>tackle to myself. Now, if a fella come </p><p>along and insisted on using anything I </p><p>depended on—I’d run him out of camp!” </p><p> With a pencil he commenced checking</p><p>footings on the papers he held. </p><p> As they walked that night in Palmer</p><p>Park Wash Kirk related the incident and </p><p>after a silent, hand-gripping moment Vera </p><p>sighed: </p><p> “It’ll go hard with us, I’m afraid. No</p><p>use shutting our eyes to it. He’s so set </p><p>in his ways that nothing can change him. </p><p>He can’t make himself think of giving up </p><p>an idea. Why, the way he quarrels with </p><p>his best friends in letters is frightful! </p><p> “If they catch more or bigger fish than</p><p>he does, he raves. If they disagree with </p><p>him about tackle he never forgets. He </p><p>hasn’t any use for anybody’s opinions or </p><p>wants—except the men who win big-fish </p><p>prizes in the magazines he reads. He almost </p><p>worships them, but other folks—he’s sure </p><p>to have his way at any price. </p><p> “You see, he’s bound I’m not going to</p><p>leave him. He thinks you’re to blame— </p><p>and he’ll—he’ll-” </p><p> “There, don’t fret!” he said, scowling up</p><p>into the trees. “If he fires me I can start </p><p>again. It’ll only be six months lost!” </p><p> “But I’m jealous of those'six" months! I</p><p>want you all, and I know you can’t love </p><p>me your fullest until you take me away!” </p><p>So day by day they strove to be oblivious </p><p>of one another and not heed the cloud that </p><p>impended—a bald-headed, gray-eyed cloud </p><p>which rumbled enigmatic thunder threats— </p><p>and the time grew shorter before their</p><p>month’s reprieve, when Limes would be </p><p>away. </p><p> “if we can tide things over until then,”</p><p>Wash said, frowning at the water from </p><p>their deck seats on a Belle Isle ferryboat. </p><p>“We have more of a chance. He’s getting </p><p>restless. The other day I saw him looking </p><p>into a fly-book on the sly and yesterday he </p><p>was discussing reels over the telephone. </p><p>He’ll be shy on patience and the least little </p><p>thing’s likely to spill our beans!” </p><p> “And if he does come back rested and</p><p>happy he may overlook what we fail to </p><p>cover up.” Vera said slowly, with the </p><p>procrastinating optimism of youth. </p><p>June’s first fortnight dragged along, </p><p>dragged for the boy and girl be- </p><p>cause dread was on them, with all </p><p>their happiness, and dragged for Gideon </p><p>because the call of the stream had fevered </p><p>his veins. The last days were a furious </p><p>harvest of detail and never before had </p><p>A Fish Story About Love </p><p>81 </p><p>Wash Kirk realized how fully Limes de- </p><p>pended on Vera. </p><p> She was his memory, his sense of cau-</p><p>tion, continually beside him, alert, antici- </p><p>pating wants, unobtrusively advising him, </p><p>taking the initiative at other times. The </p><p>two worked evenings and for a week the </p><p>lovers had little privacy. That told on the </p><p>girl even more than the long hours and </p><p>Kirk saw, with great pride, that she missed </p><p>him frightfully. </p><p> “No wonder he’s sore at me,” the boy</p><p>thought. </p><p> The last, mad day! Suit case, waders,</p><p>rods, hip boots, tackle boxes, creel, land- </p><p>ing net piled about him like offerings to </p><p>some fat god, Gideon Limes sat in his shirt- </p><p>sleeves, glaring at the final barriers which </p><p>kept him from freedom. Vera vibrated </p><p>between him and her desk, rattling off let- </p><p>ters with amazing speed, eyes bright, color </p><p>high, nerves strained. But now and then </p><p>she looked at Wash Kirk and the light in </p><p>her eyes softened, her mouth lost its tensity </p><p>and she smiled, most adorably. </p><p> Noon—two o’clock—an hour until train</p><p>time. Pen in hand, Gideon Limes hur- </p><p>riedly read the final letters. One by one, </p><p>he scrawled his signature and put them </p><p>aside. He gathered the last, reading, as </p><p>was his habit, with moving lips: </p><p> Acme Brass Foundry</p><p> Toledo, Ohio</p><p> Washington, Dearest!</p><p> He put down his pen. He turned pon-</p><p>derously to look at Vera. He kept on </p><p>moving until his gaze rested on Washing- </p><p>ton G. Kirk. He eyed the youth a moment, </p><p>then gave that summoning grunt. </p><p> When the apprehensive youth approached,</p><p>Limes, buttoning his collar, said: </p><p> “Of course, we’re sorry you have to leave</p><p>us, young man. I hope you can see your </p><p>way clear to staying on the customary two </p><p>weeks?” </p><p> Kirk’s mouth opened and closed twice</p><p>before words came. </p><p> “But I don’t want to quit, Mr. Limes!</p><p>I want to stay—I—why, I’ve been trying </p><p>my best; there hasn’t been a word said to </p><p>me. I-” </p><p> “Remember my spoiled rod? The fella</p><p>who used it did the best he could, too. </p><p> “Oh, Boggs!” lifting his voice and turn-</p><p>ing away as, with fat chin lifted and fat </p><p>e </p><p>fingers fumbling, he contrived a knot in </p><p>his black tie. </p><p> When he had gone, Boggs teetering after</p><p>for a last word, Vera gave way and, look- </p><p>ing into the sweltering street, cried openly. </p><p> “Never mind, sweetheart,” Kirk whis-</p><p>pered, putting his arms about her shoul- </p><p>ders. “I’ll hook on somewhere else.” </p><p> “If he were only like other men,” the</p><p>girl sobbed, “we might appeal to some </p><p>other side of him. But he knows only </p><p>th-this and fish-fishing. There’s no way </p><p>to approach-ch him. H-he-” </p><p> She looked up suddenly, tear-filled eyes</p><p>peculiarly jilert. </p><p>THE valley of the Boardman was </p><p>gathering its purple mists of even- </p><p>ing. The sun had gone, the cerise </p><p>bloom of the sky faded to a pink flush. The </p><p>river gurgled contentedly in the quiet, its </p><p>surface rosied in places, polished ebony in </p><p>others, and here and there flecked by silver </p><p>as a snag or ripple broke the even flow. </p><p>A stranger, in black relief, was casting </p><p>across the stream and above the water hung </p><p>a myriad of insects, wide, gauzy-winged </p><p>creatures, the caddis-fly, born at dusk to </p><p>live its span of minutes and pass on. </p><p> Gideon Limes sat alone on the screened</p><p>porch of the Uneedsumfish Inn staring with </p><p>unseeing eyes out across that panorama. </p><p>It was the hour, above alt others, to fish. </p><p>By thousands the expiring flies settled to </p><p>the water and by scores the fish were feed- </p><p>ing. No need for description. You, fish- </p><p>ermen, need no words to breed the thrill at</p><p>memory of plopping, splashing trout as </p><p>they break evening water to feed, and you, </p><p>the uninitiated, explanation to you would </p><p>be meaningless. </p><p> Gideon Limes was aware of what tran-</p><p>spired, and yet no enthusiasm stirred in </p><p>him. Last night—another such an evening </p><p>—the Lunker had struck his fly, hung a </p><p>frantic moment, and tom loose, but even </p><p>the prospect of having the great fish on </p><p>again did not stir him. Life on the river </p><p>had lost its keen taste. </p><p> He could trace the reason back to the</p><p>hour of his departure, leaving the factory </p><p>under that stifling sense of being tied. For </p><p>years he had worked with a perfect office </p><p>staff; now it was ruined by a love affair </p><p>with a red-headed whipper-snapper. That </p><p>had made him irritable. His irritation, he </p><p>found, made inroads on his luck. </p><p>82 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> He did not have the necessary patience</p><p>to fish effectively. His companion rivals </p><p>picked on him, too, and he writhed under </p><p>their jibes, choosing now to sulk rather </p><p>than dominate by sheer bulk. Confound </p><p>love anyhow, he thought as his mind went </p><p>back again to the office. He stirred in his </p><p>chair, swinging the landing net he held to </p><p>relieve the rancor in his heart. </p><p> Footsteps, coming toward him; grasses</p><p>swishing against boots. He looked up and </p><p>could barely distinguish the figure of a </p><p>fellow camper. </p><p> “Gid! Oh, Gid!” the man called, and</p><p>he answered. “Hustle! Somebody’s got </p><p>your big fish on just below the bridge.” </p><p> Gideon’s discontent dissolved suddenly.</p><p>He slammed the screen door behind him </p><p>and waddled across the open. </p><p> “Who is it?” he called,.but the other, the</p><p>better runner, did not hear. </p><p> The pink had gone from the west. Just</p><p>a silvered sky remained, enabling the iden- </p><p>tification of figures, not of faces, and as </p><p>Gideon neared the stream he saw his four </p><p>companions moving along on his side, oilier </p><p>men across the water. </p><p> And in the river a man, thigh deep, ran</p><p>down the languid current in great, floun- </p><p>dering strides, heaping the black water into </p><p>phosphorescent mounds as he went. His </p><p>right hand held the straining rod and his </p><p>left paid out line swiftly as he followed the </p><p>rush of the fish he had hooked. As Gideon </p><p>came close and started following the course </p><p>of the river the man slowed his pace, grad- </p><p>ually dropping to a walk, giving out line </p><p>more eagerly, reducing his walk to a reluc- </p><p>tant edging along while the bamboo bent </p><p>and bowed mightily. </p><p> Then the tip of the rod vibrated and</p><p>writhed and a hundred feet below them </p><p>the water was ripped in a gleaming gash </p><p>as the frantic fish charged across toward </p><p>the other bank. Gideon Limes, standing </p><p>still, held his breath as in sympathetic </p><p>reaction he clamped his right hand and felt </p><p>the strain come to bear on the tackle. Then</p><p>gasped aloud as the fish broke water. </p><p> He burst through with a vigor which</p><p>told of superb strength, of splendid fury. </p><p>For an instant he was in silhouette against </p><p>the dead white sky full three feet in the </p><p>air, a wonderful water-creature taking to </p><p>an alien element in his battle for liberty. </p><p>Then, losing rigidity, the fish crashed back, </p><p>body slapping the surface with its full </p><p>length, sending out a shower as of new </p><p>silver coins to spatter for yards about. </p><p> And as he went under, the man took in</p><p>a length of line, quickly, deftly, careful not </p><p>to bring up slack too suddenly. The tip </p><p>of the rod bent and quivered again, dip- </p><p>ping low before the strain, stiffly pointing </p><p>out the direction of its quarry while the </p><p>man braced backward against the ripples, </p><p>breathing in a low grunt to attest to the </p><p>tug yonder. </p><p> Again the fish leaped; again he crashcd</p><p>down limply, as if to fall on the strand </p><p>which snared him and break with his </p><p>weight that which he could not part with </p><p>his pull. Again and again, until he had </p><p>displayed himself, a black blotch against </p><p>the western sky, six times. </p><p> Then change; the water quieted. The</p><p>rod stood straight out, springing lightly, </p><p>not an oimce of weight there. </p><p> “Gone, by heck!” some one cried.</p><p> “Gone, like-!” snorted Gideon Limes.</p><p>“Look!” </p><p> A ribbon of riffle showed, moving swiftly</p><p>up-stream. The man in the water watched </p><p>it go, watched it pass him, not a dozen feet </p><p>away, and all the time his reel ate slack </p><p>yard upon yard. He turned, following </p><p>with his eyes the trail of the moving line </p><p>until, he faced up-stream. Then com- </p><p>menced to walk, to run, leaning low against </p><p>the flow of water and when the trout did </p><p>strike resistance again his enemy was mov- </p><p>ing with him, putting the strain on leader, </p><p>line and rod gradually, carefully, skilfully, </p><p>so that when the splints were again doubled </p><p>and a-tremble the tension had come on </p><p>them easily, not of a sudden. </p><p> “Look out for those snags!” Gideon cried,</p><p>voice betraying his excitement. “Snags </p><p>and jams all along the other side!” </p><p> “Thanks.”</p><p> In an ordinary tone, quite coolly, the</p><p>response came from the other as he slowed </p><p>to a walk and worked in close against the </p><p>bank to put himself across the stream from </p><p>the trout, giving the necessary trifle of </p><p>slack and watching the moving flap of </p><p>water laid back by the ripping line as his </p><p>fish drove to and fro, laboring toward the </p><p>tangle of logs. </p><p> Man to fish, fish against man, fighting</p><p>that superb up-stream fight that the Ger- </p><p>man Brown makes. Giving, taking, each </p><p>wise in the ways of battle, the fish, close </p><p>to bottom in his three feet of water putting </p><p>A Fish Story About Love </p><p>83 </p><p>every ounce into the struggle toward safety </p><p>so near; the man, deft, collected, dis- </p><p>playing that fine repression of effort which </p><p>marks the master angler, countering move </p><p>with move, stealing a yard here, yielding </p><p>a foot there, scheming for a position that </p><p>would give him a cross-pull on the trout’s </p><p>head to hold it away from its objective. </p><p> “You’ll lose him; drag him out!” a man</p><p>across the stream advised. </p><p> “It’ll be my loss then,” evidently nettled</p><p>by suggestion from the clearly inexpert. </p><p> Yet the man gave, inch by inch, moving</p><p>forward a step, halting, bracing until it </p><p>seemed as though something must snap, </p><p>then surrendering another foot; but each </p><p>time he made that stand it was for a longer </p><p>duration. The back fin of the Brown </p><p>showed above the water within a yard of </p><p>the jam that offered shelter, where he could </p><p>tangle and break the leader. Another foot </p><p>the man granted, another hand’s breadth. </p><p> Minute after minute they fought, in</p><p>silence now for those who watched spoke </p><p>but rarely and then in hushed voices. Oc- </p><p>casionally the man in the stream grunted </p><p>or muttered an indistinguishable word. </p><p>The trout worked back and forth feverishly </p><p>and the man gave—when he did not want </p><p>to give—letting the creature wriggle closer </p><p>into the scant margin which was between </p><p>him and his haven. The zig-zags became </p><p>shorter, more frantic; he burrowed for </p><p>deeper water and the rod segment became </p><p>more acute. </p><p> Then, with a foot, perhaps, to spare, the</p><p>man braced himself on spread legs, leaned </p><p>backward and swung the tip of his rod </p><p>straight upward. It was the crisis and </p><p>Gideon Limes felt his heart slow with ap- </p><p>prehension. Would the tackle stop the </p><p>fish? Or would it set him free? </p><p> The man in the river strained with stilled</p><p>breathing. Pound by pound he applied the </p><p>upward pull, considerate of his tackle yet </p><p>risking all against the resistance of the </p><p>trout, risking it cautiously and wisely. </p><p>Deeper grew the dip of the tip. The slender </p><p>whip of bamboo bent clear to the grip, and</p><p>still the Brown withstood the drag, wrig- </p><p>gling sharply. </p><p>CAME the telling moment. The </p><p>rod vibrated, the line was taut and </p><p>still as though fast, finally, to the </p><p>snag itself. So for the space of a deliberate </p><p>breath, and with a hissing gasp of relief, </p><p>of triumph, the man was moving with the </p><p>river, for that last ounce had drawn the </p><p>fish to the surface, turned him over with a </p><p>flop and a cuff of the broad tail and headed </p><p>him with the flow, away from the dangerous </p><p>jams! </p><p> “Goo’ boy!” cried Gideon Limes, brand-</p><p>ishing the landing net and jogging along </p><p>through the grass to keep abreast. </p><p> For an interval the man sloshed through</p><p>the water, letting the fish go but holding </p><p>him just within control. They rounded an </p><p>easy bend, moving with the current. </p><p> “How’s the water below?” the man asked,</p><p>not turning his head. </p><p> “Jam clear across thirty rods down—</p><p>Shallow water—banks clear—look out for </p><p>hole to left—if he gets to that jam—water </p><p>awful deep-” </p><p> Information rained on him; and Gideon</p><p>Limes, panting in his effort to make through </p><p>the brush that now covered the banks, </p><p>dropped into the water, splashing along a </p><p>dozen yards behind the fisherman, forget- </p><p>ting the absence of his waders. </p><p> A whippoorwill sounded its lonely note.</p><p>A nighthawk “squnked” as it swooped close </p><p>over their heads. The gloom deepened; </p><p>but the afterglow, caught again and flung </p><p>upward by the water, let them see. </p><p> Below was down-timber, clear across the</p><p>stream. They could hear the laugh of the </p><p>water as it sported over that obstacle. </p><p>And the man with the fish began to slow </p><p>once more, by fine degrees, looking from </p><p>side to side, working out into mid-stream, </p><p>where the water reached his hips. </p><p> He was deliberate in action now, almost</p><p>hesitant, always underplaying. And before </p><p>the others realized, he had checked the </p><p>flight of his trout, was standing still, stooped</p><p>forward from the waist, resisting sturdily. </p><p> Again the fish leaped, not so high, not</p><p>with so much verve and display of strength </p><p>and again the man stole slack as he crashed </p><p>back on the water. He sulked, working </p><p>sluggishly over to the right bank. He </p><p>leaped again, and a third time. Sullen </p><p>thereafter, keeping close to the bank. </p><p> Then he turned and veered for the other</p><p>side. Back and across, again and again, </p><p>twisting the rod until he threatened to </p><p>wrench it to slivers. And to meet that </p><p>stress the man was again forced to move </p><p>on down, each step bringing the water </p><p>higher about him, to his waist—his </p><p>stomach—half-way to his armpits. </p><p>84 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> He stopped; still, and with indications</p><p>of finality. Below was deep water. Once </p><p>there, no tackle could hold that fish, so </p><p>again the man forced a crisis, lay back </p><p>against the current, lifted the tip of his </p><p>rod and applied that upward pull. </p><p> The trout showed a flash of his back, and</p><p>his tail flung into the air to smack the </p><p>water. Once more the dark hump, and </p><p>again the arc described by the tail time </p><p>after time, end over end, rolling like a hoop, </p><p>head chasing tail, tail flaying out in frantic </p><p>effort, the fish, in a hysteria of rage, strove </p><p>to break down the man’s strength. </p><p> It did not avail. In a flash he was speed-</p><p>ing up-stream. He reached the end of the </p><p>line, hesitated an instant and swept back </p><p>with the current. Then, across, then up </p><p>once more, that time near the other bank, </p><p>while the man, always facing his fish, took </p><p>in a foot at a time, satisfied to win slowly, </p><p>never yielding, now. </p><p> On the bank the watchers stood silent.</p><p>Jn the stream-Gideon Limes shivered un- </p><p>consciously from the night damp and let </p><p>mosquitoes feed on his fat neck without </p><p>protest. His mouth was dry, eyes aching </p><p>from the strain of following the fight. </p><p> “You got him now!” he rumbled and</p><p>when the other did not answer, repeated: </p><p>“You got him now. Here, let me help,” </p><p>waving the landing-net. </p><p> “Stay out! Watch!”</p><p> The other snapped out the words for the</p><p>fish had turned and, back-fin showing, </p><p>charged up the river. He went beyond </p><p>his captor. He passed Gideon. He swung </p><p>toward mid-current and Limes floundered, </p><p>stepping high as he felt the fine tighten </p><p>about his legs. Somehow he got free with- </p><p>out disaster, panting audibly. </p><p> “Now, if you can keep out of the way,”</p><p>the other said with stinging dispassionate- </p><p>ness, “I’ll try to land this fish.” </p><p> Gideon muttered something. He did not</p><p>know what. His thrill covered wholly his </p><p>humiliation.</p><p> Another quarter hour passed. The moon</p><p>was shining, silvering the stream, letting </p><p>them follow every tired move of the drown- </p><p>ing trout. Up and down, in short spas- </p><p>modic flights, devoid of sweep or power, </p><p>he went. Now and then his yellow belly </p><p>flashed as he turned on his side. At no </p><p>interval was he wholly submerged. Five </p><p>—ten minutes the man toyed with him so, </p><p>adding caution to caution. Then reeling </p><p>in slowly, confidently, leading the fish </p><p>gently about at his leader’s length, he </p><p>dipped his net and waded toward shore, </p><p>a dripping, glistening weight in the mesh. </p><p> “Holy smoke, what ai fish!” some one</p><p>cried. “Come on to the shack; let’s look </p><p>at him in tiie light.” </p><p> Fighting it over again, talking all at once,</p><p>they trailed across the misty flat toward </p><p>the Uneedsumfish Inn and in their wake </p><p>Gideon moved heavily. Reaction had set </p><p>in. For years he had dreamed of taking </p><p>that fish and now he realized that he never </p><p>could have taken him. It wasn’t in his </p><p>mind or body to fish as this man had fished. </p><p>He was not born to it. He remembered </p><p>the sharp rebuke, and suddenly he felt </p><p>quite inferior—inferior and depressed. </p><p> They were clustered about the lighted</p><p>lamp when he entered. In its glow lay </p><p>the great trout, wide-eyed, gasping. Bright </p><p>yellow was his belly, color deepening as </p><p>it swept up his goodly girth to his rich </p><p>brown back. The darker spots on him </p><p>were big, clearly cut and the red dots stood </p><p>out vividly from the more somber shadings </p><p>—a superb specimen, crowding thirty </p><p>inches, six firm pounds! Gideon’s little gray </p><p>eyes sparkled again as he gazed upon the </p><p>trout. Then he lifted that gaze to the </p><p>white, elated face of the stranger. </p><p> His jaw dropped. Incredulously he held</p><p>out a hand. </p><p> “Kirk!” he cried. “Kirk, my boy! When</p><p>the devil—how in—why-” </p><p> He pumped Washington’s hand and</p><p>looked about into the faces of the other </p><p>admirers with rising triumph. </p><p> “You’re friends?” one of his companions</p><p>asked, perhaps enviously. </p><p> “Friends”—drawing himself up—“why,</p><p>he’s my right-hand man in the office. By </p><p>the Lord Harry, it took somebody from </p><p>that office to show you fellas up, to let you </p><p>know what real fishing is.” </p><p> “His vacation, you see—” looking at the</p><p>youth, a peculiar flush on his own face— </p><p>“he’ll stay until my time’s up. We’ll go </p><p>back to work together.” </p><p> He slapjied Kirk on the shoulders.</p><p> “By the Lord Harry, boy, you’ve caught</p><p>my fish—and—” meeting the blue eyes— </p><p>“you’ve hooked something else of mine. </p><p>But there ’re as good fish in the Boardman </p><p>as?ever’ve been caught and that’s true of </p><p>everything—men, and women—stenogra- </p><p>phers and all those things.” </p><p>THE PEARL OF TORRES </p><p> hy Louis Esson.</p><p>WHEN Ted Jarrett, of New York </p><p>City, drifted into the pictur- </p><p>esque pearling village by Torres </p><p>Straits, the monotony of life had </p><p>just been relieved by a little shooting af- </p><p>fair. The chief actor was Leon Rod, a </p><p>jewel-buyer, who traveled between Thurs- </p><p>day Island and the scattered villages on the </p><p>coast,1 engaging divers, arranging outfits and </p><p>occasionally buying pearls. He had engaged </p><p>two Malays, Muda and Tuah, as divers for </p><p>one of the big fleet owners; but when they </p><p>had signed the contract, and each received </p><p>ten pounds in advance, they formed the </p><p>plan to slip away to the Aroe Islands, in </p><p>Dutch waters, that had not been fished so </p><p>much as Torres Straits. </p><p> This simple scheme miscarried, because</p><p>one night the Malays got so gloriously </p><p>drunk and talkative, that they let out their </p><p>secret.^ “Big” Bailey, the police constable, </p><p>arrested the culprits, and locked them up </p><p>in the ramshackle jail. The Malays </p><p>promptly escaped, and vtent to interview </p><p>Rod, who was smoking a cigar on the hotel </p><p>veranda. In the midst of their vociferous </p><p>explanations, Rod suddenly drew a revolver </p><p>and fired. Tuah fell, shot through the </p><p>heart, and Muda, with a scream, dashed </p><p>down the street and disappeared. When a </p><p>crowd gathered ’round the dead body of-the </p><p>Malay, Rod was quietly smoking a cigar. </p><p> “It was his own fault,” he said indif-</p><p>ferently. </p><p> Ted Jarrett entered the little shanty, a</p><p>wooden building, with a galvanized iron </p><p>roof, known by the grandiloquent title of the </p><p>Cape York Hotel, just in time to pick up the </p><p>tag end of the story. Rod, who was angry </p><p>85 </p><p>at losing his commission, declared that the </p><p>Malays had run amok. Muda had not been </p><p>seen since. He might have been in hiding, </p><p>meditating revenge, or perhaps he had </p><p>slipped away to the Aroe Islands after all. </p><p> The American ordered drinks for the</p><p>crowd. The girl serving behind the bar was </p><p>a French girl from San Francisco, and Ted </p><p>wondered how she came to be there in such</p><p>strange surroundings, for there is no more </p><p>cosmopolitan crowd on earth than the </p><p>pearlers of Torres Straits. </p><p> A smiling Chinese handed ’round the</p><p>drinks. </p><p> “Good luck!” cried the pearlers, draining</p><p>their glasses. </p><p> “Good luck!” said Jarrett.</p><p> In the bar-room were many races of</p><p>white men, Anglo-Saxons, Danes, Russians, </p><p>and different varieties of Southern Euro- </p><p>peans; while in the streets could be found </p><p>Chinese, Japanese, Indian Mohammedans, </p><p>Singhalese, Malays, Kanakas, Filipinos, </p><p>Australian blacks, and various nondescripts, </p><p>white, brown, black, yellow, and every </p><p>shade between. </p><p> Pearling is a fascinating pursuit, and</p><p>draws adventurers from the ends of the </p><p>earth. </p><p> It had drawn Ted Jarrett from a lawyer’s</p><p>office in New York City, and cast him into </p><p>the Outer Spaces. Ted was twenty-five </p><p>years old, and already had been twice ’round </p><p>the world; but each time, on his return, his </p><p>father gave him good sensible advice, and </p><p>sent him back to the heavy law books which </p><p>he detested. Ted knew he would never cut </p><p>much of a figure in the legal profession, so, </p><p>on his father’s death, three years before, he </p><p>86 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>abandoned office work, and spent most of </p><p>the little fortune he had inherited in a trade </p><p>enterprise in Mexico. But his heart was </p><p>not in the business, and lie sold out at a loss. </p><p> Ted was a big strong, athletic young man,</p><p>well educated and full of energy; but too </p><p>good-natured to be a lawyer, and too easy </p><p>going to make a successful merchant. So </p><p>far he had failed in everything; and Evelyn </p><p>Ward, a young society beauty with whom </p><p>he thought he was in love, told him, one </p><p>Summer’s evening, after dinner at a stylish </p><p>Broadway restaurant, that, unless he turned </p><p>over a new leaf, and made a success of </p><p>something, his attentions would be no longer </p><p>welcome. </p><p> Ted’s face took on a sterner outline.</p><p> “I suppose you think I’m a failure?” he</p><p>said. </p><p> The girl shrugged her shoulders.</p><p> “What else can I think? One can’t live</p><p>on romantic dreams.” </p><p> “I was foolish enough to think that we</p><p>could,” Ted replied, with a dry laugh. </p><p> When they finally parted that night, Ted</p><p>had already made his plans, though Evelyn </p><p>had given him no definite promise. She </p><p>would never marry a poor man, for it </p><p>needed money, and plenty of money, to give </p><p>her the only life she cared about, the gay and </p><p>brilliant life of New York society. If he </p><p>failed there was no more to be said; and if </p><p>he succeeded, well, he might take his chance </p><p>with the rest of her admirers. </p><p> Next day Ted put his affairs in order, and</p><p>with a steamer ticket and a few thousand </p><p>dollars in his pocket, caught the train for </p><p>Frisco, where lie meant to set out to seek </p><p>his fortune in the islands of the South. </p><p> For some months he knocked ’round the</p><p>islands, making little more money than he </p><p>spent, but enjoying life in his usual light- </p><p>hearted way; but one night at Suva, in the </p><p>club, he met a man who told him of the </p><p>pearling at Torres Straits, and his imagina- </p><p>tion was so kindled that lie caught the next</p><p>boat for Sydney, and from there went </p><p>north, past the Great Barrier Reef, to </p><p>Thursday Island. A few days later he went </p><p>over to the mainland, determined to fit out </p><p>a lugger and reap a rich harvest of pearls. </p><p> In the Cape York Hotel there was much</p><p>talk of sudden strokes of fortune, good and </p><p>evil, of thieving divers, of the fatuity of </p><p>politicians, and of the sin, sweat, and sorrow </p><p>of that particular torrid township. </p><p> The conversation like the crowd, was</p><p>mixed; but Jarrett soon got his bearings. </p><p> He learned that, on an average, the shell</p><p>was as profitable as the pearls; but every </p><p>man who went out in a lugger clung to the </p><p>hope that some unusually line pearls would </p><p>fall to his lot. It was always the pearl that </p><p>might be, not the shell that was, that at- </p><p>tracted adventurous fieet-owners. </p><p> A Dutchman, from Java, and an Italian</p><p>had a heated argument about the respective </p><p>merits of the Aroe Islands and Torres </p><p>Straits. A good case was made for both </p><p>sides; but an old Queensland pearler main- </p><p>tained that the Torres shell was the best hi </p><p>the world. </p><p> “That will do for me, then,” said Jarrett.</p><p> “But it’s harder to find,” remarked the</p><p>jewel-buyer. </p><p> “All the more fun,” replied the young</p><p>American. </p><p> Li, the stolid Chinese “boy” kept carry-</p><p>ing ’round the drinks. </p><p> The girl behind the bar, who was called</p><p>Suzette, seemed to Ted much too delicate a </p><p>picture for such a rough-set frame. She </p><p>had an expressive face, a clear skin tinted a </p><p>delicate olive by the sun, eyes soft and </p><p>brown, but with a merry laugh in them, and </p><p>a great mass of blue-black hair. Her figure </p><p>was slight and graceful; and Ted could not </p><p>help noticing the good taste of her dress, a </p><p>simple frock of some dark, semi-transparent </p><p>material, suitable for the tropics, but with a </p><p>touch of coquetry in its scarlet belt that </p><p>matched the red flower in her hair. </p><p> Leon Rod, a handsome middle-aged man</p><p>of unknown nationality—he might have </p><p>been anything, for he had traveled the </p><p>world, and spoke several languages fluently </p><p>—sat at a little table sipping a liqueur. He </p><p>raised his glass to Suzette. </p><p> “A tes beaux yeuxl”</p><p> Suzette wrinkled her dainty little nose.</p><p> Rod walked over to the bar, caught her</p><p>wrist, and whispered something in French. </p><p>Suzette’s cheeks blazed with shame and in- </p><p>dignation. Rod laughed, and bent over to </p><p>kiss her, when Ted Jarrett grabbed him by </p><p>the shoulders, wheeled him ’round, and then </p><p>pushed him violently to the door. Rod was </p><p>a heavy and powerful man, but he was </p><p>taken by surprise by the American’s quick- </p><p>ness and dexterity. </p><p> The crowd laughed at the little incident;</p><p>but as Leon Rod stumbled out of the door </p><p>on to the veranda, a revolver shot passed </p><p>just over his shoulder and buried itself in </p><p>The Pearl of Torres </p><p>87 </p><p>the wall. There was a rush to the door. </p><p> “It was Muda,” cried Big Bailey, the</p><p>constable, “having a crack at Rod.” </p><p> There was a scene of disorder. Suzette</p><p>was forgotten. The pearlers ran in different </p><p>directions, but there was no sign of the </p><p>Malay. Muda had escaped again. </p><p>THE lugger was drifting across </p><p>the glittering Straits. </p><p> Ted Jarrett was now a full-blown</p><p>pearler. It was a day of perfect beauty, </p><p>and the thrill of the tropics fired his blood. </p><p>Pearling, he thought, was a splendid game. </p><p>His money had gone, but what of that? A </p><p>good haul of shell would pay all expenses, </p><p>and the pearls he found would be clear </p><p>profit. </p><p> He had leased the foreshore from a more</p><p>or less paternal Government, and used the </p><p>site for his own shack, a shell shed, and a </p><p>place for overhauling his boats. </p><p> Ted felt rather pleased with himself.</p><p>But what would Evelyn think, he won- </p><p>dered, if she saw him in such a place, and in </p><p>such a costume. It would be difficult to </p><p>turn him into a society man again. He </p><p>loved adventure, untamed lands, tropic </p><p>seas, strange people, and the big, vague </p><p>dreams of the wanderer. Had he the soul </p><p>of a beach-comber, after all? </p><p> This, he bad to admit, was the life that</p><p>suited him, and though his financial position </p><p>was not exactly rosy, he was in excellent </p><p>health and spirits. His lugger was not yet </p><p>fully paid up, and he was depending on a </p><p>haul to clear himself; but he was a born </p><p>adventurer, undaunted by circumstances, </p><p>and buoyed up by the hopes of youth. </p><p> Ted reveled in the pearling. His lugger,</p><p>fitted up with a dingey, pump, and diving- </p><p>gear, had a small but resourceful crew. He </p><p>was proud of Utimaro, a little Jap, who was </p><p>one of the most daring divers of Torres </p><p>Straits. Though slightly built, Utimaro </p><p>was strong and sinewy, and there was no </p><p>question of his skill and courage. He was </p><p>absolutely cold-blooded, and if the prospects</p><p>were good, there was no risk he would re- </p><p>fuse to take. He was a silent little man, </p><p>more respected than loved by the rest of the </p><p>crew. Why he had offered him his services </p><p>at a moderate wage was a mystery to </p><p>Jarrett. </p><p> Besides Utimaro there was another Jap,</p><p>Sato, the “tender,” whose job it was to </p><p>answer the diver’s signals, and keep the </p><p>pipes and ropes free while he was under </p><p>water. Malays kept the pumps going, </p><p>and the fifth man, a Levantine Greek, </p><p>who was no diver, acted as cook and general </p><p>handy man. </p><p> The divers had struck a good patch of</p><p>shell. Utimaro returned from the bottom </p><p>of the sea with his bag filled, and sat for a </p><p>moment enjoying the fresh breeze. One of </p><p>the Malays then stepped into the diving- </p><p>dress and was lowered down. </p><p> Ted had admired the diving of Utimaro,</p><p>and his eyes still followed the little man, who </p><p>went aft to the pile of shells. He noticed </p><p>the Jap had a piece of wire which he slipped </p><p>away quickly as Ted crossed over. </p><p> “What’s that, Utimaro?”</p><p> The Jap looked up with a scowl.</p><p> “What’s the game?”</p><p> The Jap did not reply.</p><p> Ted looked at the shells, and found that</p><p>some had been stacked on edge in the sun, so </p><p>that the oyster would open easily, and allow </p><p>a big pearl to be fished for with a piece of </p><p>wire. This was a favorite device with the </p><p>colored divers, who have a good eye for an </p><p>oyster likely to contain a pearl. </p><p> “That’ll do, Utimaro,” said Ted, “I’ll</p><p>open the rest myself.” </p><p> Now he knew why Utimaro had been so</p><p>willing to work for him. Ted was a new </p><p>man at the game. </p><p> “Utimaro!” called one of the Malays.</p><p> It was again the Jap’s turn to dive.</p><p> Utimaro looked over the ship’s side.</p><p> “Too deep,” he muttered at last, “it is not</p><p>the law.” </p><p> There is a law against diving below a cer-</p><p>tain depth; but Utimaro had never been </p><p>known to refuse before. His obvious in- </p><p>tention was to pay Jarrett back for discover- </p><p>ing his tampering with the shells. </p><p> “This is your last chance, Utimaro. If</p><p>you quit now, you’ll have to find another </p><p>job.” But the Jap would not dive. </p><p> The shell was so good, that Ted Jarrett</p><p>determined on going down himself. He had </p><p>full confidence in his crew, and knew the </p><p>Malays would keep an eye on Utimaro. </p><p>When he got into the dress, and the heavy </p><p>helmet was screwed on, he felt far from </p><p>comfortable. His cars buzzed; then he </p><p>heard a loud bang, caused by the com- </p><p>pressed air striking his ear-drums. But </p><p>Ted, who had no thought of consequences, </p><p>was going to see it through. He stepped </p><p>down the ladder attached to the side of the </p><p>88 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>boat, and then cast himself off. He went </p><p>down to the bottom by the plumper which, </p><p>along with the life-line, was held by the </p><p>silent Japanese bender. </p><p> When he reached the floor of the ocean,</p><p>Ted was dazzled by the enchantment of the </p><p>scene, that looked as beautiful and unreal </p><p>as a fairy palace. He saw the most ex- </p><p>quisite shells, of every shape and color, </p><p>trees made out of coral, delicate fishes flash- </p><p>ing among the marine growths, curious </p><p>flowers and ferns of the sea. But he had no </p><p>time to indulge his sense of wonder. He </p><p>kept his eyes fixed on one object only—shell. </p><p> Overhead the lugger drifted, dragging him</p><p>on, and quickly he gathered the large oys- </p><p>ters, and dropped them into his bag. Uti- </p><p>maro was right, they had certainly struck a </p><p>patch. Ted filled his bag, gave the signal </p><p>to be hauled up, and rose quickly to the sur- </p><p>face. Sato unscrewed the helmet; and Ted </p><p>sat down exhausted, eagerly filling his lungs </p><p>with the fresh air. Utimaro did not speak; </p><p>but the Malays grinned, for the young </p><p>American’s grit bad impressed them. </p><p> Ted gave the word to return home, lay</p><p>back exhausted on the deck, and lit his pipe. </p><p> The lugger danced over the waves.</p><p> It was a day for dreams. In the drowsy</p><p>tropic afternoon the scene was a picture of </p><p>delight, with the burning blue of the sea </p><p>and sky, the red beach at the foot of the </p><p>cliffs, and the white roofs of the houses </p><p>peeping amid the vivid green foliage of the </p><p>coconut, poinciana, and the palm trees. </p><p>The air was warm, but a light breeze blew </p><p>across the sea. </p><p> Ted sat up. For some weeks luck had</p><p>gone against him. There was not a pearl in </p><p>every shell, Ted soon discovered, nor in </p><p>every hundred shells. It was a gamble, but </p><p>the lure was irresistible. Now he had dis- </p><p>covered Utimaro’s trick, his prospects </p><p>seemed brighter. At any moment a man </p><p>might make a fortune. </p><p> With a flat, thin-bladed knife, he started</p><p>on the shells he had just dived for himself. </p><p>The opening of every oyster was an exciting</p><p>experiment. </p><p> Quickly he opened shell after shell, put-</p><p>ting any gems he found into a little tin box. </p><p> He had suffered many disappointments.</p><p>At first he thought that every oyster con- </p><p>tained a pearl of some kind, and he mistook </p><p>every bright bubble for one. Often he </p><p>thought it was real till the knife proved his </p><p>error—the bubble burst. </p><p> The little box was half-filled with pearls,</p><p>mostly baroques, ill-shaped gems of com- </p><p>paratively small value, yet serving to en- </p><p>courage the hope that the rare pearl, </p><p>Evelyn’s pearl, might yet be found. </p><p> As he opened shell after shell, finding</p><p>only a bubble or a baroque, he would just </p><p>curse, and tackle another pile. </p><p> “Better luck next time,” he would say.</p><p> As the lugger was nearing the shore, he</p><p>picked up a big oyster, inserted his knife at </p><p>the “lip” of the shell, and cut through the </p><p>strong central muscle that bound the flat </p><p>and round sides together. His knife </p><p>touched something that made his heart </p><p>jump with excitement. </p><p> It was a beautiful pearl. It was big, per-</p><p>fectly round, with a smooth skin and deli- </p><p>cate iridescent luster. Ted could hardly </p><p>believe his eyes, for never Ijefore had he </p><p>seen anything like it. There was no pearl </p><p>to match it in the gem-shops of Thursday </p><p>Island. What was the worth of that little </p><p>sphere of nacre? Ted examined it care- </p><p>fully. Who could say? A fine pearl is like </p><p>a fine picture, it is something unique, be- </p><p>yond price, it becomes a matter of fancy, </p><p>of artistic taste. Well, if it were sold for </p><p>twenty, twenty-five, thirty thousand dol- </p><p>lars, Ted thought it would be cheap. </p><p> But he had no intention of selling this</p><p>pearl. He had worked for it, he had crossed </p><p>the world to find it, he had dived for it him- </p><p>self, and he felt proud of his efforts. </p><p> Utimaro stood unobserved 1x2hind him.</p><p> When Ted looked up the Jap was point-</p><p>ing to the little jetty the lugger was ap- </p><p>proaching. </p><p> “At last,” Ted reflected, “I have some-</p><p>thing to show, a perfect pearl, a queen of </p><p>gems, worthy to hang as a pendant on the </p><p>white throat of a New York beauty.” </p><p> The lugger touched the jetty.</p><p> Ted hid the pearl in his belt.</p><p> I NEXT evening as the moon was</p><p>rising, Ted Jarrett stepped out </p><p>of his shack, and ran down the </p><p>beach for a swim. </p><p> He told nobody of the precious pearl he</p><p>had found, and he thought nobody knew. </p><p>Before going down to the sea, he looked </p><p>carefully ’round the shack, and slipped the </p><p>little leather bag, containing the pearl, </p><p>into a hole in the wall. </p><p> As he was enjoying liis swim, Sato, the</p><p>Japanese tender approached, and, when </p><p>The Pearl of Torres </p><p>89 </p><p>Ted came out of the water, banded him a </p><p>note. It came from New York, and he </p><p>recognized Evelyn’s handwriting. </p><p> As he hastily dressed he was surprised to</p><p>find how slightly moved he was. New </p><p>York, was very far away, and somehow the </p><p>lights of Broadway were less alluring than </p><p>the moonlight on the lonely sea. </p><p> He tore open the letter, glanced at it</p><p>hastily, and was about to return when </p><p>Sato, who had been waiting patiently, </p><p>asked him a question about the lugger. </p><p> While he was reading the letter from New</p><p>York, and giving Sato some directions for </p><p>the next day, a small brown figure, which </p><p>had been hiding behind the low bushes at </p><p>the foot of the cliff, crept into the shack. </p><p>It was Utimaro. He went straight to the </p><p>hole in the wall, opened the bag, and took </p><p>out the pearl, and then glided off into the </p><p>bushes like a snake into its hole. He </p><p>wriggled along the sands till he reached the </p><p>cliff, scrambled up the jagged rocks and </p><p>disappeared. </p><p> Dismissing Sato, Jarrett, with the letter</p><p>in his hand, returtied slowly and thought- </p><p>fully to the shack. </p><p> He threw himself into a low chair, and,</p><p>while the kettle was lx&gt;iling, he again read </p><p>Evelyn’s brief note. It destroyed his last </p><p>illusions about her. She took it for granted </p><p>that he was a failure as usual, and would </p><p>never make a success of pearling. Shell </p><p>had fallen a hundred dollars a ton—she had </p><p>made inquiries. She would be pleased </p><p>with a pearl from Torres, if it were a fine </p><p>one; but fine pearls were rare, and fortune </p><p>was not likely to favor him. </p><p> Her light chatter of automobiles, dances</p><p>and supper parties, and the artificial plea- </p><p>sures that could be bought by wealth, </p><p>jarred on the young man, who saw clearly </p><p>that she was more interested in Ms fortune </p><p>than in himself. The pearl he had striven </p><p>for, surely it was never destined for such a </p><p>cold and calculating woman! </p><p> As he sat, dreaming for hours in the tropic</p><p>night, he realized how strangely satisfied he</p><p>was with his lot. He liked the life, and the </p><p>motley, adventurous crowd that gathered o’ </p><p>nights in the little shanty. Suzette, who </p><p>was treated by the pearlers with a rough, </p><p>but genuine courtesy, seemed to take no </p><p>special notice of him. After the incident </p><p>with Rod, he felt rather shy in her presence, </p><p>keeping somewhat aloof, with a chivalrous </p><p>care not to presume on her gratitude. </p><p> He often wondered at her refinement, but</p><p>he learned that she was the daughter of a </p><p>cultured man, though a ne’er-do-well, a </p><p>French engineer, who had traveled the </p><p>world seeking his fortune, and at last come </p><p>to Thursday Island. Later he crossed to </p><p>Cape York, and opened the little hotel, </p><p>though most of his time he spent pearling. </p><p>One night his lugger went out, but it never </p><p>returned. That was two years ago. Su- </p><p>zette kept on the shanty, saving her little </p><p>money, so that she could return to her </p><p>mother’s people in San Francisco. </p><p> She was quite unlike the selfish, super-</p><p>ficial Evelyn. She had known suffering; </p><p>that was part of her charm. The diamond </p><p>is struck from the hard inanimate rock, but </p><p>the pearl is born of pain—that was the dif- </p><p>ference between them. The New York girl </p><p>was hard, cold, brilliant, a society beauty— </p><p>a diamond; Suzette was soft and subtle, one </p><p>who had known suffering, but with a depth </p><p>of color, a delicate enchantment—a pearl. </p><p> “Yes, a pearl,” he reflected, “the pearl of</p><p>Torres.” </p><p>IT WAS a quiet time in the Cape </p><p>York Hotel. Suzette was sitting in </p><p>a rocking-chair, pensively knitting, </p><p>when Leon Rod came in. He seemed </p><p>greatly excited. </p><p> “Wine, Suzette,” he cried, “I must</p><p>drink.” </p><p> Suzette rose, and brought a small bottle</p><p>of champagne. The wine sparkled gaily in </p><p>the glass. As he lifted it to his lips, be </p><p>gazed boldly at Suzette, who flushed and </p><p>walked away. </p><p> Leon Rod laughed, drained his glass, and</p><p>called for more wine. </p><p> “I have good news,” he said, “good news,</p><p>cherie."</p><p> When Suzette brought another bottle he</p><p>leaned across the table and spoke eagerly. </p><p> “Listen! At last fortune lias been kind</p><p>to me. I am going to leave this infernal </p><p>country. I have seen enough, too much. </p><p>What have we here—fever, heat, flies, dirt </p><p>—and as for the people, they’re the very </p><p>scum of the earth. Bah! It’s a terrible </p><p>life. But I’m through with it, do you hear, </p><p>Suzette? I have my fortune, and now </p><p>I go.” </p><p> Suzette watched him closely.</p><p> “You have been buying pearls?” she</p><p>asked. </p><p> “Mais oui. I have bought pearls.”</p><p>90 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Where have they come from? The</p><p>American has found very few.” </p><p> Leon Rod lit a cigaret.</p><p> “He has found very few,” he laughed.</p><p>“That is so.” </p><p> “You are much cleverer,” said Suzette,</p><p>moving away. </p><p> “I am not a shell-hunter, I am a con-</p><p>noisseur.” </p><p> The jewel expert brought out a little case</p><p>from Ins pocket. He opened it, and Suzette </p><p>saw it was filled with a choice collection of </p><p>gems. </p><p> “I am an expert,” he said, “These pearls</p><p>are small, but very fine. Would they not </p><p>make a pretty necklace, Suzette?” </p><p> Rod was in an eager, amorous mood, and</p><p>Suzette became curious as to his designs. </p><p> “What are you going to do with the</p><p>pearls?” the girl asked. </p><p> “I will sell them at the right time.”</p><p> “Here?”</p><p> “No! In the best market, London, Paris,</p><p>New York. I have done with Torres. </p><p>How I have suffered in this hell-hole! And </p><p>you must have suffered too, Suzette. But </p><p>tomorrow I sail away. Singapore, Co- </p><p>lombo, Port Said, Marseilles, and then </p><p>Paris, Paris—the boulevards, the theaters, </p><p>the cafes—Paris; think of that, think what </p><p>Paris means to a man of wealth! That will </p><p>be my life. Will you come with me?” </p><p> The girl’s eyes flashed.</p><p> “The wine has gone to your head, m’sieu.”</p><p>“It is not the wine, it is you, ma belle. </p><p>Do you know Utimaro?” </p><p> “Oui, m’sieu.”</p><p> “He, too, is one of my agents. I have</p><p>fooled the American.” </p><p> Suzette trembled.</p><p> “Come, let us have a glass together!” said</p><p>Rod. </p><p> Suzette hesitated a moment. Since the</p><p>night Ted Jarrett had defended her, she had </p><p>thought only of him; but her love was hid- </p><p>den deep in her heart like a pearl in the sea. </p><p>She felt that it was hopeless; yet now he was </p><p>being cheated, she would risk anything to </p><p>find out Rod’s schemes. </p><p> Setting her teeth tight she brought a large</p><p>bottle of champagne, and a glass for herself. </p><p>She sat down at the little table opposite </p><p>Leon Rod, who filled both glasses with the </p><p>sparkling wine. Suzette touched the glass </p><p>with her lips. </p><p> “Tell me about it,” she said. “It must</p><p>be amusing. You are not drinking.” </p><p> Rod raised his glass.</p><p> “Gem-buying is an art,” he replied,</p><p>jocosely. “It is much better than fitting </p><p>out a lugger. I have the choice of the spoil </p><p>from many luggers, and I buy very cheap, </p><p>not always from the fleet owners, you may </p><p>be sure. It is a dangerous game, now Big </p><p>Bailey is on the lookout, but I have a little </p><p>arrangement with the best of the colored </p><p>divers.” </p><p> “Ah, that is how you manage,” said Su-</p><p>zette, with a little jerky laugh, as she re- </p><p>filled his glass. </p><p> “Mais oui I love you, Suzette.” Leon</p><p>Rod leaned over the table trying to grasp </p><p>the girl’s hand. “Tonight I am going to </p><p>buy one more pearl, the finest of all.” </p><p> “Who found it?” she asked.</p><p> Leon Rod winked knowingly.</p><p> “Utimaro. He stole it from the Ameri-</p><p>can.” Rod, who was now flushed with </p><p>wine, whispered confidentially, “I shall meet </p><p>Utimaro on the beach, when I get the word </p><p>from Sato.” </p><p> “Is it a very fine pearl?” the girl inquired</p><p>innocently. </p><p> “It is perfect. I saw it only for a mo-</p><p>ment, for the Jap would not hand it over till</p><p>he got the money.” </p><p> “Will you have to pay him a great</p><p>deal?” </p><p> “No. How else can he sell it? The</p><p>Chinese store-keepers would know it was </p><p>stolen, and give him little, and nobody else </p><p>dares to buy from the colored divers. They </p><p>all have to come to Leon Rod. I am the </p><p>friend of the poor.” </p><p> Suzette was shivering with excitement,</p><p>but she kept filling Rod’s glass. </p><p> “You will come with me,” he cried, “you</p><p>will voyage as my wife. We will lead the </p><p>gay life, ah, Paris, Paris!” </p><p> At this moment Sato came in, handed</p><p>Rod a slip of paper, and then silently went </p><p>out. Rod’s eyes gleamed. </p><p> “Let me see!” cried Suzette.</p><p> Rod laughingly showed her the note,</p><p>which was in code. </p><p> Some of the pearlers were now entering,</p><p>and Suzette put away the champagne </p><p>glasses. The men called for drinks and cards. </p><p> Leon Rod looked at his watch, and pulled</p><p>himself together with a start. He rose, </p><p>crumpling the note in his hand, and bowed </p><p>to Suzette. </p><p> “A demain," he said significantly, as he</p><p>left the room. </p><p>The Pearl of Torres </p><p>9i </p><p> At once Suzette called Li, the Chinese</p><p>“boy,” told him to look after the place, and </p><p>then, without pausing to slip a shawl over </p><p>her head, she left the shanty, and walked </p><p>quickly to the beach. </p><p>“THE PEARL of Torres,” mur- </p><p>mured Ted softly. </p><p>His long reverie was interrupted by </p><p>a cry from Suzette. With loosened hair, </p><p>and sparkling eyes, she told her story, rapidly </p><p>but clearly, her pale hands flashing to and </p><p>fro in pretty and expressive gestures. </p><p> Jarrett listened" intently.</p><p> “But I have the pearl!” he cried.</p><p> Suzette looked surprised.</p><p> “Here it is,” he said, taking the bag from</p><p>its hiding-place. He opened it and started. </p><p>The pearl was gone. </p><p> “It is stolen!” cried Suzette.</p><p> The young American smiled grimly. So</p><p>Utimaro had been spying on him! But he </p><p>would recover that stolen pearl, for it meant </p><p>something to him—now. He looked at the </p><p>little French girl in admiration. </p><p> “Why have you done all this for me?”</p><p> Suzette seemed agitated.</p><p> “I must go, m’sieu.”</p><p> As they were speaking they caught sight</p><p>of a small figure, gliding along the beach. </p><p>Jarrett made a sudden move. </p><p> “Be careful,” whispered Suzette.</p><p> “I’ll see who it is,” said Ted, “I want that</p><p>pearl.” </p><p> “Keep to the cliff,” said Suzette, as she</p><p>hurried away, “adieu." </p><p> Ted Jarrett was too excited to notice how</p><p>she slipped off. Fixing his eyes on the small </p><p>brown figure whose movements were so sus- </p><p>picious, he kept to the cliff, walking behind</p><p>the bushes. The man, who was creeping </p><p>along the beach below, by a familiar gesture </p><p>revealed himself to Jarrett as the diver, </p><p>Utimaro. </p><p> It was before a cave in the rocks that</p><p>Utimaro stopped, and looked ’round. In a </p><p>few minutes he was joined by another man, </p><p>sauntering leisurely along, and smoking a </p><p>fragrant cigar. It was Leon Rod. </p><p> From his vantage ground on the cliff Ted</p><p>Jarrett could see them distinctly. Care- </p><p>fully he approached nearer, hiding behind </p><p>some rocks and bushes, till he hung straight </p><p>over the precipice. The men had entered </p><p>the cave, and were sitting on a boulder. </p><p>For some time they looked closely at each </p><p>other, but at last Utimaro displayed the </p><p> jewel, and handed it over to the illicit</p><p> buyer. Rod talked volubly, offering a</p><p> price; but the face of the Jap was set and</p><p> stern.</p><p> “It will not do,” he said.</p><p> “But let me explain, Utimaro-”</p><p> “No explanation.”</p><p> Rod held up the pearl.</p><p> “It is big, and has a good skin, that I ad-</p><p> mit—but it is not perfect. I am an ex-</p><p> pert.”</p><p> “I, too,” said the Jap, with a scowl.</p><p> “My best price is one hundred pounds.”</p><p> “Five,” snapped the Jap.</p><p> “Impossible, my friend, impossible.”</p><p> Utimaro remained silent. Then he held</p><p> out his hand.</p><p> “Give me the pearl. I no sell.”</p><p> Rod put it in his pocket.</p><p> “Listen, Utimaro,” he said, holding out a</p><p> bank note, “take your money.”</p><p> “No! I will have the pearl. It is</p><p> mine.”</p><p> “Listen!”</p><p> The Jap rose quietly.</p><p> “We talk no more,” he said.</p><p> Rod knocked the ash from his cigar.</p><p> “The pearl!” cried Utimaro, making a</p><p> spring; but Rod was too quick for him,</p><p> his hand was on his automatic and he</p><p> fired.</p><p> Utimaro fell against the boulder, blood</p><p> spurting from his throat.</p><p> When Rod saw that Utimaro was dead, he</p><p> left the body where it fell, and stepped</p><p> quickly out of the cave. He threw the in-</p><p> criminating weapon far into the sea, and set</p><p> out along the sand.</p><p> Jarrett followed, and as the beach made a</p><p> sudden curve about a quarter of a mile from</p><p> the cave, he swung himself over the edge of</p><p> the cliff, and dropped lighdy on to the</p><p> sand. Rod started as Jarrett met him face</p><p> to face.</p><p> “What do you want?” he cried angrily.</p><p> “My pearl,” said Jarrett.</p><p> Rod, who though slower in movement was</p><p> the heavier man, closed with him, and to-</p><p> gether they swayed backward and forward,</p><p> each trying in vain for a successful throw.</p><p> At last Jarrett broke away, and met his</p><p> opponent’s rush with a straight left. Some</p><p> blows were exchanged; and then Jarrett,</p><p> making a feint, tempted Rod to smash in</p><p> a heavy right; but the blow fell short, and</p><p> Jarrett, making the most of his chance</p><p> landed a well-timed hook on the point of the</p><p>92 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>jaw. The big man staggered and fell </p><p>heavily. </p><p> Jarrett waited for him to rise, but Rod</p><p>did not move. His eyes were shut, and </p><p>Jarrett thought it was a knock-out blow. </p><p>As he bent over and took the jewel from </p><p>Rod’s pocket, suddenly a knife flashed in his </p><p>face, gashing his forehead. It was a treach- </p><p>erous blow, but the ruse succeeded. Rod </p><p>cautiously raised himself, and picked up the </p><p>fatal pearl. </p><p> Jarrett lay helpless on the sands, and then</p><p>lost consciousness. </p><p>BACK IN the shanty Suzette be- </p><p>came impatient. The American </p><p>had not returned. She confided </p><p>her fears to Big Bailey, the police officer, </p><p>who immediately made ready for action. </p><p> “I’ve had my eye on Rod for some time,”</p><p>he said. “This ilhcit pearl buying is turn- </p><p>ing too many good divers into thieves, and </p><p>ruining the industry.” </p><p> “I’ll go with you,” said Suzette.</p><p> “Come along, then,” he growled, in a</p><p>bluff, good-natured way. </p><p> They left the pearlers drinking and play-</p><p>ing cards, slipped out quietly, and made for </p><p>the beach. </p><p> As they reached the cliffs they were</p><p>startled by the splendor of the tropic moon- </p><p>light that bathed the lonely sea and shore in </p><p>brilliant light. The night was soft, but as </p><p>dear as day, and every object could be </p><p>plainly distinguished. Suzette uttered a </p><p>little cry, her heart beating fast. On the </p><p>sands two figures had been struggling. She </p><p>recognized Ted Jarrett, the young Ameri- </p><p>can, and Leon Rod, kneeling beside the </p><p>body. </p><p> Rod picked up the pearl, and then rose</p><p>and walked quickly along the beach. But </p><p>he did not go far. A little boat touched the </p><p>shore. A dark figure rushed out, came be- </p><p>hind Rod, and plunged a kris between his </p><p>shoulder blades. Rod fell forward on the </p><p>sand and stirred no more.</p><p> It was a weird scene.</p><p> “Quick!” cried Suzette.</p><p> As they stood on the cliff, the dark figure</p><p>made for the sea. It was Muda, the Ma- </p><p>lay. He seemed to know what he was </p><p>doing. He got into his little boat, and </p><p>pushed off across the glassy sea. </p><p> Bailey helped Suzet te down the cliff-side.</p><p>The girl ran along the wet sand in her thin </p><p>little shoes. She bent over the body of </p><p> Jarrett, who opened his eyes and smiled.</p><p>“Bon Dieu.” exclaimed Suzette, with a </p><p>sigh of relief. </p><p> Jarrett staggered to his feet. He looked</p><p> ghastly in the moonlight with his white face,</p><p> and his hair clotted with blood; yet his</p><p> wound was not so deadly as it appeared to</p><p> Suzette. The knife had struck the bone;</p><p> but it had not penetrated. It was an ugly</p><p> gash, but it would soon heal.</p><p>Big Bailey was examining the body of </p><p>Rod, when Ted Jarrett, leaning on Suzette’s </p><p>arm, managed to stumble across the sands. </p><p> “I sure knocked him out,” he said, bewil-</p><p> dered at the sight, “but don’t say I killed</p><p> him.”</p><p> “He’s dead all right,” replied Bailey,</p><p> “but don’t you worry. We saw the</p><p> finish.”</p><p> Suzette pointed over the sea, where the</p><p> Malay was far out in his little boat.</p><p>“Muda took a hand,” said Bailey, “a </p><p>Malay is a man of one idea, and he has a </p><p>long memory. Muda waited for his </p><p>chance.” </p><p>Jarrett picked up the pearl. It was a </p><p>beauty as it gleamed in the moonlight. </p><p> “How lovely!” exclaimed Suzette.</p><p> “It is for you,” said Jarrett.</p><p> “Non, non, m’sieu. ”</p><p> “Mais oui.” Jarrett persisted; but his</p><p> small stock of inferior French soon gave out,</p><p> so he whispered something in her ear, in his</p><p> own language.</p><p> Big Bailey, a diplomat in his way, had</p><p> turned his back on the pair and was looking</p><p> across the sea.</p><p> The girl shook her head.</p><p>“You must keep this pearl of Torres,” </p><p>she said. “You have fought for it, and won </p><p>it.” </p><p> “You are the pearl of Torres,” he said</p><p> softly. “You are the only pearl I want.”</p><p> Suzette blushed.</p><p> “Well,” cried the American'desperately,</p><p> “if you won’t take the pearl, will you take</p><p> me?”</p><p> Suzette did not reply; but the light in her</p><p> eyes told him what he wanted to know.</p><p> Big Bailey half turned ’round, remarking</p><p> casually:</p><p>“He’s making for one of the islands. </p><p>Guess I’ll let him go.” </p><p> The night was calm, the sea a mirror of</p><p> silver. The Malay’s boat was now a speck</p><p> in the distance. Muda had had his</p><p> revenge.</p><p>THE iSKIDI FEED THE </p><p>EVENING STAR </p><p> Pendexter</p><p>Author of “Yancey of the Rangers,’"'Red Toll,” ctc. </p><p>TTLE PAWNEE VILLAGE on - </p><p>the upper reaches of the Ar- </p><p>kansas was preparing to pass </p><p>the pipe from left to right, the </p><p>order observed in a “medicine smoke,” and </p><p>Black Buffalo, as Murty the trader was </p><p>called, a close companion of Chief White </p><p>Hair, knew the tribal rules would not per- </p><p>mit his attendance. So while White Hair </p><p>and the priests and leading men filed into </p><p>the medicine lodge the trader rode down the </p><p>river trail to the sod-house he and Joe Clay </p><p>had used for four years as a tradmg-post. </p><p>Before leaving the village he promised </p><p>White Hair he would return with whisky </p><p>after the medicine had been made. </p><p> In truth, the Pawnees on the Arkansas in</p><p>the Spring of 1832 were in need of strong </p><p>medicine. In the preceding Fall they had </p><p>exterminated a small band of Dakota </p><p>hunting buffalo on the Republican and a </p><p>fear of reprisal had held the village back </p><p>from securing its own supply of meat. It </p><p>was imperative that their maize and beans </p><p>and pumpkins return bumper crops this </p><p>year. </p><p> Claiming all the territory from the Niobra</p><p>on the North to the Arkansas in the south </p><p>it resulted they were almost constantly at </p><p>war with the mighty Siouan tribes above the </p><p>Platte, or with the Osage, Comanche, </p><p>Arapaho or Kiowa on the south and west. </p><p>One, or several of these tribes, was repeated- </p><p>ly assailing them. They returned blow for </p><p>blow and held their own till the white man </p><p>opened his long trail through their country </p><p>to the southwest, when, although they did </p><p>not yet realize it, their fate as a warring </p><p>nation was sealed. </p><p> Murty and Clay were types of the fear-</p><p>less men who ventured far beyond the fron- </p><p>tier. They risked their lives just as did </p><p>the half-wild “mountain-men,” as the </p><p>trappers were styled. But while the same </p><p>vital element of dauntless courage held </p><p>trader and trapper to their hazardous call- </p><p>ings, the latter was often sustained by his </p><p>lust for adventure, his love for penetrating </p><p>the unknown; the trader was a sullen rock,</p><p>stubbornly holding his place and risking all </p><p>for dross. The only bond between Murty </p><p>and his partner was their mutual love of </p><p>profits. </p><p> Murty was a huge, swart animal, as cruel</p><p>and primitive as his boon companions, the </p><p>savages. Clay was from New Hampshire </p><p>and would always be an alien to the wild </p><p>environment of the Arkansas. He dared </p><p>all his partner dared without possessing </p><p>the latter’s brutal disregard for danger. </p><p>Murty found Indian life and manners pe- </p><p>culiarly satisfying to his crude tastes. He </p><p>had no visions of returning East and </p><p>sloughing off his wild ways. Clay, frail of </p><p>physique, was upheld by a fixed desire to </p><p>gain wealth for what it would purchase </p><p>hi the land of wooden houses. He dreamed </p><p>much of his amiable native hills. When </p><p>he fraternized with the savages it was </p><p>from motives of policy. He did not like </p><p>them. They tolerated him because of his </p><p>partner. </p><p> The lack of harmony between the two had</p><p>rapidly grown pronounced during the last </p><p>half-year. Clay insisted that by identi- </p><p>fying themselves so closely with White </p><p>Hair’s people they were incurring the hatred </p><p>of the other tribes. More than once he </p><p>E </p><p>93 </p><p>94 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>complained because Murty took some part </p><p>in a daring raid, bedecked and painted like </p><p>a Pawnee, a gay handkerchief concealing </p><p>the only attribute lacking in his appearance </p><p>—the peculiar scalp-lock, standing erect </p><p>like a horn. On such occasions of fault- </p><p>finding Murty advised him to mind his own </p><p>business, and continued spending his time </p><p>at the village. </p><p> For two years Clay had planned to sever</p><p>his connections with Murty and return </p><p>East. A double motive restrained him; </p><p>his greed for one more season’s profits and </p><p>his fear of attempting the long journey </p><p>down the Arkansas alone. Murty, appreci- </p><p>ating his uncanny genius for trade, con- </p><p>tinually painted the horrors sure to over- </p><p>take him did he set out alone. </p><p> “If it wa’n’t f’r me ye wouldn’t last ten</p><p>minutes without a knife through yer ribs,” </p><p>he was wont to sneer when Clay voiced his </p><p>desire to cjuit the soul-blighting vocation. </p><p> Sometimes, when half-drunk, he dropped</p><p>more ominous words and led Clay to infer </p><p>he was not even safe from the Pawnees </p><p>once he broke off with Black Buffalo. The </p><p>day he returned from the village to await </p><p>the end of the medicine smoke he drank </p><p>heavily and brought up the old subject of </p><p>Clay’s withdrawal. He was in an unusually </p><p>nasty mood. Clay suddenly declared he </p><p>would not spend another Winter on the </p><p>river. With a string of oaths Murty </p><p>promptly retorted he would withdraw his </p><p>protection if he “heard any more o’ that.” </p><p> In desperation Clay flared back:</p><p> “You keep piling, it on that if I want to</p><p>live I’ve got to agree to everything you say. </p><p>Be I your slave, or not?” </p><p> Heretofore Murty had taken care not</p><p>to goad his partner too far, but the trade </p><p>whisky had destroyed his sense of pro- </p><p>portion, and he roughly replied: </p><p> “I reckon that’s ’bout th’ size of it. If</p><p>ye’re a free man, strike out f’r th’ settle- </p><p>ments.” </p><p> Clay made no response to this challenge.</p><p>With sickening force the truth came home </p><p>to him. Throughout the day he silently </p><p>sat in the doorway while Murty drank and </p><p>slept. Next morning Murty was early </p><p>astir and galloping up the trail. Clay </p><p>cleared away the tin plates and sat down </p><p>outside the door and smoked and thought. </p><p>He had shied away from the ugly fact; now </p><p>he faced it. He was Murty’s slave. </p><p> Should he start alone down the river a</p><p>host of redskins, probably led by his part- </p><p>ner would soon overtake him. Should he </p><p>by some rare chance win free to the settle- </p><p>ments he must go empty-handed. All the </p><p>furs piled up in the post and cached in a </p><p>small cave across the river would remain </p><p>an undivided spoil for his partner. A </p><p>great misery settled over his soul. He was </p><p>home-sick for the East. </p><p> His yearning to go back home had been</p><p>uncommonly keen that Spring. He had </p><p>visited the village when the first rumble </p><p>of thunder initiated the series of sacred </p><p>ceremonies which the Pawnees would keep </p><p>up till Winter. He did not go again that </p><p>season. For four years he had stuck to </p><p>the post, wearing his soul threadbare. Now </p><p>he was weary of it all, weary unto death. </p><p>On first coming to the country he had been </p><p>mildly interested in the practices and </p><p>beliefs of the Indians. </p><p> White Hair—so called because of a</p><p>streak of grayish-white hair through the </p><p>middle of his scalp-lock—was more astute </p><p>than the average savage, but Clay, ab- </p><p>stemious by nature, quickly sickened of </p><p>his drunken orgies with Murty. He in- </p><p>wardly derided as the priests proclaimed </p><p>the supreme power of Tirawa. His mind, </p><p>though tainted, retained its New England </p><p>poise. It returned to the old order of </p><p>thought more insistently as the years </p><p>passed. Whereas he had laughed at the </p><p>heathenish nonsense, now he hotly </p><p>spurned it. </p><p> When he first discovered his partner’s</p><p>credulity concerning the Pawnee belief </p><p>hi supernatural animals he had felt amused. </p><p>By degrees he came to resent it. </p><p> Murty thought like an Indian. Their</p><p>pagan beliefs found a quick response in </p><p>his crude mind. He combined the credulity</p><p>of the child and the ferocity of the brute. </p><p>His first serious quarrel with Clay resulted </p><p>from the latter’s contemptuous comments </p><p>on a Nahurac lodge—a place where the </p><p>Pawnee believed animals met to hold </p><p>councils: Murty firmly believed White </p><p>Hair’s old father had been placed under </p><p>the protection and tutelage of bears when </p><p>a child, which accounted for certain alleged </p><p>bear traits in his old age. </p><p> Clay ridiculed such notions and absorbed</p><p>nothing from his savage environment except </p><p>a trick of throwing a sprig of cedar on the </p><p>fife when the tempest scoured the valley </p><p>of the Arkansas. There was no doubt in </p><p>The Skidi Feed the Evening Star </p><p>95 </p><p>his mind but that cedar would turn light- </p><p>ning aside. </p><p> tie pocketed his pipe but continued</p><p>scowling at the wooded loneliness of the </p><p>river bank. How he hated it! Not only </p><p>was he Murty’s slave, but also the slave </p><p>of ever}' ash thicket and cotton-wood </p><p>growth; of every Indian whim and super- </p><p>stition. He hated the somber wood, the </p><p>emptiness of the river, the earth lodge </p><p>behind him. He even hated the tiny patch </p><p>of beans and pumpkins he had planted back </p><p>of the post. </p><p> “-him! I’m his nigger sure enough!”</p><p>he finally exploded aloud. “I’ve lost four </p><p>years of life just to live out here and work </p><p>for him. If I make a Break he’ll cut my </p><p>throat in a second. I’ve got to wait here </p><p>till he dies.” </p><p> He fell back from the sinister prompting</p><p>this last thought engendered. Yet the </p><p>idea persisted and fascinated, even while </p><p>frightening him. </p><p> There was no doubt about it; he pos-</p><p>sessed the power to terminate Murty’s evil </p><p>influence. All he needed to do was to place </p><p>a fresh percussion cap on the rifle inside </p><p>the door. There was never a minute when </p><p>they were together that Murty was on his </p><p>guard. And it was such a simple expedient! </p><p>For five minutes the potentials of the homi- </p><p>cide braced him up and gave him an air of </p><p>dignity as he pictured himself the master </p><p>of his own fate. Murty stood between him </p><p>and a return home, but Murty could be </p><p>eliminated at any time. </p><p> An inner voice taunted—</p><p> “But how would you get away after kill-</p><p>ing him?” </p><p> His vision of freedom flew to pieces. To</p><p>kill Murty would bring the whole Pawnee </p><p>nation down on him. And Murty knew </p><p>this, and knew his victim would not dare </p><p>rebel. </p><p> “Wouldn’t do at all!” Clay whispered.</p><p>“My hide wouldn’t be safe a second after</p><p>he’s wiped out.” </p><p> However, the notion of Murty’s taking-</p><p>off had found root in his mind and grew </p><p>sturdily, even if, like a weed, it grew pur- </p><p>poselessly. </p><p> Then there evolved from his fear and</p><p>hate another conviction: some time Murty </p><p>would decide to move on, and when he did </p><p>he would take all the furs. To avoid any </p><p>dispute with his partner he would kill him. </p><p>“Yes, siree! He opines I’m nothing but </p><p>a slave. He’ll use me; then he’ll do for </p><p>me.” </p><p> An hour later his last obsession had so</p><p>depressed him that he decided to break his </p><p>rule and ride to the village and observe what </p><p>Murty was up to. </p><p>NEARLY three hundred years be- </p><p>fore, the Pawnee people lured Coro- </p><p>nado from New Mexico across the </p><p>plains to this same country. Could Clay </p><p>have looked ahead fourteen years, as he rode </p><p>along the wild trail, he would have seen </p><p>General Kearney leading his troops along </p><p>the river path on his way to Santa Fe. </p><p>And Keamey was to find the region as </p><p>unsettled and primitive as had the con- </p><p>quistador. The West stood unchanged for </p><p>centuries, awaiting the white man’s roads </p><p>to shatter the savage fastnesses and pave </p><p>the way for plow and homestead. Clay </p><p>would have scorned such a suggestion. He </p><p>believed the West must continue barbarous </p><p>and repelling for further centuries; vast and </p><p>un tameable. </p><p> He passed well-known bluffs and woods,</p><p>and grassy intervals thickly dotted with </p><p>whitening buffalo skulls, only now he was </p><p>sensing danger where before he had found </p><p>only monotony and heart-sickness. So long </p><p>as he had considered Murty a protection </p><p>against the fickle savages he had spleneti- </p><p>cally condemned the country, but had not </p><p>feared. His new angle of vision unraveled </p><p>all his former assurances of personal safety. </p><p> Some cows and their calves, headed by</p><p>an old bull, crossed his trail to make the </p><p>river. Several white wolves slunk along </p><p>behind them. It was a familiar sight, </p><p>observed hundreds of times before; now </p><p>it took on a new significance and seemed</p><p>to picture his own position. He was as </p><p>helpless as one of the calves did the wolves </p><p>once get it alone. He jumped from con- </p><p>clusion to conclusion till he convinced </p><p>himself Murty had planned his death from </p><p>the beginning of their partnership. </p><p> He recalled the man’s reticence to discuss</p><p>former trading ventures; nor could he </p><p>remember he ever had mentioned a partner. </p><p>And yet, when in a genial mood, Murty </p><p>frequently declared that the ideal com- </p><p>bination was a man like himself to mix </p><p>with the Indians and win their good-will, </p><p>with another, like Joey Clay, to stick at </p><p>the trading-post and keep the accounts. </p><p> “He’ll do for me, sure’s lightning,”</p><p>96 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>muttered Clay. “Yes, siree! And he’s </p><p>done for others before I met him. I was </p><p>a fool not to find out something about him </p><p>before coming out to this Gawd-forsaken </p><p>spot. He’s probably waiting till the moun- </p><p>tain men fetch in their next batch of furs. </p><p>He’ll want me to handle the rush. Then </p><p>something’ll happen to J. Clay. But if </p><p>something should happen to him first. </p><p>-! what’s the use? He knows I’m a </p><p>goner the minute he drops out of the game— </p><p>that is, unless the Pawnees wipe him out </p><p>and I have time and luck enough to git </p><p>away.” </p><p> But the idea of the Pawnees killing their</p><p>good friend, Black Buffalo, was too fan- </p><p>tastical to entertain. Still the notion </p><p>bobbed up at times, if only to tantalize </p><p>his ingenuity by challenging him to imagine </p><p>some combination of circumstances wherein </p><p>such a wholesome solution might be pos- </p><p>sible. The only thing he could think of </p><p>was a fight between Murty and the chief </p><p>while drunk. But they had been drunk </p><p>together many times and had never quar- </p><p>reled. </p><p> White Hair’s people were Skidi Pawnee,</p><p>also known as the Wolf Pawnee, and by </p><p>the French as the Pawnee Loup. They </p><p>held the inside, of the circle against many </p><p>hostile tribes only by great sacrifice of man- </p><p>power and by their ability to keep them- </p><p>selves constantly supplied with fresh horses. </p><p>Thus their means of defense—locomotive </p><p>power—was also a continuing cause for </p><p>new wars; and they stole horses from the </p><p>Black Hills to the great range of the </p><p>Comanche. Now the immigrants were </p><p>passing through their country they became </p><p>especially active in stampeding stocks from </p><p>the trains. </p><p> Clay was shrewd enough to see the</p><p>Pawnees were playing a losing game and </p><p>that his partner had done better had he </p><p>pitched his post among the powerful </p><p>Dakota. This, also, had been a stock </p><p>argument between them when Murty </p><p>stripped to breech-cloth and moccasins, </p><p>painted for war, joined his red friends in </p><p>some raid. Murty’s contention was very</p><p>simple: the Pawnees were great fighters, </p><p>therefore they would hold their own for </p><p>many years. </p><p> “What happens to ’em arter I croak</p><p>ain’t worryin’ me any,” he would conclude </p><p>the debate by saying. </p><p> Just as a more important personage once</p><p>remarked he didn’t care how heavily it </p><p>rained after his day closed. </p><p> Now that Clay viewed the Pawnees as his</p><p>potential murderers he took notice of details </p><p>as he slowly rode into the village. Murty </p><p>was lounging before White Hair’s lodge, </p><p>watching a procession of priests escorting </p><p>a comely woman about the village. Clay </p><p>remained on his horse as the little band </p><p>approached the chief’s lodge. The woman, </p><p>prompted by the priests, asked for gifts. </p><p>White Hair listened to her gravely and </p><p>gave her a small bundle of painted sticks. </p><p>The woman smiled and thanked him and </p><p>was led away. Murty discovered his part- </p><p>ner, and, without a trace of their morning </p><p>quarrel, boisterously called out: </p><p> “Jest in time f’r th’ fun, Joey. Hop</p><p>down.” </p><p> Clay dismounted, thrilled by a wild hope</p><p>that he had misjudged Murty. The man </p><p>was hopelessly coarse and brutal, but so long </p><p>as his soul was leavened by an appreciation </p><p>of the humorous he could not be wholly </p><p>evil. Murty stared after the priests and </p><p>the woman and exploded in a loud </p><p>laugh. </p><p> “What’s the idea, Murt?” genially asked</p><p>Clay, his narrow face twisting into a pro- </p><p>pitiating grin. </p><p> “That fool squaw,” chuckled Murty.</p><p>“She’s Comanche; caught in a raid ’bout </p><p>a month ago. She don’t know th’ medicine </p><p>smoke warned White Hair to sacrifice to </p><p>th’ Mornin’ Star. Mornin’ Star’s a man, </p><p>Joey, so they allers sacrifice a woman to </p><p>him. They don’t do it reg’lar. This is </p><p>th’ furst time since we opened th’ post. </p><p>But I’ve watched ’em do it at other villages </p><p>afore I met ye. A sure medicine to make </p><p>th’ corn grow, ye know.” </p><p> The last was said seriously as befitting</p><p>the expression of a self-evident truth. </p><p> “But she laffed,” exclaimed Clay in-</p><p>credulously. </p><p> “That’s th’ funny part of it. She don’t</p><p>know what’s goin’ to happen. She thinks </p><p>it’s all a game,” replied Murty. “It has </p><p>to be done that way, or th’ medicine </p><p>wouldn’t be no good. They’ve treated her </p><p>better’n her own people did. She likes </p><p>here better’n she did to home. Today </p><p>they dress her up an’ tell her to ask f’r </p><p>presents at each lodge. Every lodge gives </p><p>her some dry wood. She won’t guess </p><p>what’s up till they come to sacrifice her an’ </p><p>bury her in th’ cornfields.” </p><p>The Skidi Feed the Evening Star </p><p>97 </p><p> “Good heavens! They’ll kill her!”</p><p>gasped Clay. </p><p> “None o’ that,” ominously warned Murty</p><p>from the corner of his mouth. “Want to </p><p>make th’ chief here thinkin’ ye’re ag’in his </p><p>medicine? They’ve got to have corn, ain’t </p><p>they?” </p><p> “But burying a dead woman won’t make</p><p>corn grow,” expostulated Clay, his soul </p><p>sick and quivering. </p><p> “Th’ devil it won’t!” growled Murty, his</p><p>brows growing black. “Think all th’ real </p><p>medicine is made east o’ th’ Mississippi? </p><p>This village can’t go north arter buf’ler </p><p>till th’ Dakotas git over that last raid on th’ </p><p>Republican. If they raise a big crop o’ </p><p>corn they can trade it with some o’ th’ other </p><p>tribes f’r meat. This medicine is extry </p><p>sure. I know what I’m talkin’ ’bout.” </p><p>“You can stay and watch the devil’s </p><p>work, but I’m going back to the post,” </p><p>muttered Clay, the sweat now trickling </p><p>down his thin face. And he mounted his </p><p>horse hurriedly, to be off before the terrible </p><p>ceremony began. He paused onlyJLo say— </p><p>“Tell White Hair I’ll give him two kegs </p><p>of whisky for the woman.” </p><p> “An’ git knifed f’r meddlin’ with his</p><p>medicine,” snorted Murty. “Nothin’ but </p><p>a regiment o’ soljers could stop it. I </p><p>sha’n’t be home f’r a few days. Keep a </p><p>close watch f’r Dakota scouts.” </p><p> Clay rode like a mad man till far beyond</p><p>the village. He had heard stories of the </p><p>Skidi sacrifice to the morning and evening </p><p>stars but had accepted them as legends, </p><p>just as he did the stories about the Nahurac </p><p>lodges, and children brought up by bears. </p><p>The village, never a prepossessing spot in </p><p>his estimation, now became a foul murder </p><p>trap. What would they not do with him </p><p>should Murty give the word! </p><p>FIVE days passed before Murty </p><p>returned to the post. Clay greeted </p><p>him warmly but studied him </p><p>stealthily. Murty was unusually bois- </p><p>terous in his bearing, and yet he had not </p><p>been drinking. He was effusively cordial. </p><p>Clay quickly decided this exaggerated</p><p>joviality was a mask. Every now and </p><p>then he betrayed himself by quick, sidelong </p><p>glances. Each man was stalking the other, </p><p>only Murty was clumsy at it. </p><p> Clay shivered as his partner began follow-</p><p>ing him about, always keeping behind him. </p><p>Then, without knowing why he should re- </p><p> shape his suspicions, Clay concluded his</p><p>partner was acting thus in order to cover </p><p>up something. Murty talked garrulously </p><p>about his absence and took pains to dwell </p><p>on the fact he had been at the Pawnee </p><p>village all the time. </p><p> Hoping to induce him to betray himself</p><p>in some way Clay took the water pails </p><p>and went toward the river. Once inside </p><p>the narrow, leafy tunnel he halted and </p><p>watched till Murty furtively appeared in </p><p>the doorway and, after a searching scrutiny </p><p>of the woods, hastened to the ash growth </p><p>back of the post. </p><p> Dropping the pails Clay swiftly circled</p><p>back and came upon his partner so un- </p><p>expectedly that only the latter’s abstraction </p><p>prevented a discover}'. Murty was kneel- </p><p>ing at the foot of a big boulder and fumbling </p><p>with moss and dry grass. Finally he rose, </p><p>his fierce eyes ranging the surrounding </p><p>cover suspiciously for a moment. Then </p><p>he ran swiftly toward the post. Clay </p><p>knew his life hung in the balance should </p><p>Murty continue on to the river and find </p><p>the abandoned pails, but there was no </p><p>resisting the shivery curiosity alternately </p><p>freezing and burning his blood. He crawled </p><p>to the rock and thrust his arm and hand </p><p>into a deep cleft. </p><p> He pulled forth a cross made of gold</p><p>beads, several finger-rings of gold and a </p><p>handful of gold coins. There were more </p><p>coins in the hole, a small mound of them. </p><p>Something like a galvanic shock jolted </p><p>him; the treasure trove was crushing him </p><p>with hideous suggestions. </p><p> Restoring the stuff and carefully re-</p><p>placing the moss and grass he scuttled like </p><p>a frightened shadow back to the river </p><p>path. Breathless with fear he came to </p><p>the pails. Was Murty behind him at the </p><p>post, unsuspicious of his spying, or had </p><p>he entered the path and found the pails? </p><p>As Clay sped on down to the river bank</p><p>he had no idea whether he was hastening </p><p>to his death, or was safe for the time being. </p><p> He reached the bank and hurriedly filled</p><p>the pails, expecting every moment to </p><p>behold Murty’s sardonic visage leering </p><p>at him from the undergrowth. Nothing </p><p>happened, and he threw himself on the </p><p>bank and made sure the horse-pistol in </p><p>his belt slipped easily. By degrees his </p><p>heart quieted and his breathing became </p><p>normal. </p><p>“Guess he’s been trading with the Pawnee </p><p>98 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>on the sly for that gold. He’s holding out </p><p>on me.” </p><p> There was a ray of hope in this reasoning,</p><p>for if Murty purposed killing him he would </p><p>scarcely bother to conceal any assets. The </p><p>thought was vastly comforting till he re- </p><p>membered that Murty had withdrawn no </p><p>goods from the post. It was Clay who kept </p><p>the accounts and who was in position to </p><p>abstract goods and trade on his own ac- </p><p>count. Murty had no more finesse in such </p><p>matters than a gorilla. </p><p> “If he got the stuff from the Injuns he</p><p>ain’t paid for it yet,” he concluded. </p><p> “O-e-e! Jo-ey!” loudly called Murty,</p><p>and Clay’s legs twitched convulsively. </p><p> “AH right! Here I be!” Clay bawled</p><p>back, assuming a lazy attitude with his </p><p>right hand resting or, his right hip. </p><p> Murty clumped down the path, whistling</p><p>imitations of bird calls. </p><p> “Ye ain’t been alone ’nough yet but</p><p>what ye want to sneak off an’ leave yer old </p><p>pard,” he chided with what was intended </p><p>for an amiable grin. </p><p> “Been watching something across in the</p><p>bushes,” grunted Clay, pointing his pistol </p><p>toward the opposite shore. “Reckon it’s a </p><p>ant’lope.” </p><p> “Ye’d never land him with that,” said</p><p>Murty. “I don’t see no signs.” </p><p> “Right straight across. Tops of the</p><p>bushes moved. Mebbe it’s gone now,” </p><p>and he rose, still toying with the pistol. </p><p> Murty stooped and picked up the two</p><p>pails, his head passing close to Clay’s face. </p><p>There was red paint back of his ears and </p><p>at the roots of his long black hair. Clay’s </p><p>heart skipped several beats. </p><p> “What did you do after I quit the</p><p>village?” he carelessly inquired. </p><p> Murty darted him a suspicious glance</p><p>and carelessly replied:</p><p> “Jest took it lazy an’ chinned with White</p><p>Ha’r. He wants me to go on a buf’ler hunt. </p><p>Reckons I’d be big medicine ag’in th’ </p><p>Dakota.” </p><p> Clay hesitated, then forced himself to</p><p>ask— </p><p> “The Comanche woman?”</p><p> “Sure. They got to have corn.”</p><p> Clay shuddered and shifted his thoughts</p><p>to the gold cross under the boulder. Murty </p><p>iied when he said he had been at the village. </p><p>The paint and the unusual loot proved he </p><p>had been on a raid. No Indian possessed </p><p>such trinkets unless he had massacred </p><p> whites. An awful loathing of the swart-</p><p>visaged man filled the little New Eng- </p><p>lander’s soul. Something horrible had been </p><p>enacted, and the coins and the cross testified </p><p>to Murty’s complicity. How easy it would </p><p>be to eliminate the man from all further </p><p>consideration by the simple process of </p><p>raising his pistol and pulling the trigger! A </p><p>child could do it. </p><p> “Don’t wave that gun so keerless-like,</p><p>Joey. Ye make me nervous,” remon- </p><p>strated Murty. </p><p> Clay colored and thrust the pistol into</p><p>his belt. Murty was dull of wit but he had </p><p>absorbed enough from the savages to be </p><p>abnormally intuitive. </p><p> To cover his confusion he faced the</p><p>opposite bank and regretted— </p><p> “Wish I had my rifie and a ant’lope</p><p>would pop into sight.” </p><p> He had scarcely spoken when the bushes</p><p>across the river swayed violently; but </p><p>instead of an antelope the figure of a man </p><p>staggered down the bank and raised both </p><p>hands in supplication. </p><p> “-!” yelled Murty, dropping the pails</p><p>and snatching the pistol from his belt. </p><p> “He’s white!” yelled Clay, knocking up</p><p>the weapon as it exploded. “Derned fool! </p><p>Can’t you see it’s a white man, all tuckered</p><p>out?” </p><p> For a moment Murty glared murder at</p><p>his partner, then hoarsely conceded: </p><p>“Derned if it ain’t! Thought it was a </p><p>Dakota scout.” </p><p> Clay passed over the clumsy excuse.</p><p>The tattered figure would not deceive even </p><p>a greenhorn into thinking it an Indian. </p><p>At the sound of the shot the man fell to </p><p>his knees. Clay waved his hand and yelled: </p><p>“Hi! come across. Water’s shallow a few </p><p>rods up-stream. Thought you was a hos- </p><p>tile.” </p><p> The man lurched to his feet and made</p><p>for the ford. Murty watched him with </p><p>wolfish eyes, his Ups drawing back and </p><p>disclosing long teeth, much as a beast </p><p>of prey views the approach of a victim. </p><p>And Clay watched Murty. </p><p> The newcomer was barely able to crawl</p><p>up the bank He was dressed in tatters </p><p>and tags of homespun and had lost his </p><p>boots. A scrubby growth of sandy beard </p><p>accentuated rather than concealed the </p><p>frozen expression of terror on his long </p><p>snuff-colored face. </p><p> “Save me!” he groaned, and Clay caught</p><p>The Skidi Feed the Evening Star </p><p>99 </p><p>his arm and prevented him from falling </p><p>back into the river. </p><p> “Save ye from what? Who be ye?</p><p>Where ye from?” questioned Murty. </p><p> “Wagon train jumped. Dog Crick. All</p><p>kilt,” wailed the stranger. “My name’s </p><p>Bowls.” </p><p> “Seems ye wa’n’t kilt,” growled Murty.</p><p>“When was ye jumped? How’d ye git </p><p>away?” </p><p> “Two nights ago. I was out arter a</p><p>stray hoss. Injuns at work when I come </p><p>back. I kept low in th’ grass. Gawdfrey! </p><p>Such doin’s!” </p><p> “Well, well, you ain’t hurt yet and you’re</p><p>safe now,” soothed Clay, the horripilation </p><p>of his scalp subsiding only when he remem- </p><p>bered his pistol was loaded while Murty’s </p><p>was empty. If the wretched creature </p><p>before him had displayed any fortitude he </p><p>would have believed him sent by Providence </p><p>to be a companion down the Arkansas. </p><p>He had an insane desire to ask if any </p><p>women in the train wore beads in the form </p><p>of a cross. </p><p> “You ain’t hurt and Murty, here, my</p><p>partner, is worth a whole tribe of Injuns.” </p><p>Murty worked his face into a less </p><p>ferocious expression and declared: </p><p> “Bet ye was jumped by Dakota. No</p><p>Southern Injuns up this way, an’ th’ </p><p>Pawnees ain’t stirred from their village f’r </p><p>a long time. Yas, Joey, it’s Dakota work, </p><p>all right. That means I’ve got to hustle </p><p>to White Ha’r’s village an’ warn him th’ </p><p>Dakotas have come. Sit tight at th’ post </p><p>an’ keep yer eye peeled. I’ll be back to- </p><p>night, or tomorrer.” </p><p> “I could hear ’em swearin’ an’ screamin’,</p><p>th’ men’n’ women,” mumbled Bowls as </p><p>Murty disappeared up the path. </p><p> “Many women folks in th’ outfit?” whis-</p><p>pered Clay. </p><p>“Th’ wagon-boss’ woman an’ th’ wives </p><p>o’ five Missouri men. I’m from Ohio.</p><p>Thank th’ Lawd there wa’n’t no children.” </p><p>“Did they take the women prisoners?” </p><p>shivered Clay. </p><p> “Not so bad as that,” returned Bowls,</p><p>pumping up each word with great difficulty. </p><p>A bit of a pause and he ran on. “Th’ </p><p>Injuns passed near me. Me flat in th’grass. </p><p>Some of ’em had ripped burnin’ cloth from </p><p>th’ wagons, an’ they kept wavin’ it as they </p><p>rode. One o’ th’ Injuns talked in English.” </p><p>Clay seized him by the shoulders and </p><p>shook him till his head rocked. </p><p> “Never repeat that. If you want to</p><p>keep on living never, while on the Arkansas, </p><p>let on you was near enough to see the </p><p>Injuns. You heard firing and ran for it. </p><p>And that’s all. Understand?” </p><p> “I reckon,” muttered Bowls. “But one</p><p>of ’em I’d know ag’in if I ever seen him. </p><p>Passed within twelve feet o’ me, wavin’ </p><p>a parcel o’ burnin’ cloth. Had a queer, </p><p>twisted face, and his scalp-lock had a streak </p><p>o’ white paint through it.” </p><p> Clay caught his arm and stole a fright-</p><p>ened glance up the narrow path, and softly </p><p>asked: </p><p> “The Injun who talked English? Would</p><p>you know him again?” </p><p> “No; I couldn't tell him ag’in. Face</p><p>jest plastered over with red paint and </p><p>he wore a hanker ’round his head. He </p><p>rode side o’ th’ Injun with th’ streaked </p><p>hair.” </p><p> Clay drew a deep breath and warned:</p><p>“Listen; I’m your friend. Don’t never </p><p>speak of it to my partner. He gits excited </p><p>easy. Remember.” </p><p> With that he took the pails and refilled</p><p>them and led the way to the post. Murty </p><p>had gone. Without a word Clay took </p><p>down a rifle and loaded it and put on a </p><p>percussion cap and thrust it into Bowls’ </p><p>hands. Next he thrust a pistol and knife </p><p>into the rope that served the immigrant </p><p>for a belt. Then he looked after his own </p><p>rifle and added a knife and second pistol </p><p>to his own belt. </p><p> “Now we’re ready to eat a snack. You</p><p>look kind of peaked,” he said.</p><p>p||E]THE religious ceremonies of the </p><p>nT^rr Pawnees reflected their veneration </p><p>ESS-jof cosmic forces and their worship of </p><p>the heavenly bodies. Tirawa, “father,” </p><p>held all power and executed his will through </p><p>the phenomena of lightning and thunder, </p><p>wind and rain. The universe was dual, </p><p>masculine and feminine. </p><p> Now the priests were declaring the stars</p><p>continued maleficent despite the recent </p><p>sacrifice of the Comanche woman. White </p><p>Hair heard them with surprise, for was not </p><p>the village much richer from the raid on </p><p>the immigrant train? </p><p> “The Dakotas are coming,” explained</p><p>the priest. </p><p> “O-pit-i-kut has had a woman sacrificed,”</p><p>protested White Hair. </p><p> “The Morning Star is satisfied, but the</p><p>100 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Evening Star has had no sacrifice,” replied </p><p>the priest. </p><p> “A man shall be sacrificed to her,” said</p><p>White Hair. </p><p> “Red flesh will not please. The flesh</p><p>must be white,” warned the priest. </p><p> “White Hair will bring white flesh,” was</p><p>the laconic assurance. </p><p> The chief spoke confidently, yet he was</p><p>worried. The Dakotas traveled fast. His </p><p>young men had been reporting their progress </p><p>ever since sunrise. The sacrifice must be </p><p>made at once if the impending evil was to </p><p>be avoided. He lamented his negligence </p><p>in not taking some of the immigrants alive. </p><p>He had wished to do so, but his friend </p><p>insisted there should be no prisoners. And </p><p>it might be several moons before another </p><p>train could be surprised and captured. </p><p> The priest guessed his perturbation, and</p><p>reminded— </p><p> “There is white flesh near; the little</p><p>trader who lives with the Black Buffalo.” </p><p>“I will tell Black Buffalo when he comes. </p><p>He grows tired of the little trader.” </p><p> “Our medicine says we must sacrifice</p><p>before the sun sleeps a second time,” </p><p>warned the priest. “Send after the little </p><p>trader.” </p><p> White Hair sprang to a horse, saving:</p><p>“The victim must not know he is to be </p><p>sacrificed till brought to the painted cross. </p><p>I will go to the Black Buffalo and bring him </p><p>and the little trader back with me. I will </p><p>ride outside of the trail and meet any </p><p>of our scouts who have seen the Dakotas </p><p>since the first runners came in.” </p><p> Because of his slight detour toward the</p><p>open prairie White Hair missed meeting </p><p>Murty on the river trail, and arrived at </p><p>the trading-post shortly after his friend </p><p>set out for the village. Bowls was first </p><p>to see the Indian approaching, and with a </p><p>squeal of terror crawled behind some </p><p>buffalo- robes. Clay advanced to the door </p><p>to greet the chief.</p><p> Leaping from his horse White Hair</p><p>strode to the door and pushing Clay aside </p><p>entered, expecting to find Murty at the </p><p>bottle or asleep. </p><p> “Where is the Black Buffalo?” he de-</p><p>manded, his sharp gaze noting the two </p><p>rifles and the weapons in Clay’s belt. </p><p> “On his way to Little Pawnee Village,”</p><p>growled Clay, his pale eyes lighting venom- </p><p>ously at the overbearing demeanor of the </p><p>chief. </p><p> White Hair reached behind the short</p><p>counter and found Murty’s bottle and </p><p>drained it. Clay was consumed with rage. </p><p>This liberty violated all ethics of trade. </p><p> “Waugh!” grunted White Hair, smacking</p><p>his lips. “Black Buffalo’s friend will go </p><p>to the village now. Black Buffalo wants </p><p>him.” </p><p> “You scum! You just showed you don’t</p><p>know where Black Buffalo is!” cried Clay </p><p>in English. Then in- the chief’s tongue: </p><p>“If Black Buffalo wants me he will come </p><p>for me, or send a talking paper.” </p><p> The rank liquor registered quickly on</p><p>the Indian, and maniacal lights shone in </p><p>his black eyes. A white man must be </p><p>sacrificed to the Evening Star. The Eve- </p><p>ning Star was jealous, and the Dakota </p><p>were advancing. Were there no other </p><p>white man available the chief would have </p><p>sentenced Black Buffalo himself. </p><p> “Come!” he ordered, and his crest of</p><p>black and gray hair seemed to bristle. </p><p>“The medicine pipe has passed from left </p><p>to right. Black Buffalo says for you to </p><p>come.” </p><p> “You have not seen Black Buffalo. I</p><p>stay here,” boldly replied Clay. </p><p> With a guttural growl of rage White</p><p>Hair seized him about the waist and was </p><p>carrying him to the door when a terrified </p><p>sallow visage emerged from behind the </p><p>robes, and a scrawny arm, shaking spas- </p><p>modically, sought to aim a long-barreled </p><p>pistol. Clay, held helpless and glaring </p><p>over the chief’s shoulder, yelled: </p><p> “Git it closer! Git nearer!”</p><p> With a puppy whine of fear Bowls</p><p>crawled to his feet. White Hair caught </p><p>the alarm and, dropping his captive, spun </p><p>about. </p><p> “Th’ Injun I seen!” shrieked Bowls, and</p><p>he closed his eyes and fired just as the chief </p><p>leaped upon him. </p><p> Both crashed to the earthen floor. Clay</p><p>pulled his rescuer from the savage and </p><p>stood him on his feet. Bowls still retained </p><p>the smoking pistol and stared from it to </p><p>the silent figure sprawled out at his feet. </p><p> “You done for him!” panted Clay, hardly</p><p>able to comprehend the miracle. </p><p> Bowls dropped the weapon and whim-</p><p>pered: </p><p> “Th’ Injun with th’ painted hair. Is he</p><p>dead?” </p><p> Clay by this time began to realize their</p><p>predicament. With a snarl of fear he </p><p>The Skidi Feed the Evening Star </p><p>101 </p><p>jumped to the door and glared up and down </p><p>the trail. There was no one in sight. </p><p>Turning to the stupefied immigrant he </p><p>commanded: </p><p> “Help me git him outer here. Oh, Lawd!</p><p>What won’t they do to us if they find </p><p>him!” </p><p> “I knew him when I seen his hair,”</p><p>shivered Bowls. “Reckon I killed him.” </p><p> “Catch hold of his heels, you fool! He</p><p>can’t hurt you.” </p><p> It seemed as if they never would cross</p><p>the narrow opening and gain the shelter </p><p>of the woods. Only by fearful imprecations </p><p>could Clay hold Bowls to the grim task </p><p>till they reached the river bank. Directing </p><p>him to procure some stones for weights </p><p>Clay crouched beside the’ dead chief and </p><p>tried to think. As his mind cleared he </p><p>could foresee the wild excitement and mad </p><p>search for the chief. Four years on the </p><p>Arkansas had taught the trader many </p><p>things; he knew the Pawnees would quickly </p><p>trace their leader to the post and at once </p><p>read the signs on the floor and along the </p><p>river path. </p><p> “They must have known he was coming</p><p>here,” he muttered, essaying to make a </p><p>summary of all the evidence. “He come </p><p>to see Murty, so he must’a’passed him on </p><p>the way. The village don’t know but what </p><p>they met. Murty wants to be shet of me </p><p>and the chief was going to take me to the </p><p>village. _ Said the pipe had passed from </p><p>left to right. They’ve made new medicine </p><p>and I figgered in it some way. By the </p><p>Lawd Harry! They’ll soon have a white </p><p>scalp for this streaked one! Murty’s or </p><p>mine. But the village don’t know him </p><p>and Murty didn’t meet. If they thought </p><p>the two met-” </p><p> He was still nursing his inspiration when</p><p>Bowls staggered up with an armful of </p><p>rocks. </p><p> “Gimme that rope ’round your waist,”</p><p>Clay ordered. “Then go up the path and </p><p>watch if any one comes to the post. Don’t </p><p>show yourself. My partner’ll be back</p><p>soon. I’ve got a plan, but it depends on </p><p>whether he comes alone or not. If Injuns </p><p>come with him we must both hide. If he </p><p>comes alone I’ll see him. But you stay hid. </p><p>Git!” </p><p> After Bowls departed Clay sat for some</p><p>moments, testing the edge of his knife </p><p>with his thumb and working himself up to </p><p>perform a very disagreeable task. </p><p>MURTY arrived at the village just </p><p>as the priests and leading men </p><p>began another medicine smoke. A </p><p>young buck informed him that White Hair </p><p>had gone to the trading-post. Without </p><p>dismounting the trader galloped down the </p><p>trail. He could not understand why he </p><p>had not met the chief. An animal instinct </p><p>was telling him something was radically </p><p>wrong. It was imperative that he find the </p><p>chief and arrange for a band of his braves </p><p>to swoop down and capture the immigrant </p><p>and Clay. At first he had thought to wait </p><p>and spare Clay till after the Fall season </p><p>closed. But he fancied his partner was </p><p>growing suspicious. A clean sweep was </p><p>best. </p><p> Leaping from his horse he ran to the post,</p><p>calling the chief’s name. Clay met him at </p><p>the door, inquiring— </p><p> “What you yelling about?”</p><p> “White Hair? Where is he?”</p><p> “Come and went. Stirred up about</p><p>something. Drank half a bottle of your </p><p>whisky and then reckoned he’d take a </p><p>package of presents back to his squaw, </p><p>said something about you gitting more'n </p><p>your share." </p><p> Murty flushed beneath his heavy tan and</p><p>barked— </p><p> “The fool’s drunk.”</p><p> “Of course. Turned down most a quart.</p><p>I wouldn’t let him have any presents till </p><p>you said so. Thought first he was going </p><p>to knife me, but he cleared out, a-yelling </p><p>how the devil’d be to pay if his squaw </p><p>didn’t git them presents in a rush. Mebbe </p><p>I oughter give them to him. Most wish </p><p>I had after he quit.” And Clay pointed </p><p>to a package of trade gee-gaws and squaw’s</p><p>finery on the counter. “Fixed them up </p><p>after he went hellytowhooping. According </p><p>to his say the Dakotas will be here soon and </p><p>I guess we’ll need his help, or else take to </p><p>the timber.” </p><p> Murty swore fiercely. He was worried</p><p>about the Dakotas. To run for it meant </p><p>the loss of four years’ profits and the </p><p>forfeit of the Pawnees’ friendship. What </p><p>with the danger of the Dakotas and his own </p><p>private homicide plans he was rather un- </p><p>certain just what to do. </p><p> “I’ve done nothing but miss the fool!”</p><p>he raved. “He’s got to be found at once. </p><p>He’s got to lead his men ag’in th’ Dakotas </p><p>an’ hit ’em hard afore they strike th’ </p><p>Arkansas, or we’ll all be wiped out. You </p><p>102 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>did right, Joey, in not letting him have </p><p>the goods. He mustn’t git the notion he </p><p>can come an’ help himself. But we’ll </p><p>take them up to him. Ye’ll be safer at </p><p>the village till we know how the game is </p><p>goin’ with th’ Dakota. Git yer hoss.” </p><p> “If you think best,” meekly assented</p><p>Clay, passing over the parcel of gifts. </p><p>“But we’ll be leaving Bowls.” </p><p> “Ain’t he ’round here?” cried Murty.</p><p>“He’s too white-livered to go far. No; we </p><p>didn’t oughter leave him behind. Give him </p><p>a hoot.” </p><p> Clay rushed out and yelled the immi-</p><p>grant’s name repeatedly. </p><p> “No use,” he puffed. “Wait for me and</p><p>I’ll ride down the trail a piece. Don’t leave </p><p>me alone.” </p><p> This was a masterstroke. For Murty,</p><p>wild with impatience to find the chief and </p><p>perfect a fighting unit to surprise the </p><p>Dakota, was no longer doubtful as to Clay’s </p><p>eagerness to seek safety at the village. </p><p> “Find th’ pup an’ foller me, Joey,” he</p><p>directed. “I’ll send some o’ th’ young </p><p>bucks down to meet ye. Ye won’t be in </p><p>no danger. But I must put a fightin’ </p><p>heart into White I-Ia’r without a minute </p><p>lost, or our goose is cooked. Swing a leg </p><p>over yer hoss an’ th’ minute ye find him </p><p>come a humpin’.” </p><p> “Why can’t you wait a bit?” Clay began</p><p>to expostulate, but now sure of his man </p><p>Murty swung into the saddle and raced </p><p>away. </p><p>MURTY smiled grimly as he can- </p><p>tered along. The disappearance of </p><p>his partner had been a matter </p><p>rather difficult for him to arrange to his </p><p>satisfaction. It had been less easy than </p><p>the proposed victim had supposed. Ques- </p><p>tions would be asked when he returned to </p><p>the frontier without him. There were </p><p>several old mountain men who were still </p><p>curious to learn just how another partner </p><p>of his up in the Medicine Bow Mountains </p><p>had died. Now, with the killing blamed on</p><p>the hostile Dakota the finale would be as </p><p>simple as it was agreeable. </p><p> “Cussed if it ain’t playin’ right into my</p><p>hands,” he exulted. “No matter whether </p><p>th’ Pawnees win or lose I’ll jump this place </p><p>with what furs I can take, an’ cache th’ </p><p>rest. Then I can look up a new partner </p><p>an’ move down Green River way, where no </p><p>questions will be asked.” </p><p> He entered the village and drew rein</p><p>before White Hair’s lodge. Tossing his </p><p>package of presents to the chief’s young </p><p>squaw, he raised his bull-like voice in a </p><p>demand for the chief to appear. Priests </p><p>and warriors crowded thick about him and </p><p>he was astounded to learn White Hair had </p><p>not returned. </p><p> “He went to Black Buffalo’s lodge.</p><p>Black Buffalo must have seen him there,” </p><p>said a priest. </p><p> “He had been there. He was gone when</p><p>I went back the second time. I missed </p><p>him going and coming,” replied the puzzled </p><p>trader. </p><p> “He went to get the little trader. The</p><p>Evening Star is angry with her children, </p><p>the Skidi.” </p><p> Wild suspicions shot through Murty’s</p><p>mind. Clay had said nothing about any </p><p>invitation from the chief to come to the </p><p>village. </p><p> “Send some of your warriors to bring</p><p>the little trader here. He was to follow </p><p>after me with another white man who </p><p>escaped from the immigrant train. Bring </p><p>them both and let the Evening Star be fed. </p><p>Then find the chief-” </p><p> A staccato shriek at his feet caused him</p><p>to jump and lurch half out the saddle. </p><p>What he saw bereft him of reason for a </p><p>moment, and he could only glare with his </p><p>mouth open and his eyes bulging. The </p><p>squaw had opened the pack and was now </p><p>holding up a gay handkerchief to which was </p><p>pinned a fresh scalp. The streak of gray- </p><p>ish-black identified it beyond all question. </p><p>It was the focal point for every pair of </p><p>savage eyes in the savage circle. </p><p> “Gawdamighty! White Ha’r’s top-knot!</p><p>Clay done f’r him an’ put his ha’r in the </p><p>bundle to do f’r me,” babbled the dazed </p><p>plotter. </p><p> “The Black Buffalo sells us to the</p><p>Dakotas!” shouted the priest. </p><p>“SOMETHIN’ cornin’. Ain’t In- </p><p>juns,” barked the night guard of </p><p>the trappers’ camp on the Smoky. </p><p> They were employees of the American</p><p>Fur Company and were making for St. </p><p>Louis, the rival of Montreal as an outfitting </p><p>center. </p><p> “White man’s voice,” decided one of the</p><p>trappers, as the faint cry was repeated. </p><p> “Mebbe a game to git us off our guard,”</p><p>grunted another as he rolled aside and </p><p>The Roughneck </p><p>103 </p><p>nursed his rifle. “Injuns thicker’n wild </p><p>mustard.” </p><p> They listened a moment, then the cry</p><p>came again from the darkness, sounding </p><p>near at hand, but very weak. </p><p> “Help—friends.”</p><p> “Yeh. Friends to honest men. Come</p><p>into th’ light,” ordered the guard, dropping </p><p>on one knee. </p><p> Two men stumbled into the firelight,</p><p>and one glance at their despairing, haggard </p><p>faces told the mountain men they were no </p><p>renegade whites acting as decoys. They </p><p>were made comfortable by the fire and </p><p>provided with food. They ate ravenously, </p><p>Bowls falling asleep with a buffalo rib half </p><p>raised to his mouth. </p><p> Clay produced a pipe and after tobacco</p><p>had been given him he wearily explained: </p><p> “Me’n’ that feller have been running</p><p>from Injuns more’n a month. Lost track </p><p>of time. He swears it’s two months, but </p><p>he’s been loony at times. We was following </p><p>the Arkansas and was chased away from </p><p>it by some Pawnees. We got clear of them, </p><p>but didn’t dare beat back to the river. </p><p>Then our powder give out. Then our </p><p>hosses stampeded one night. We threw </p><p>away our rifles and went it afoot. We </p><p>didn’t dare travel much in the daytime </p><p>during the last two weeks as the country </p><p>seemed full of Injuns making for the </p><p>Arkansas. Guess if we hadn’t hit your </p><p>camp we’d’a’ cashed in. Dead tired. Talk </p><p>more tomorrer.” </p><p> “Th’ Injuns ye see was Dakota tryin’</p><p>to round up Little Pawnee Village,” in- </p><p>formed the guard. “They tried it four </p><p>weeks ago an’ got a awful drubbin’. Seems </p><p>ol’ White Ha’r’s people fed a white man </p><p>to one o’ their star gods th’ night afore th’ </p><p>battle, an’ their medicine was so strong </p><p>they licked ’bout five times their number. </p><p>What Dakotas escaped hustled back home, </p><p>an’ now they’ve come back with some eight </p><p>hundred. Yeh; Arkansas is a good river </p><p>to keep shet of till th’ trouble’s over</p><p>atween th’ two tribes.” </p><p> The firelight struck sparks from Clay’s</p><p>pale eyes. Half-rising from the buffalo </p><p>robe he faintly murmured: </p><p> “White man, eh? Happen to hear his</p><p>name?” </p><p> “Yeh; an’ it didn’t bring any sorrer,”</p><p>growled the trapper. “Skunk had a post </p><p>down th’ river. Kilt his partner an’ mur- </p><p>dered ol’ White Ha’r, th’ Pawnee chief. </p><p>Name was Murty. One of our men hap- </p><p>pened along th’ day follerin’ th’ fight an’ </p><p>l'arned all ’bout it. Better go to sleep.” </p><p>“Yes; I can sleep fine now,” mumbled </p><p>Clay. </p><p>THE ROUGHNECH </p><p> by BERTON BRALEV</p><p> \/f AIDEN aunts, both male and female, like him not;</p><p> He offends their sensibilities too much,</p><p> And he’s always sure to get himself in Dutch</p><p> With the genteel, ultra-cultured, bloodless lot.</p><p> He is always knocking platitudes to pot,</p><p> While he crushes old traditions in his clutch;</p><p> He’s a sort of bomb exploding at a touch,</p><p> Or volcano, spouting lava, fierce and hot.</p><p> He is shaggy, craggy, heavy-shouldered, crude;</p><p> He is oftentimes unconscionably wrong,</p><p> But—he fights the unctuous, pussy-footed brood</p><p> And his voice is that of progress, youthful, strong.</p><p> You may scom him, flay him, hound him and suppress him</p><p> But he’ll go his way in spite of you, God bless him!</p><p>ON SHORT ALLOWANCE </p><p>Jby E.iS.Plfe.dwell </p><p> Author of “No Brains."</p><p> THE job was thrown at big Cap-</p><p>tain John Riley in the first </p><p>place—tossed like a bone to a </p><p>— ■ — dog by a fat-jowled, pig-eyed </p><p>shipowner with the manners of a wart- </p><p>hog and the soul of a shark, who prided </p><p>himself on being direct and businesslike. </p><p> “You piled up a good tramp steamer</p><p>and you’ve been stranded ever since,” </p><p>pointed Peter F. Slemm, the shipowner. </p><p>“You’re in bad with the underwriters. </p><p>You’ll take any job you can get. That’s </p><p>why I hired you and paid you beforehand. </p><p>You’ll work cheap.” </p><p> Humiliated to his toes but desperate</p><p>for work, the other bowed his elderly head </p><p>and spoke in soft, measured words that </p><p>trembled queerly. </p><p> “That is thrue,” he admitted, with the</p><p>suspicion of a brogue. “I’ve a sick wife.” </p><p>“Correct,” agreed Slemm, rolling a </p><p>luscious cigar between thick lips. “Now, </p><p>then. You’ll get a cheap crew and cheap </p><p>grub, and just enough to get to Vladivostok </p><p>at that. The ship ain’t much—she’s forty </p><p>years old, dug out of the boneyard and </p><p>fixed up as a three-masted schooner—but </p><p>she came cheap. That’s the main thing. </p><p> “This is a business venture, you see;</p><p>strictly business,” Slemm condescended to </p><p>explain further. “If you get across I’ll </p><p>make something and maybe you’ll get </p><p>another chance. If she blows up on the </p><p>way—I’m speakin’ frank—it’ll cost as little </p><p>as possible. The cargo of explosives is </p><p>consigned to the Export Transportation </p><p>Department of the Roosian Government. </p><p>I’ll fix the business end. You’ll only have </p><p>to work the ship. That’s fall, I guess.” </p><p> “All right,” murmured Riley, huskily,</p><p>as his big fists clenched, “I’ll take the </p><p>chance.” </p><p> Slemm did not offer to shake hands and</p><p>Riley was glad of it, for the trim, gray-eyed, </p><p>mustached mariner with the ramrod spine </p><p>longed to choke the cold-eyed owner and</p><p>scatter his fat carcass about the room. </p><p>Only the subsequent unemployment de- </p><p>terred hun—and he had tramped the streets </p><p>till his heart was sick within him. </p><p> “Oh, a jewel of an owner!” Riley mut-</p><p>tered bitterly as he strode toward the San </p><p>Francisco waterfront. “A grand, fine </p><p>shpecimen of a cold-blooded swine! And </p><p>me once captain of a ten-thousand-ton </p><p>freighter! Oh, well—mebbe I’ll meet </p><p>friends on the east coast. It’s a gambler’s </p><p>chance, but I’m a gambler. I have to be!” </p><p> Had the sailor known how an ironic</p><p>fate was shuffling cards against him he </p><p>might not have gambled at all, desperate </p><p>as he was; but like other humans he could </p><p>not peer into the future. Thus he found </p><p>himself a week later on the poop of a big </p><p>three-masted “fore and after” as she </p><p>pointed toward the horizon of the Pacific </p><p>and rolled her soggy old nose into the while- </p><p>capped seas, leaving the sentinel Golden </p><p>Gate behind her. </p><p> The ship gave Riley’s sailor-heart a</p><p>twinge when first he set foot on her, for </p><p>cheap she was. The hull was the worst </p><p>of the old hulks resurrected from Oakland </p><p>estuary, the graveyard of the Pacific. </p><p>The canvas, rigging and sticks were patch- </p><p>work, collected from everywhere. The </p><p>104 </p><p>On Short Allowance </p><p>105 </p><p>interior furnishings were meager and old. </p><p>There were no topsails. Topsails cost </p><p>money. Only the cargo was valuable and </p><p>that consisted of dynamite and gun- </p><p>powder, packed in waterproof cases and </p><p>kegs in the hold till the old ship staggered </p><p>under its lethal load. </p><p> Somehow Riley collected a crew. Good</p><p>men were afloat in better ships and to get </p><p>a total of ten souls aboard the desperate </p><p>master had to take anything that walked, </p><p>trusting to make the riffraff into sailors </p><p>later. His last recruit was his prize. It </p><p>came on a wharf where he was cursing his </p><p>schooner and whined for a job at sea. </p><p> “Gimme a chance,” pleaded the cringing</p><p>derelict. “Jest a show to git away from </p><p>waterfront booze. I won’t be in the way— </p><p>Gimme a chancel” </p><p> Clad in a sweaty gingham shirt and faded</p><p>blue overalls, the man was short, stocky, </p><p>snub-nosed, blear-eyed and red-faced, a </p><p>veteran alcoholic showing long allegiance </p><p>to John Barleycorn. He looked too worth- </p><p>less even for that ship, but he persisted. </p><p> Waldng to semi-consciousness in a quiet</p><p>gutter an hour before he had reviewed his </p><p>past life hazily, felt deeply and senti- </p><p>mentally regretful, and resolved on a last </p><p>effort to put himself out of temptation. </p><p>Thus he sought the sea, where liquor is not </p><p>supposed to be. </p><p> When dynamite was mentioned the man</p><p>ignored it—or never heard it—and still </p><p>persisted. The framework of his body </p><p>seemed fairly sound and his eyes held a </p><p>blurred sort of intelligence, so Riley signed </p><p>him on and hoped for the best. The man </p><p>called himself “Whisky” Bill, and was </p><p>shunted into the forecastle, into the com- </p><p>pany of men scarce better than he. </p><p> Before this Riley had signed on a tall,</p><p>dark-haired, silent nondescript with the </p><p>sky-blue eyes found in visionaries, con- </p><p>querors and fanatics, and a part of a little </p><p>finger gone. He acquired the name of </p><p>“Big Frank.” The man’s face and bearing </p><p>seemed dull and listless, even mournful; </p><p>but Riley began to note otherwise on the</p><p>second day out, when it was brought home </p><p>to him forcibly. </p><p> “The crew kicks about the grub already,”</p><p>warned First Mate Blazon, a swarthy, lazy </p><p>product of the Florida Keys. “Watch that </p><p>Big Frank. He leads them.” </p><p> “On the shtart of the voyage, eh? Then</p><p>we’ll have to shtop it,” said Riley, quietly. </p><p>“I’ll admit the grub’s dog-rotten but I’ll </p><p>shtand no slack from that crowd. I don’t </p><p>dare. They don’t know their work. Ye </p><p>gods, what a crew!” And the master shook </p><p>anguished fists in the air. </p><p> Later, in his bare cabin, Riley thought</p><p>things over. He pitied these men and had </p><p>planned to be an easy master. He was </p><p>born to be friends with humankind, but </p><p>now he resolved to exact the strictest kind </p><p>of discipline. The food was enough to make </p><p>any crew restive. There must be no slack </p><p>master on top of that. </p><p> Furthermore, the ship might be filthy</p><p>but Riley w'ould not be. He understood </p><p>the influence of a spruce, clean-looking </p><p>officer, so the vessel saw him thereafter </p><p>in his old natty master’s uniform with only </p><p>the insignia of his former line taken off. </p><p>On that slattern schooner the trim mer- </p><p>chant-marine skipper seemed incongruous, </p><p>but he had himself to please. </p><p> Riley had no doubts about the loyalty</p><p>of the easy-going Blazon or his second-mate, </p><p>a Swede named Larsen, but he saw they </p><p>had to toe the mark also, otherwise the </p><p>master would have to impose his discipline </p><p>single-handed, fie resolved to give them </p><p>an object lesson at the first opportunity, </p><p>and thus on the fifth day, when a scowling </p><p>Greek at the mainmast obeyed the first </p><p>mate’s orders sluggishly, Riley was pre- </p><p>pared. He leaped off the poop and grabbed </p><p>the man by the back of the neck while </p><p>noting that two other members of the crew </p><p>were watching. </p><p> “What d'ye mean by that?” he bawled.</p><p>“When you get an ordher you’ll jumpl” </p><p>And he shook the other till his teeth </p><p>chattered. “Now,” continued the wrath- </p><p>ful master, “you’ll have a little dhrill.</p><p>You see that cordage coiled along the deck? </p><p>You’ll coil and uncoil it for one hour. If </p><p>you loaf one minute you’ll get two hours </p><p>more. Now shtart!” </p><p> From the corner of his eye Riley noted</p><p>a giant form loafing almost behind turn and </p><p>whirled about suddenly. It was Big Frank. </p><p> “Well?” snapped the master, stiffening.</p><p> The other looked embarrassed and Riley</p><p>pointed toward the forecastle. </p><p> “Go forward, you!” he roared.</p><p> The other hesitated a fraction of a</p><p>second but at the first twitch of the peppery </p><p>master’s muscles he shuffled toward the </p><p>forecastle and Riley mounted the poop </p><p>again. The mate had quietly taken in the </p><p>io6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>scene and smiled at him, but Riley was not </p><p>in that mood. </p><p> “Mishter Blazong,” said the master,</p><p>pointedly, “the next time you’re not </p><p>obeyed inshtantly, take action!” </p><p> “I was goin’ to start,” protested the</p><p>mate, “but you went too fast.” </p><p> “Don’t let any one beat you!” snapped</p><p>Riley. “We’ve got to choke off throuble </p><p>before it shtarts, with this crowd. If there </p><p>was a man among ’em I’d praise the saints, </p><p>but they’re too cheap! That Big Frank is </p><p>the only one with muscles and if he shtarts </p><p>anything, get him quick. Them’s ordhers!” </p><p>Without further words Riley went to his </p><p>dingy cabin, thinking of the sordid owner </p><p>who sent this foul old hulk to sea without </p><p>pity for those aboard and wishing he had </p><p>choked the fat scoundrel when he had the </p><p>chance. Sitting down to his tasteless meal </p><p>of suspicious canned beef and ancient </p><p>potatoes and brackish bread, Riley longed </p><p>for the choking still more. Back in his </p><p>consciousness he wondered what he would </p><p>do after he turned liis cargo over to the </p><p>Russians. Another trip on a Slemm ship </p><p>was unthinkable. </p><p>BUT the next four weeks went by </p><p>quietly, with the crew sullen but </p><p>outwardly falling in with Riley’s </p><p>taut discipline and the old dynamite- </p><p>schooner slatting and groaning westward </p><p>and northward across the seas, rolling the </p><p>miles behind her. Then came a storm. </p><p>Mistrusting his ship, Riley stood by his </p><p>helmsman and was drenched and battered </p><p>for hours by whipping spindrift while </p><p>snarling seas leaped over the low bulwarks </p><p>and swept the deck a hundred times. When </p><p>the storm subsided forty hours after it </p><p>started and the wind swung from the </p><p>north in a steady blow, the tired master </p><p>turned into his bunk and let the big, </p><p>regular waves rock him .to sleep. </p><p> Riley awoke suddenly in his dark bunk.</p><p>A yell and the sounds of rushing feet on </p><p>the deck apprized him that something was </p><p>amiss. Jumping out of his bunk and </p><p>donning trousers, Riley sensed it was </p><p>early morning—before dawn.</p><p> The agitated clatter of feet outside</p><p>increased. Voices shouted frantically. On </p><p>the poop above Riley something heavy was </p><p>being hauled along the deck to port. It </p><p>sounded like a boat being swung from her </p><p>davits. A sharp voice boomed from above, </p><p>then footsteps thundered down the cabin </p><p>companionway while the half-clad Riley </p><p>grabbed a pistol from a holster and waited </p><p>till a near-by voice howled to him. </p><p> “Jump for your life!” shrieked the voice.</p><p>It belonged to Blazon, the mate. “The </p><p>ship is afire forward!” </p><p> The man’s sea-boots clattered upward</p><p>again desperately. </p><p> Riley’s heart clutched and his hair</p><p>tingled at the instant of imagination that </p><p>pictured what would happen when the first </p><p>spark struck that cargo. Panic seized him, </p><p>but only for a moment. The next instant </p><p>he rushed to the deck, pistol in hand. </p><p> Forward, a tiny glare showed through</p><p>the glass of the closed hatch above the </p><p>forecastle—a sinister flicker of light just </p><p>bright enough to throw the panting, </p><p>shrieking men into shadow as they surged </p><p>about the poop and labored madly to cast </p><p>overside the bulky small boat. The mate </p><p>was directing savagely with fists and curses. </p><p>The quivering second mate was working </p><p>at the stubborn falls. The prow of the </p><p>small boat was swung outward, almost </p><p>meeting the heavy seas that leaped toward </p><p>the deck, and near that prow spoke a </p><p>whimpering voice, chattering with terror </p><p>and repealing its phrase automatically— </p><p> “He turned the lamp over—he turned the</p><p>lamp over!” </p><p> Riley’s eye took in the scene in an instant.</p><p>He glanced toward the wheel, where the </p><p>helmsman had left to join in the general </p><p>panic. Then Riley glanced forward. The </p><p>yellow-red light seemed a little larger. </p><p>And dynamite only a few inches away! </p><p> The cool dawn-wind was soughing through</p><p>the rigging, laying the ship far over to </p><p>port and whistling about the hatch above </p><p>the forecastle where only a flimsy floor </p><p>stood between the flames and the cargo.</p><p>Above, the stars were beginning to pale. </p><p>Far to the north but within easy small- </p><p>boat distance stretched the many islands </p><p>of the Aleutian group, like stepping-stones </p><p>from Alaska to the Orient. Alongside the </p><p>old schooner the sea was running high and </p><p>the vessel was quartering the giant waves </p><p>and just beginning to broach as it felt the </p><p>lack of the helmsman’s hands. </p><p> In the flash that the practised eye of</p><p>Riley noted all these things his mind was </p><p>made up. He raised the pistol and strode </p><p>toward the mob, firing into the air. The </p><p>report half-paralyzed some of them. </p><p>On Short Allowance </p><p>107 </p><p> “Off from that boat!” roared Riley.</p><p>“Get away!” </p><p> For an instant the men hesitated and the</p><p>master leveled the pistol toward the mass. </p><p> “Go forward, somebody!” he roared.</p><p>“Get forward and open that hatch—quick!” </p><p>The man near the small boat’s prow </p><p>backed away from it and seemed undecided; </p><p>but another man claimed the master’s </p><p>attention. </p><p> “No!” shrieked Larsen, the cowering</p><p>second mate. “Are you mad? It iss </p><p>murder! No!” </p><p> In the faint glow of the dawn the man’s</p><p>face was grimacing and his voice whinnied </p><p>with fear; but Riley could not hesitate. </p><p>He knew that each second a spark was </p><p>nearing the slumbering inferno in the </p><p>hold. </p><p> “Go forward!” he thundered, and a gust</p><p>of wind took the full force of his voice into </p><p>the crowd. “Go forward, some of you, </p><p>quick—before I kill you all!” </p><p> Instantly Larsen jumped backward and</p><p>overboard. Equally quick, the desperate </p><p>master fired, but the bullet missed its mark. </p><p>Then Big Frank started frantically to ward </p><p>off the master, but Riley ignored him. </p><p>Something else had happened. </p><p> In that maddening second a chunky</p><p>figure had rushed away from the small </p><p>boat’s prow and off the poop, while Riley </p><p>sprang to the wheel. The figure dashed </p><p>wildly across the deck. One leap and the </p><p>man was up the forward steps. Another </p><p>brought him to the forecastle hatch. A </p><p>quick tug and it came off, and the heavy </p><p>north wind sucked down the open hole and </p><p>blew tiny sparks and wisps of smoke upward </p><p>and outward. </p><p> “Good work, Whisky Bill—climb the</p><p>rigging!” shrieked Riley, as he twisted the </p><p>spokes of the wheel like a madman, and the </p><p>other understood somehow and went up </p><p>the shrouds like a panic-stricken monkey, </p><p>while Riley swung the heavy ship around. </p><p> Ignoring the maniacs by the small boat,</p><p>with his heart in his mouth, wondering </p><p>if his next moment would be in eternity, </p><p>Riley pointed his ship straight into the wind. </p><p>With the lift of a giant wave the bow arose </p><p>till the deck tilted high and the old schooner </p><p>groaned with the extra strain. Then the </p><p>big wave swirled under the stern and the </p><p>bow lowered till Riley felt as if on top of a </p><p>steep hill. The next comber loomed in </p><p>front of him like a dark, high wall. </p><p> “Hold on every one!” roared the master.</p><p>“Hold, for your lives!” </p><p> The bowsprit dived straight into the</p><p>foaming, seething wall of water that </p><p>crashed onward till it struck the edge of </p><p>the hatchway. Then vats and firkins and </p><p>tons of brine swept into the hold and the </p><p>lethal light snuffed out. </p><p> The big wave swirled aft in foaming</p><p>frenzy. It slapped the mainmast with </p><p>mighty force. It struck the break of the </p><p>poop and climbed up, up, till the feet and </p><p>knees and thighs of the master were under </p><p>cold water and he held to the wheel fran- </p><p>tically while the slavering mass of brine </p><p>and foam tried to suck him away from it. </p><p>The small boat disappeared unseen. Then </p><p>gradually the heavy mass of water grew </p><p>lower about the skipper’s legs and the </p><p>awful pressure lessened. The ship’s bow </p><p>and stern came up heavily and then the </p><p>old craft groaned and slumped down— </p><p>waterlogged. </p><p> “That,” breathed the half-naked Riley,</p><p>as he began to swing the logy ship to port </p><p>and let the wind again catch the slatting </p><p>sails, “that is the way to put out a fire!” </p><p>FIVE days and nights the pumps </p><p>were working till the porous-hided </p><p>old tub slowly came up out of the </p><p>water. Three men were gone—vanished </p><p>with the small boat or overboard—but </p><p>Riley made up for that by peeling off his </p><p>natty brass-buttoned coat and pi telling </p><p>in himself, setting an example to the hard- </p><p>driven crew. The skipper watched that </p><p>crew closely, ready for the first hostile </p><p>move. But there was none. Perhaps his </p><p>set face forestalled it as he thought over </p><p>his situation, thankful only that the cargo </p><p>was waterproof and hardly damaged. He </p><p>said little but worked and waited until the</p><p>ship was right again. </p><p> On the sixth day all hands rested, and</p><p>on the next, refreshed and invigorated, </p><p>blessed by a fresh wind that shoved the </p><p>old craft joyously along, Riley went on </p><p>deck prepared to thresh out certain ques- </p><p>tions. Relieving the mate he ordered both </p><p>watches on deck and soon they grouped </p><p>under the poop, looking curious or em- </p><p>barrassed, as the case might be. Then, </p><p>with only five of his former crew before </p><p>him and with the mate sleeping below, the </p><p>skipper began his formal court martial. </p><p> “You,” he began, pointing a forefinger</p><p>io8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>at Whisky Bill. “You said ‘he tipped the </p><p>lamp over.’ Who did?” </p><p> Weak and wobbly front his alcohol-cure</p><p>and his recent labor, Bill was taken aback. </p><p>Blank-faced, he tried to think while his </p><p>eyes swung toward the threatening face of </p><p>Big Frank, and then away. Riley noticed </p><p>the glance while Bill sparred for time. </p><p> “Who? Me?” he asked, scratching his</p><p>head. </p><p> “You,” said the master, grimly.</p><p> “Did—did I say that?”</p><p> “You did,” replied Riley, his temper</p><p>rising. “Tell me who tipped that lamp!” </p><p>lie thundered. “Was it this man, Frank? </p><p>quick, now—shpeak up!” </p><p> “M-mebbe,” said Bill, nervously. “I</p><p>dunno. I didn’t see him.” </p><p> “And a foc’sle lamp hangin’ on heavy</p><p>chains was tipped over accidental,” said </p><p>Riley, sarcastically. “Let’s see who filed </p><p>the chains. You, Frank, shtep forward!” </p><p>There was a ring of something dangerous </p><p>in the Irish captain’s voice and the sullen </p><p>sailor felt impelled to step forward while </p><p>Riley half-descended the steps and smiled </p><p>at him peculiarly. </p><p> “And why didn’t ye jump into the</p><p>small boat with the others when the big </p><p>wave hit us?” asked Riley, softly. “The </p><p>boat was provisioned for a long cruise, </p><p>wasn’t it? That was part of the big idea, </p><p>wasn’t it? You’d tip over the lamp and </p><p>then every one would have a fine excuse </p><p>to jump into the shmall boat and ride to the </p><p>Aleutians. Them that wasn’t in on the </p><p>plan would be frightened enough to go </p><p>into the boat anyhow. It was a fine, </p><p>genteel, beautiful idea—but why didn’t ye </p><p>go into the boat? Did ye fear there’d be a </p><p>hitch?” </p><p> The big man’s eyes looked at the deck</p><p>and he said nothing. </p><p> “Well?” snapped Riley. “Shpeak up.</p><p>What about it? The second mate was</p><p>frightened enough to leave. Why didn’t </p><p>you? Are ye too brave? Or—” and his </p><p>voice was smooth as ice and deadly as </p><p>poison—“did ye notice I was watchin’ ye?” </p><p>There was still no answer from Big Frank </p><p>and the rest of the crew watched him, </p><p>some anxiously, some in amazement. The </p><p>amazed ones included only the cook and </p><p>Whisky Bill and Riley’s heart sank at what </p><p>he had to depend on—one lazy mate, one </p><p>fat cook and one half-convalescent drunk- </p><p>ard. But the thought only made the </p><p>master set his jaws harder. Come what </p><p>might, Big Frank had to be punished. </p><p> Jumping from the steps like a cat, Riley</p><p>smashed a fist straight into Big Frank’s </p><p>eye and followed it up with the other fist. </p><p> “You’ll lead the crew to desert, will ye?”</p><p>snarled Riley. “You’ll blow the ship </p><p>because ye don’t like the grub, eh? All </p><p>right, you yellow sneak—try this!” </p><p> The big sailor tried to spar off the blows</p><p>but the master was too eager and the mighty </p><p>fists crashed through his guard. Big Frank </p><p>came to with a man slushing his face with a </p><p>bucket of water and the master standing </p><p>over his prone body. </p><p> “You’re awake, are ye?” bellowed the</p><p>skipper, noting that the rest of the men </p><p>were very quiet. “All right—get up!” </p><p>The wobbly sailor was helped to his feet. </p><p> “Now,” ruled the master, “you’re due for</p><p>chains but I’m short-handed. You’ll help </p><p>work the ship and at night you’ll be locked </p><p>in the afther lazaret. I’ll take some o’ that </p><p>swagger out o’ you or I’ll kill ye! Here- </p><p>afther I’ll go armed. The first wrong move </p><p>you make will be your last. Undershtand? </p><p>Yes. Then go help the cook!” </p><p> Thus passed the first big episode of the</p><p>trip across. Thereafter the ship bowled </p><p>along with Riley watchful, the mate </p><p>cautious, the crew subdued, and Whisky </p><p>Bill beginning to show tan in place of the </p><p>purple-red that once made his face livid. </p><p>Watching the man’s awkward attempts at </p><p>sailor-work despite his awful physical </p><p>reaction and noting that he never com- </p><p>plained, Riley’s heart warmed toward the </p><p>derelict, though he avoided the slightest </p><p>appearance of favoritism and drove the</p><p>man with the rest. Gradually Bill’s stag- </p><p>nant brain cleared, the half-paralyzed </p><p>muscles whipped into shape, and he ate </p><p>better, slept better, kept his sea-legs better. </p><p>Riley was getting proud of his liquor-cure. </p><p> Whisky Bill’s gratitude came on a sultry</p><p>midnight weeks later when the skipper was </p><p>sleeping in his bunk in the cabin. The </p><p>mate’s bunk was opposite his but the mate </p><p>was on duty. There were no partitioned </p><p>rooms for the officers. It saved space for </p><p>more cargo. </p><p> The cabin door opened stealthily and a</p><p>tiny shaft of the lighter gloom outside </p><p>pierced the black darkness within. Not a </p><p>sound was heard yet Riley sensed the thing </p><p>and awoke with a start. Noting the streak </p><p>of light he grasped the handle of a pistol </p><p>On Short Allowance </p><p>109 </p><p>under his pillow and lay ready for action. </p><p> The doorway widened until more than a</p><p>foot of haze showed and a dark object </p><p>crossed the threshold. Then the door </p><p>began closing softly. That was the mo- </p><p>ment Riley was waiting for. Sitting up- </p><p>right, he had that form exactly covered with </p><p>the pistol and his nerves were never icier. </p><p>“HANDS up!” he snarled. “Quick!” </p><p>“All right, sir,” came a soft voice </p><p>in reply. “Wait till I close the door.” </p><p>The voice was Whisky Bill's and Riley </p><p>grunted and pointed the pistol-muzzle </p><p>downward, wondering what would come </p><p>next. The door closed softly and foot- </p><p>steps pattered across the floor to the bunk. </p><p> “Well?” snapped Riley. “What does</p><p>this mean?” </p><p> “I couldn’t come any sooner,” apologized</p><p>Bill. “I’m on duty and the rest is sort o’ </p><p>watchin’ me. You see, they’re goin’ ',d </p><p>blow up the ship.” </p><p> At this calm announcement Riley felt his</p><p>muscles tingle and his scalp itch. </p><p> “Again? How? Who? When?” he</p><p>rasped. </p><p> “In them straits near Japan. I forgot</p><p>the name.” </p><p> “Sangar. The Japs call it Tsugaru,”</p><p>said Riley. “We’ll pass through to make </p><p>the. Japan Sea. That’ll be about two </p><p>weeks from now. How will this blow-up </p><p>business be done?” </p><p> “Like last time. There’ll be a fire an’</p><p>everybody’ll rush fer the boats, only this </p><p>time there ain’t goin’ to be no heavy sea to </p><p>put the fire out. The ship’s goin’ to blow </p><p>fer keeps.” </p><p> “Um. Yes,” said Riley, sarcastically.</p><p>“And what’ll I be doin’ while all this is </p><p>goin’ on—playin’ solitaire?” </p><p> “No. You’ll go natural to the fire and</p><p>see what can be done. That’s what you’d </p><p>do, ain’t it? Well, while you’re lookin’ at</p><p>things the rest’ll skip.” </p><p> Riley was thinking hard.</p><p> “And how do you know all this?” he</p><p>asked. </p><p> “Me? Oh, I’m one of them.”</p><p> The statement was so cool and casual</p><p>that it made Riley’s brain buzz. “One </p><p>of them?” he echoed, wondering whether </p><p>to hug this man or shoot him for safety. </p><p> “Sure, I had to, or else—blooey fer me!</p><p>If I didn’t stand in I’d be suspicioned, so </p><p>I stood in—see? I’m now the worst little </p><p>grouch in the crew exceptin’ Big Frank.” </p><p>“I see,” murmured the skipper, slowly. </p><p>“And is the whole crowd in on the plot?” </p><p>“The whole gang—Big Frank an’ Looie </p><p>the Greek an’ Changes the Sloavk/ an’ me. </p><p>All but the cook. Every one’s sick o’ </p><p>weevil biscuits an’ four-year-old spuds an’ </p><p>condemn’ corn beef an-” </p><p> “Enough!” groaned the skipper, irritably.</p><p>“I’m sick of it too. But why should the </p><p>crew want to jump ship when we’re almost </p><p>across?” </p><p> “Because it’s a grudge now, sir. The</p><p>other time they wanted to git away because </p><p>o’ the grub, but the way you handled ’em </p><p>made ’em sore an’ Big Frank’s been jawin’ </p><p>an’ grouchin’ an’ stewin’ till they’re all </p><p>worked up. And—the grub’s still with </p><p>us.” </p><p> “I see,” murmured the thoughtful master,</p><p>fingering the pistol carefully. “And was </p><p>the second mate—and the two other men </p><p>that left us—in on the first plot?” </p><p>“Naw!” replied Bill. “They was plain </p><p>scared, like they was expected to be.” </p><p>There was a long silence from the skip- </p><p>per’s bunk, for Riley was thinking hard. </p><p>Thrust by fate into this worthless and dan- </p><p>gerous command and in trouble through </p><p>no direct fault of his own, he was appalled </p><p>at the relentlessness of the men he had </p><p>counted in San Francisco to make into </p><p>sailors; and yet through his thoughts ran </p><p>a constant wonder at this half-cured </p><p>derelict, Whisky Bill. The man owed him </p><p>nothing except a job, and that was the</p><p>poorest on the seven seas. </p><p> “Tell me,” said Riley, suddenly. “Why</p><p>did ye come to warn me?” </p><p> There was another long silence before</p><p>the man’s uncertain voice answered: </p><p>“You’re a white guy. The rest of ’em’s </p><p>tramps. You’re the only guy on the ship </p><p>that shaves an’ looks like somethin’ human. </p><p>I'm an American.” </p><p> Although at first the skipper groped,</p><p>he understood upon reflection. It was the </p><p>call of caste and self-respect, to a man </p><p>climbing up. </p><p> “I see,” said Riley, putting bare feet on</p><p>the dark floor, “and I see I can thrust ye. </p><p>But,” and his voice was speculative, “how </p><p>good could ye be in a pinch?” </p><p> “I dunno, sir,” admitted Bill, soberly.</p><p>“Sometimes me heart acts wrong, but </p><p>mebbe I can be some good. I’m Billy </p><p>Kenyon.” </p><p>no </p><p>Adventure </p><p> "And who’se he?”</p><p> “I stood off Joe Gans fer ten rounds</p><p>once,” came the reply, not without pride, </p><p>“an’ then the booze come along. That’s </p><p>all, sir.” </p><p> “I undershtand,” murmured Riley, with</p><p>pity in his voice. “But mebbe it’ll not </p><p>come to a fight. I’ve another plan. You </p><p>say you’re one with the gang forward. Do </p><p>they thrust ye?” </p><p> “Almost. Not quite.”</p><p> “ ’Tis well. Now listen. Barrin’ head</p><p>winds we reach Sangar Shtraits in just </p><p>under two weeks. Pray there’ll be no </p><p>throuble before then or we’ll be up in the </p><p>air in more ways than one. But you’ve </p><p>got near two weeks to prove yourself a </p><p>majestic conshpirator. Undershtand? You’ll </p><p>be one of them—most valiant in cursin’ ship </p><p>an’ skipper. Then when the time draws </p><p>nigh you’ll volunteer to fire the ship while </p><p>the rest of the rats scuttle toward the whale- </p><p>boat on the poop.” </p><p> Riley heard his companion gurgle and</p><p>wriggle but proceeded calmly. </p><p> “You’ll get the job. They’ll be lookin’</p><p>for a sucker an’ mebbe they’ll be glad to be </p><p>rid of ye. Now listen. The fire will begin </p><p>in the foc’sle for that’s the only place to </p><p>give every one time to run for the star’bd </p><p>whaleboat while the flames are eatin’ </p><p>through the forward deck plankin’. If </p><p>the fire was tossed into the cargo hatch- </p><p>way— there’d be no whaleboat. Now, </p><p>when ye get the word you’ll see there’s </p><p>much shmoke and little fire forward, with </p><p>a bucket o’ water to put it out. Then </p><p>your job is done—unless somethin’ goes </p><p>wrong.” </p><p> Bill cogitated over this for some time,</p><p>while from outside came the faint voice of </p><p>the mate shouting an order to his watch. </p><p>Riley was first to note it. </p><p> “Go before you’re missed,” he said.</p><p>“Better not take the door. Go up the </p><p>companionway. Mebbe the helmsman’s </p><p>asleep. And remembher what I told ye.</p><p>I’ll not forget your coming here this night. </p><p>Now go!” </p><p> Obeying noiselessly, Bill groped his way</p><p>upward till the faint sound of a hatch lifting </p><p>and closing apprized the skipper that the </p><p>man had gained the poop. Then Captain </p><p>John Riley, his mind at ease because he </p><p>knew what was ahead and when it would </p><p>come, sank into his bunk and slept the </p><p>sleep of a man without care. </p><p>TWELVE peaceful days followed, </p><p>blessed by gracious winds that </p><p>made the old schooner heel over </p><p>skittishly like a sinful old crone dancing in </p><p>her second childhood. Riley cracked on </p><p>all sail and longed for topsails, but even </p><p>as she was the old tub slapped her blunt </p><p>bows in the lively waves and lumbered along </p><p>with a foaming wake that gladdened the </p><p>skipper’s heart. True, the short-handed </p><p>crew had to work the pumps a bit every </p><p>day and the awful provender kept con- </p><p>tinuous nausea aboard, but the master felt </p><p>that the worst was over and he waited for </p><p>the anticipated climax calmly. </p><p> It came on the hazy morning of the</p><p>thirteenth day when the old schooner was </p><p>loafing her way into Sangar Strait. Fifty </p><p>miles northward, beyond the vague curtain </p><p>of haze that hid Volcano Bay, lay the island </p><p>of Yezo; seventy miles straight ahead was </p><p>Hakodate; and forty miles southeast was </p><p>Cape Shiriya, northern rampart of Hondo, </p><p>the mainland of Japan. Between the in- </p><p>visible landmarks stretched the gray-blue </p><p>sheet of water clear to the western horizon, </p><p>where a faint patch of dark smoke hung </p><p>low in the heavy air. The old schooner’s </p><p>booms were slatting to port and starboard, </p><p>sparring for puffs of wind, and the three </p><p>jibs dawdled limply from the foremast. </p><p>The ship was making bare steerage-way. </p><p> At ten o’clock Riley took his sight at</p><p>the blurred sun and established position </p><p>while Blazon napped below, Big Frank </p><p>lounged in the waist of the ship, and the </p><p>Slovak smoked lazily at the wheel. Whisky </p><p>Bill and the Greek were supposed to be </p><p>sleeping in the forecastle. </p><p> Suddenly, yelling at the top of his voice,</p><p>the Greek burst out of the forecastle door, </p><p>with a faint wisp of smoke following his </p><p>shoulders. Big Frank jumped toward him</p><p>and Riley, at the poop, lowered his sextant </p><p>and knew the moment had come. His </p><p>pistol was in his pocket but he kept it there. </p><p> “Fire!” yelled the Greek, breaking for</p><p>the steps to the poop. “Fire forward! </p><p>Fire!” </p><p> At the first shout Big Frank joined him</p><p>and started aft, also yelling. The speed </p><p>in their actions showed that quick develop- </p><p>ments were expected, and out of the tail </p><p>of his eye Riley noted that the falls of the </p><p>whaleboat were arranged for a quick </p><p>launching of the craft. He knew the men </p><p>would jump up the starboard steps and </p><p>On Short Allowance </p><p>hi </p><p>rush for that boat, and they did, and the </p><p>helmsman joined them, while from the dark </p><p>space beyond the forecastle doorway poured </p><p>a denser column of smoke. </p><p> Riley sought the port steps and rushed</p><p>for the deck. Once there he ignored the </p><p>excited group at the whaleboat and hurtled </p><p>toward the forecastle, where the smoke </p><p>became denser. As he reached the door </p><p>another figure came out, running head </p><p>down. </p><p> “Halt!” yelled Riley.</p><p> Whisky Bill looked up, saw the master,</p><p>and stopped. </p><p> “Is the fire out?” snapped Riley.</p><p> “Mostly,” said Bill, grinning. “What</p><p>comes next, sir?” </p><p> “You’ll shtop laughin’ before them</p><p>thraitors on the poop see ye!” commanded </p><p>the irascible skipper, laying a heavy hand </p><p>on his shoulder. “You’re bein’ forced into </p><p>the flamin’ ruins by an overbearin’ and </p><p>heartless tyrant, so they’ll not wait for ye!” </p><p> He heaved Bill into the smoky forecastle</p><p>and tumbled in himself, closing the door. </p><p> The light from the blurred hatch above</p><p>disclosed a strange sight to the coughing </p><p>skipper. On the aisle between two rows </p><p>of aged and smelly bunks stripped of their </p><p>cheap blankets and quilts lay a pile of half- </p><p>blackened, smoldering wet cloth and papers, </p><p>leading to an oil can half-full of liquid ten </p><p>feet away. Arising from the floor, Whisky </p><p>Bill started to tip the contents of the can </p><p>on the smoking embers. Riley jumped </p><p>and grasped his hand wrathfully. </p><p> “Dhrop that!” he roared. “Are ye</p><p>crazy?” </p><p> “Aw’right,” obeyed Bill, “only it’s</p><p>water.” </p><p> “Water?”</p><p> “Sure. That’s my idea, sir. I told the</p><p>others we’d better light the rags an’ run</p><p>a slow trail to the oil-can, so she’d explode </p><p>sure inside of a minute. Then the fire’d </p><p>be too big fer you to control when you got </p><p>here. See? They said I was one bright </p><p>guy. So I poured the oil out o’ the can an’ </p><p>slipped water in. Then I stuck some oil </p><p>around under the bunks to make it smell </p><p>right. See?” </p><p> The revelation floored Riley.</p><p> “By all the saints!” he exclaimed, slump-</p><p>ing against a bunk. “I’d never think it </p><p>was in ye! You’re a jewel, me lad—a </p><p>jewel!” And he slapped the man’s back </p><p>affectionately. </p><p> Footsteps pattered on the deck outside</p><p>and a hand fumbled at the door-latch, and </p><p>the two men straightened suddenly. The </p><p>door opened and the round face of Journet, </p><p>the cook, peered in owlishly. </p><p> “I theenk I hear noise,” he explained</p><p>when he saw who was inside. “Some men, </p><p>they leave very fast in a boat, sir. What </p><p>is it?” </p><p> “It’s throuble,” said Riley. “The crew’s</p><p>deserted. Here—” and he handed the </p><p>astonished cook the pistol—“take this and </p><p>see that no one comes aboard.” </p><p> Then Riley turned to Bill.</p><p> “Now that they’ve gone we’ll go out-</p><p>side,” he said. “Go you into the cabin, </p><p>wake Blazong, and bring up all the arms </p><p>you can get. Then go aft and ’wait orders. </p><p>Let no one come aboard. Undershtand?” </p><p> Bill nodded and accompanied Riley on</p><p>deck while the bewildered cook stood and </p><p>fingered the unaccustomed pistol specu- </p><p>latively. Without a glance at the whale- </p><p>boat being rowed frantically a quarter-mile </p><p>away, Riley climl&gt;ed to the deserted poop </p><p>and took the wheel, slowly swinging the </p><p>dynamite-ship back into her old course. </p><p>And then, looking past the three big masts </p><p>and the jibs, Riley’s eyes widened. </p><p> Coming on with a bone in her teeth and</p><p>a trail of black smoke pouring backward </p><p>from thick stacks was a narrow-beamed </p><p>gray warship. She was still far away but</p><p>Riley saw she was headed in his direction </p><p>and wondered if she had noticed the de- </p><p>sertion of his crew; but just then, as Bill </p><p>and the sleepy Blazon came up the com- </p><p>panionway and joined the skipper, a puff </p><p>of wind whipped the waters toward the </p><p>schooner and caught the sails, making the </p><p>old ship heel with renewed life. </p><p> “That’s what I wanted!” muttered Riley,</p><p>as he spun the spokes of the wheel. “Now </p><p>we’ll show them scoundhrels a little </p><p>dishipline!” </p><p> OBEYING Riley’s hand the</p><p>schooner swung to port and began </p><p>Vjifw tQ overtake |_]1e laboring whaleboat. </p><p>Inch by inch, foot by foot, yard by yard </p><p>she gained on the astonished rowers until </p><p>the long bowsprit towered above them </p><p>and the big bows threatened to grind them </p><p>under. Then, while the alarmed men in </p><p>the boat were standing up and yelling </p><p>and their oars began to slip out of the </p><p>tholes, the master swung the schooner to </p><p>112 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>starboard, passing them on the broadside </p><p>but keeping a few yards away. </p><p> “Toss out a line!” roared Riley to Blazon</p><p>and Bill, and they hurled a slim rope </p><p>toward the whaleboat as the big ship </p><p>lumbered by. The Greek in the bow of </p><p>the smaller boat looked at Big Frank, in </p><p>the stern. Frank nodded and the Greek </p><p>made fast while Bill twisted the other end </p><p>of the line about a bitt by the stern of the </p><p>schooner. As the rope tightened it whipped </p><p>the smaller craft under the stern of the </p><p>dynamite-ship. </p><p> That was the moment Riley had been</p><p>waiting for. </p><p> “Now, ye sneakin’ scum, I’ve got ye</p><p>where I want ye—you threacherous </p><p>hounds!” he roared leaving the wheel and </p><p>shaking a fist over the stern. “You’ll shtick </p><p>in that boat and do penance across the whole </p><p>Japan Sea and then you’ll face a court— </p><p>you greasy swine! One wrong move and </p><p>I’ll hang you all. The first man that </p><p>thries to come aboard here will be shot, </p><p>and if any of ye thries to cut the boat </p><p>adlirift—Gawd help ye! Undershtand?” </p><p> In the stern of the whaleboat Big Frank’s</p><p>right arm' reached backward. Then the </p><p>skipper’s eye grew cold and he pointed an </p><p>automatic carefully while Blazon and Bill </p><p>stood ready to back him up. Big Frank’s </p><p>arm came half-forward with a big blue </p><p>revolver. With a shriek the Slovak rushed </p><p>upon him and grabbed at his wrist. </p><p> Faced at last with deliberate mutiny—</p><p>for a man in the crew had brought forth </p><p>a pistol against the master—Riley’s gray </p><p>eyes betrayed a flame that meant death for </p><p>somebody; and yet his voice was soft. </p><p> “Throw that gun overboard,” he purred,</p><p>“or I’ll finish the whole boatload of ye </p><p>right now.” </p><p> There was an instant of inaction. The</p><p>upturned face of Big Frank was livid with </p><p>rage but his wrist was frantically held by </p><p>the terror-stricken Slovak, while the Greek </p><p>cowered in the bow. Then, sullenly, Big </p><p>Frank released his fingers from the ^pistol</p><p>and it dropped into the foanjing wake of the </p><p>pitching, tossing whaleboat. </p><p> “ ’Tis well,” Riley nodded to his com-</p><p>panions. “And now we’ll take turns at </p><p>guardin’ the shtern while the others work </p><p>ship. It’s short-handed we are—and Gawd </p><p>help us if there’s a blow—but praise be, </p><p>we’re rid o’ them mutineers at last. Hello— </p><p>what’s this?” </p><p> Looking forward, the trio perceived the</p><p>gray cruiser nearing them off the starboard </p><p>bow, with her clipper-prow slicing the </p><p>waves and her yards whipping backward </p><p>in the wind she created. From her taff- </p><p>rail snapped a red sun-flag with numerous </p><p>rays—the ensign of the Japanese navy. </p><p>Even as the three men watched her several </p><p>colored flags broke from the halyards over </p><p>her high bridge. </p><p> “That’ll be a Jap patrol-ship,” said Riley,</p><p>his eyes feasting on the trim lines of the big </p><p>cruiser with its guns peeping from case- </p><p>ments along the main deck. “Hello— </p><p>there’s signals. International code. They </p><p>want us to shtop! All right. Shtop it is!” </p><p>And he spun the wheel hard over. </p><p> The dynamite-ship swung into the wind</p><p>to starboard and the cruiser drew up until </p><p>the schooner’s men could see the blue-clad </p><p>Japs lounging about its decks. Then the </p><p>warship forged by and stopped, her wash </p><p>making the whaleboat bob up and down in </p><p>the water like mad. </p><p> Five minutes later a dark-skinned sub-</p><p>lieutenant scrambled aboard the sailing- </p><p>ship from a launch, followed by six natty </p><p>little armed sailors. With the dignity </p><p>befitting the master of a better ship the </p><p>trim Riley descended from the poop to </p><p>bow his visitors aboard and the Japanese </p><p>lieutenant returned the bow, coming to the </p><p>point without further parley. </p><p> “I regret arrest this boat,” said the</p><p>officer, bowing again in apology unutterable. </p><p> The blow took Riley aback.</p><p> “Arresht?” he exclaimed. “What for?”</p><p> The officer shrugged his shoulders and</p><p>pointed over the bulwark, toward the </p><p>cruiser.</p><p> “Captain Itsibuki talk Eenglees,” he</p><p>suggested. “You go now?” </p><p> Though polite the request was so terse</p><p>and full of meaning that the baffled Riley </p><p>wondered what his crime was. His mind </p><p>reverted to the happenings of the trip but he </p><p>found no clue. Resistance was impossible </p><p>and unjustified, though, so Riley deter- </p><p>mined to see this Japanese navy captain </p><p>and have it out. </p><p> “All right,” he sighed. “I’m ready as</p><p>soon as I get my papers. And by the way— </p><p>there’s some men undher the shtern that </p><p>need lookin’ after.” He pointed aft. </p><p>“Watch ’em while I’m gone. They bad </p><p>boys. You savvy?” </p><p> The Japanese bowed and grinned.</p><p>On Short Allowance </p><p>113 </p><p> ''Savvy, savvy, ” he rep] ied. “ I wa tch um</p><p> This done, Riley collected his papers and</p><p>started with Whisky Bill as companion </p><p>in the launch for the warship, the mate </p><p>staying with the schooner. All the way </p><p>across the master tried to conjecture what </p><p>it was all about and he kept wondering </p><p>until ushered into the sacred quarters of </p><p>the grizzled, mustached Japanese captain. </p><p>Then Riley stood literally on the carpet, </p><p>scenting the faint odor that permeates </p><p>every Oriental habitation, while the navy </p><p>man lolled in a swivel chair behind a fine </p><p>roll-top desk. To the rear of Riley stood </p><p>Whisky Bill and two Japanese orderlies. </p><p> “You are Captain Riley,” tolled off the</p><p>navy man, in precise English. “You com- </p><p>mand the Experiment, schooner, owned by </p><p>Peter F. Slemm of San Francisco. You </p><p>left that port April second with dynamite </p><p>and gunpowder for the Export Transporta- </p><p>tion Department of Russia. Is that cor- </p><p>rect?” </p><p> “Yes,” said Riley. “What about it?”</p><p> “Ah!” said the officer, shrewdly. “We</p><p>shall see. You worked for Mister Slemm </p><p>long?” </p><p> “This is my-first trip undher him and my</p><p>lasht!” </p><p> The officer’s slightly slanted eyes looked</p><p>more interested. </p><p> “What is that?” he asked softly.</p><p> “The ship, the grub, the men and the</p><p>owner!” said Riley. “I’m a sailor, not a dog!” </p><p> And then, with tongue loosened at last</p><p>and his outraged temper up, Riley burst </p><p>forth into vituperation of Slemm that </p><p>would have made that person’s hair curl, </p><p>while the officer smiled Orientally. Riley </p><p>did not know what had taken him under </p><p>the eyes of a world power; he only felt </p><p>himself a catspaw in some game that was </p><p>beyond his ken, played by a fat wolf of an </p><p>owner without morals or scruples, and the </p><p>skipper wanted to keep clear of its after- </p><p>math. From the man before him Riley</p><p>expected neither sympathy nor enmity. It </p><p>was a naval officer on duty. </p><p> “Go on,” said the officer, offering a seat</p><p>when Riley had finished. “Tell me about </p><p>your voyage across. I think something </p><p>must have happened.” </p><p> Seeing he should tell the truth soberly</p><p>and without trimmings, Riley started at </p><p>the beginning and recited the whole story. </p><p>At times he saw a peculiar light flashing </p><p>in the brown eyes of the Japanese officer, </p><p>8 </p><p>but the latter said nothing until Riley </p><p>was through. Then the navy man picked </p><p>some papers out of a pigeonhole and faced </p><p>the merchant skipper again, adjusting </p><p>spectacles judicially. </p><p> “You are sure the food caused all the</p><p>trouble?” asked the officer, peering over the </p><p>spectacles and smiling. </p><p> “Why, of course,” replied Riley, dis-</p><p>gruntled because his story was questioned. </p><p>“What else? Wasn’t the grub rotten bad? </p><p>If ye think different, try it!” </p><p> “And your cargo was for Russia?” per-</p><p>sisted the officer. </p><p> “Certainly,” said the irritated Riley.</p><p>“Don’t ye believe it?” </p><p> “Yes,” nodded the officer, politely. “And</p><p>this man—Big Frank—tried to bum your </p><p>ship two times because of the food?” </p><p>cSRjj THE Oriental officer’s faint smile </p><p>was bland but Riley sensed the </p><p>’• undercurrent and scratched his head </p><p>thoughtfully. </p><p> “Well, what else can it be?” he hazarded.</p><p>“I do not know. I am not sure. There </p><p>was an agent who did certain evil work </p><p>for a hostile foreign power and he left San </p><p>Francisco very secret in the first part of </p><p>April while American officers were looking </p><p>for him very hard. It may not surprise </p><p>you, but America is now at war with the</p><p>nation he worked for. When you left port </p><p>it was not. But even then the American </p><p>laws were very badly broken by this man. </p><p>They thought he left on some ship but </p><p>they never found him. </p><p> “Now suppose,” and the eyes of the</p><p>Japanese were thoughtful, “suppose this </p><p>man got on a schooner and then found </p><p>it was dynamite and gunpowder for Russia, </p><p>our ally. Would an agent for a hostile </p><p>foreign power want the cargo to reach </p><p>Russia? I think not. I think he would </p><p>use any means to prevent it. And suppose </p><p>the food was not good and gave excuse for </p><p>making trouble? Suppose he thought him- </p><p>self able to destroy your ship and get away </p><p>safely in a small boat?” </p><p> With eyes opening, Riley caught sight of</p><p>dangers that might have engulfed him and </p><p>was staggered. </p><p> “Wow!” he gulped. “I wondher if it’s</p><p>thrue? If it is-” </p><p> “Wait!” said the officer. “I can describe</p><p>this agent. He has been looked for every- </p><p>where. Was he tall and with curly hair </p><p>U4 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>and very blue eyes and a blunt nose? Was </p><p>he stooped somewhat in the shoulders? </p><p>Did he have a little linger only half as long </p><p>as it should be?” </p><p> “He did!” breathed the sober Riley.</p><p>“It’s Gawd’s truth. That’ll be Big Frank </p><p>to a hair!” And Whisky Bill echoed him. </p><p> The Japanese officer allowed himself</p><p>another cryptic smile and, without com- </p><p>ment, opened a roll of paper and began </p><p>reading slowly, translating Oriental char- </p><p>acters into English as he went along. The </p><p>subject was foreign to all that had gone </p><p>before and as the others listened they won- </p><p>dered what it was all about. </p><p> “Michael Onstorff, traitor to Russia,”</p><p>murmured the reading officer. “Born in </p><p>the Baltic provinces and educated at </p><p>Dantzig. Held positions in diplomatic </p><p>service until 1905, when he went into what </p><p>you call the Department of the Interior </p><p>of Russia. In 1913 he traveled in Afghan- </p><p>istan and India. In 1914 he received high </p><p>position in the Siberian service. After that </p><p>certain shipments of explosives went in </p><p>secret from Vladivostok to men very busy </p><p>with plots of enemies of the Allies in British </p><p>colonies, especially India. Michael On- </p><p>storff was caught at it and shot at Vlad- </p><p>ivostok by the Russian garrison on May </p><p>fourth, while you were at sea.” And the </p><p>officer closed the paper with a snap. </p><p> “Gee!” exclaimed Whisky Bill, while</p><p>Riley scratched his head and wondered how </p><p>to figure it all out. </p><p> “Onstorff,” continued the imperturbable</p><p>Japanese officer, “was the Export Trans- </p><p>portation Department of the Russian Gov- </p><p>ernment. There never was such a depart- </p><p>ment. It was—what you call—a graft </p><p>on the side. It sent out munitions to be </p><p>used by the enemies of England, Russia, </p><p>Japan and the Allies.” </p><p> Riley’s face lit with new vision as he</p><p>began to understand the real mission of </p><p>his ship, but, turning it over in his mind, </p><p>he found one question would not down. </p><p> “And Peter F. Slemm, the golden-</p><p>hearted shipowner—how about him?” </p><p> “I can not tell,” admitted the Japanese.</p><p>“Maybe he thought he was very shrewd </p><p>making big profit from the Russians. </p><p>Maybe he did not know the truth. Very </p><p>few did.” </p><p> “Then,” shouted Riley, excitedly, “Big</p><p>Frank didn’t know it and double-crossed </p><p>his own people by trying to smash the ship </p><p>they’d paid for—the people who’d gain by </p><p>receivin' the cargo! Lord, what a mix-up! </p><p>He didn’t know who the cargo was for! </p><p>It’s the joke of the year—he didn’t know it!” </p><p>“He could not have known or else he </p><p>would have been the most obedient man </p><p>on your ship,” said the officer, soberly. </p><p>“And now,” he added, rising, “I have the </p><p>great regret to keep you under arrest until </p><p>the courts decide your case. We will take </p><p>your schooner into Hakodate for examina- </p><p>tion. For yourself the arrest is only for a </p><p>time, until the courts make a ruling. I </p><p>fear no bad results for you, for your story </p><p>seems to fit in every way. And after the </p><p>way you saved your cargo, the Russian and </p><p>Japanese Governments owe you a very- deep </p><p>debt.” The officer bowed gracefully. </p><p> “Right,” murmured Riley, returning the</p><p>bow and preparing to leave, “and mebbe </p><p>some time I’ll command a real ship that’s </p><p>not run so cheap.” </p><p> The officer’s eyes met Riley and the</p><p>officer understood. </p><p> “There are five big full-riggers to be</p><p>delivered to English owners by the Kobe </p><p>shipyards within a month, and trained </p><p>masters are hard to find these days,” he </p><p>said, bowing again. “I would be much </p><p>pleased to use my not small influence to </p><p>get you to command one.” </p><p> That ended the interview and lightened</p><p>Riley’s heart till it sang within him, for he </p><p>knew his work was not in vain. Thus he </p><p>went with his satellite up to the spotless </p><p>quarter-deck of the cruiser and lounged by </p><p>the breech of the big stern gun, watching </p><p>a group of figures being shunted into a navy </p><p>launch from a slattern schooner near-by. </p><p>One of the figures had its wrists bound and </p><p>squirmed in resistance, but it hurtled into </p><p>the launch just the same.</p><p> “That,” murmured Riley, judicially, “is</p><p>a result of cheapness—the cheapness of a </p><p>money-grubbin’ human shark in the first </p><p>place. Cheap ship, cheap food, cheap men, </p><p>and I drew Big Frank because of it. Re- </p><p>member this all your life, me lad—little is </p><p>good that comes cheaply!” </p><p> “Yeh?” challenged Billy Kenyon, Whisky</p><p>Bill no longer, “how about me?” </p><p> “You?” And the master’s face became</p><p>soft as he faced the man. “That’s right. </p><p>You’re different. I’ll train ye for a mate’s </p><p>papers. Little is good that comes cheap— </p><p>but sometimes there’s a pearl in the gullet </p><p>of a swine.” </p><p>FOR THE FLAG d four-parisioryrjl </p><p>fay Thomas Addisojy </p><p>Author of “The Boss of Penvdenille,” “G 2-Defective,” etc. </p><p>The first part of the story quickly retold in story form </p><p>pATE pulls the strings of human destinies and </p><p>the puppets at the ends of them move in ignor- </p><p>ance of the force they are elected to serve. </p><p> Such a victim was James Perry, Jr., of Norfolk,</p><p>Virginia. Convalescing from pneumonia he sailed </p><p>South and landed at Cortina, the seat of Government </p><p>of Zanhoria, Central America, the early part of April. </p><p> By a darkened bedroom window in her home in</p><p>the Calle Dolores, Winifred Brewer stood look- </p><p>ing out across the public park. It was eleven </p><p>o’clock, the hour of retiring. A man’s white-flan- </p><p>neled figure loomed in the rays of a street lamp. </p><p>As he passed a poinsettia thicket a hand shot out. </p><p>The man fell. Hands dragged the body swiftly </p><p>into the bushes. </p><p> Screaming, the girl ran downstairs and out into</p><p>the street. She did not stop for her father, who, </p><p>alarmed at her outcry, had appeared in the hall </p><p>below. In the street Winifred ran into Enrique </p><p>Segovia. Together they searched the park and </p><p>found Jimmy Perry prone under some bushes. </p><p>Perry’s head was bleeding from the blow. He had </p><p>been robbed. </p><p> In Walter Brewer’s home Jimmy’s wound was</p><p>treated. He introduced himself to his host and </p><p>rescuers. Leaving the house, Enrique asked </p><p>Jimmy if the latter remembered reading of a Wil- </p><p>liam Bowman, a Richmond real-estate dealer, who </p><p>had absconded recently with a quarter of a </p><p>million dollars. Jimmy did. </p><p> Apprehended by the police, Juan Lopez, Jimmy’s</p><p>assailant, disclosed information that lead officials </p><p>to believe the Germans were trying to cause trouble </p><p>between Zanhoria and the United States. Jimmy </p><p>and Enrique planned, with the aid of officials, to </p><p>checkmate the conspiracy. </p><p> Intent on calling on Miss Brewer, Jimmy was told</p><p>she and her father had deserted the house in the </p><p>Calle Dolores. </p><p>AT THE Banco Nacional, Jimmy and Enrique </p><p>conversed with Senor Morales, the bank presi- </p><p>dent, and were introduceed to Miss Mary Taylor, a </p><p>traveler and author. Miss Taylor was the guest </p><p>of Senor and Dona Morales, having just arrived</p><p>from Guatemala. </p><p> Mopping the perspiration from his face, Sefior</p><p>Morales flipped from his pocket a card, bearing the </p><p>letters “D—VIII—K.” Jimmy picked it up and </p><p>returned it to the banker. </p><p> From the bank, Jimmy went to the American</p><p>Legation to call on the Hon. John Henry Lane, </p><p>United States Minister to Zanhoria. </p><p> Closeted with the minister Jimmy asked him to</p><p>send in the official code to Washington a letter to his </p><p>father. Mr. Lane granted the request. Jimmy ex- </p><p>plained what he had learned about the German </p><p>conspiracy. </p><p> In the street again, Jimmy saw Winifred Brewer</p><p>drive by in an automobile and stop at a pharmacy. </p><p>He hastened to her and petitioned her and her </p><p>father’s assistance to foil the German plot. She </p><p>pledged herself to the cause. </p><p> The Brewers’ new home, she told Jimmy, was at</p><p>the Rafael Fernandez hacienda on the Santa Marta </p><p>Road. </p><p> Shortly after President Wilson made his speech,</p><p>prior to the United States’ declaration of war on </p><p>Germany, Jimmy, Enrique, Don Luis Valera, Secre- </p><p>tary of State, and Don Emilio Ortega, State Super- </p><p>intendent of Police, questioned Lopez about what </p><p>he knew of the conspiracy. </p><p> Lopez told of secret meetings of five mysterious</p><p>men at Senor Morales’ home. From his descrip- </p><p>tion one of the conspirators was recognized as Herr </p><p>Adolph Kaufman, the German minister. At this </p><p>juncture, Jimmy told of the card bearing the letters </p><p>“D—VIII—K.” </p><p> “Ah!” said Enrique. “It is simple. D stands</p><p>for Domingo (Sunday). Thus, Domingo—the </p><p>eighth—Kaufman. Kaufman writes to Morales </p><p>from Arraca and sets a date for their meeting.” </p><p> Arraca was a German lumber camp on the Rio</p><p>Negro River. </p><p> Zanhoria’s sympathies, Senor Valera explained,</p><p>were with the United States, and the German </p><p>115 </p><p>116 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>scheme was to overthrow President Hurango of the </p><p>Republic and place a German sympathizer at the </p><p>head of the Government. By this means, Kaufman </p><p>hoped to foment revolutions in Central America </p><p>and thus divert a part of the United States’ forces </p><p>from her allies abroad. </p><p> The proposal to kidnap Kaufman was then made</p><p>by Jimmy. He called on Brewer to obtain the use </p><p>of the hacienda as a prison for the German minister. </p><p>Brewer consented. While on the way to the haci- </p><p>enda, Jimmy met Mary Taylor, who broached him </p><p>for a ride in his automobile. He declined grace- </p><p>fully. </p><p> Driving away from the Brewer place, Jimmy</p><p>passed Miss Taylor, out riding in Senor Morales' </p><p>car. She nodded to the American. </p><p> “I lied to her and she caught me,” wailed Jimmy</p><p>as he sped toward Cortina. </p><p>CHAPTER IX </p><p>MISS MARY TAYLOR PASSES </p><p>SIMMY returned the automobile </p><p>to the garage, and walked back </p><p>to his hotel. He was on the </p><p>point of entering when he heard </p><p>his name called. He swung around, and </p><p>saw Enrique approaching. </p><p> “I thought you were about due,” he said</p><p>as he came up. “Hit it pretty close, </p><p>didn’t I?” </p><p> “You’re a marvel,” Jimmy told him.</p><p>“Let’s go to my room. I need a tubbing </p><p>after that drive.” </p><p> When they were behind the closed door</p><p>of the bedroom Segovia put an eager </p><p>question— </p><p> “Were you successful?”</p><p> “Yes. They will stand in with us tooth</p><p>and nail.” </p><p> Jimmy stepped into his bathroom and</p><p>turned on the water. When he came back </p><p>he said: </p><p> “I’ve got to do Brewer justice, Enrique.</p><p>He came to the scratch like a man. Con- </p><p>found it, I’m sorry for him. He’s paying </p><p>an awful price for his liberty. He </p><p>shows it.” </p><p> “Did he suspect you?”</p><p> “I took good care that he didn’t. I</p><p>believe, though, Miss Brewer would be </p><p>glad to know that I knew. It’s hard for </p><p>her to act a he. The thing is eating her </p><p>heart out. I’ll be with you in a minute.” </p><p>Jimmy had slipped off his clothes while </p><p>he was speaking. He went into his bath, </p><p>and Segovia lit a cigaret and waited. He </p><p>took a newspaper from his pocket, folded </p><p>it to a certain point, and mused over a </p><p>short article his procedure had exposed. </p><p>After a lusty splashing in his tub Jimmy </p><p>came out. </p><p> “I say, old man,” he broke forth, “isn’t</p><p>there another way to reach the Santa </p><p>Marta Road than by the Avenue Alex- </p><p>ander?” </p><p> “Yes, only I thought-”</p><p> “Oh, I saw the shack all right, but it cost</p><p>me a fib, and I got found out in it.” He </p><p>grinned at Segovia’s puzzled look, and </p><p>started dressing. “Miss Taylor,” he went </p><p>on, “was in front, and I stopped and spoke </p><p>with her. That’s what did the business </p><p>for me. I ought to have put on more speed </p><p>instead of slowing down.” </p><p> “What did you say?” In this newer</p><p>interest Segovia forgot the paper he was </p><p>holding. </p><p> Jimmy sketched the interview lightly,</p><p>omitting as immaterial the incident of the </p><p>rose. </p><p> “And by George,” he added, “I ran</p><p>plump into her as I was coming out of </p><p>Brewer’s place. She and Mrs. Morales </p><p>were taking the air in the Morales car. </p><p>If she mentions it to you, Enrique, tell her </p><p>I was just poking about the country prying </p><p>into more nooks and comers. We don’t </p><p>want to advertise the hacienda at tins stage </p><p>of the game.” </p><p> Segovia delayed his answer until it caused</p><p>Jimmy to throw an inquiring glance at him.</p><p>Then it came. </p><p> “Why not tell Miss Taylor the truth?</p><p>She is American. You don’t have to talk </p><p>with her long to find out her detestation of </p><p>German methods in this world war.” </p><p>Jimmy in turn delayed his answer under </p><p>pretext of undoing a knot in his shoe-laces. </p><p>At last he said: </p><p> “Do you know, Enrique, I have arrived at</p><p>the conclusion that our friend Morales is </p><p>a deuced shrewd old bird. Here he has </p><p>an American as an intimate guest in his </p><p>home. Who would suspect him of plotting </p><p>against American interests? I wouldn’t </p><p>if I didn’t know what I do. And I rather </p><p>think you’d have hard work convincing </p><p>Miss Taylor of it. If you succeeded she </p><p>couldn’t stay on as Morales’ guest, and if </p><p>she left his house she would also have to </p><p>leave Cortina, or Morales would get wise </p><p>to what had happened. Then good-by </p><p>to the plans we’ve laid.” </p><p> Segovia was compelled to admit the force</p><p>For the Flag </p><p>117 </p><p>of Jimmy’s logic; but he made a weak stand </p><p>against it. </p><p> “I thought that if she knew she might</p><p>pick up some information for us. She is </p><p>in a position-” </p><p> Jimmy calmly interrupted him.</p><p> “You didn’t think any such thing,</p><p>Enrique. You said that without thinking. </p><p>To eat a man’s salt and spy on him isn’t </p><p>a job you’d set for your sister, if you had </p><p>one; and I’m blamed sure you wouldn’t </p><p>set it for Miss Taylor.” </p><p> “Oh, hang it, Jimmy, let’s drop it!”</p><p>exclaimed Enrique, reddening darkly. “I </p><p>hadn’t thought of it in that light. Here </p><p>is something that will entertain you—in </p><p>La Cronica, our leading newspaper. I </p><p>didn’t see it until after you’d gone.” </p><p> Jimmy could read Spanish better than</p><p>he could speak it. As he mastered the </p><p>interminable sentences of the little article </p><p>Segovia pointed out his face crimsoned with </p><p>annoyance. </p><p> In brief, Jimmy was hailed as the only</p><p>scion of a powerful American millionaire </p><p>with connections of political importance at </p><p>Washington. He was a young man of </p><p>brilliant parts and promise, and he was </p><p>now in Cortina to visit his old college class- </p><p>mate in Virginia, the Senor Don Enrique </p><p>Segovia. The two were to be the guests </p><p>at dinner on Thursday night at the home </p><p>of the Senor Don Manuel Morales, the </p><p>eminent banker, where Mr. Perry would </p><p>have the pleasure of meeting a fair com- </p><p>patriot, Miss Mary Taylor, the distin- </p><p>guished author and traveler who was but </p><p>just arrived in Cortina from an extended </p><p>stay in Guatemala, and who was the </p><p>honored guest of the Senora Dona Morales. </p><p> “Great snakes!” sputtered Jimmy. “Who</p><p>the devil put this rot in the paper about me?” </p><p>“I wondered,” said Segovia. “Mr. Lane, </p><p>do you think?” </p><p> “Lane? He’s not a fool!” snapped</p><p>Jimmy. “Who wants to be paraded in</p><p>print like this at any time, and especially </p><p>at a time when one seeks to move about </p><p>with as little noise as possible? Lane </p><p>knows that. This is some of Morales’ </p><p>doings, Enrique. He has made me a </p><p>marked man, and under the cover of a </p><p>compliment. A friend of the nephew of </p><p>the secretary of state—look out for him! </p><p>It’s a warning to the anti-administration </p><p>crowd.” </p><p> “It does look like it,” agreed Segovia.</p><p>“I wish they’d start something in the open. </p><p>This waiting gets on my nerves.” </p><p> “And mine,” echoed Jimmy. “I’m pray-</p><p>ing for Kaufman to come back harder than </p><p>I ever prayed for a touchdown. Oh, I say! </p><p>I haven’t told you about the dandy bird- </p><p>cage I’ve found for our Hun. We got </p><p>shunted off from it.” </p><p> He recounted the pertinent details of his</p><p>visit to Brewer, and described the strong- </p><p>room, and the defensive properties of the </p><p>house. They discussed the possibility of </p><p>a rescue party, and Segovia expressed him- </p><p>self as heartily in favor of arming the de- </p><p>fenders of the rural citadel. He could </p><p>manage easily to get the rifles. He would </p><p>speak to his uncle about it, or to Ortega. </p><p> “Of course I shall be with you, Jimmy,”</p><p>he declared when their conference was </p><p>ended. “I am a private citizen now, and </p><p>can do as I please.” </p><p> He glanced at his watch and got up.</p><p> “Of course you won’t be with us,” con-</p><p>tradicted Jimmy. “Your place is here </p><p>in the city to ward off suspicion from the </p><p>farm. If we both disappear along with </p><p>Kaufman it will give his friends a twin clue </p><p>to follow.” </p><p> “It doesn’t seem fair, but I suppose you</p><p>are right,” conceded Segovia reluctantly. </p><p> “That’s a good boy.” Jimmy grinned</p><p>at him, and added artfully—“By the way, </p><p>I forgot to tell you that the automobile </p><p>took Miss Taylor’s eye immensely—espe- </p><p>cially when she learned that it was yours.” </p><p>Segovia tried to appear unconcerned in </p><p>the face of this announcement. </p><p> “I’m glad she liked it,” he said carelessly.</p><p>“And that reminds me: I’m due in half an </p><p>hour to drive Miss Taylor to the State </p><p>Department to see my uncle. She wants </p><p>to ask him questions about the country— </p><p>things like that.” </p><p> Jimmy clapped him 011 the shoulder.</p><p> “Go to it, old man! We are here today</p><p>and gone tomorrow. In between we’ve </p><p>got to show some speed or we won’t get </p><p>anywhere. Let’s go down and have some- </p><p>thing with a lime and a straw in it before </p><p>you start. I’m dry as a boneyard.” </p><p>AFTER Enrique had gone Jimmy </p><p>cast about him for something to do </p><p>that would while away the time. </p><p>It was twelve o’clock. </p><p> “Billy Smith!” he ejaculated. “Amusing</p><p>little beggar. I’ll have him to lunch.” </p><p>118 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> He called up the legation. Smith of</p><p>Pittsburgh himself answered. </p><p>“Oh,” he said when he learned who it </p><p>was, “you’re the powerful son of that </p><p>brilliant millionaire I’ve been reading about. </p><p>Gosh, I’m all swelled up at knowing you.” </p><p>“Stow it,” Jimmy bade him. “I’m </p><p>thinking of having lunch. Will you-” </p><p> A whisper broke in on him.</p><p> “His nibs isn’t here. Gone to the State</p><p>Department. Business or something.” </p><p>“By George, that’s funny,” spoke out </p><p>Jimmy before he thought. He pictured a </p><p>meeting with Miss Taylor. </p><p> “A scream, ain’t it?” concurred Smith.</p><p>“John Henry thinks he’s working.” </p><p>“Confound you,” Jimmy shot at him, </p><p>“see if you can listen to me ten seconds </p><p>without butting in. I was up early, and </p><p>I’m getting hungry. Will you come over </p><p>and have lunch with me? That’s what I </p><p>started out to say when you-” </p><p> “Say no more, or you may take it back,”</p><p>entreated Billy earnestly. “I’ll fix it up </p><p>with Whittaker and come on the run. And </p><p>I’ll think up the most expensive dishes on </p><p>the way. What is money to the powerful </p><p>son of a-” </p><p> “Go to the devill” Jimmy barked at him,</p><p>and hung up. </p><p> Half an hour later they were seated</p><p>companionably by a wide, shaded window </p><p>in the Europa’s dining-room with a bottle </p><p>of Moselle between them. Except for </p><p>themselves the place was deserted, for the </p><p>hour was early for luncheon. They had </p><p>finished their cold consomme when Billy </p><p>remarked: </p><p> “Look here, Jimmy, why is Lane asking</p><p>for a warship off Puerto Mono. Oh, you </p><p>needn’t look innocent. It was after your </p><p>jazz with his mightiness yesterday that he </p><p>sent the cable. Whittaker told me.” </p><p>Jimmy answered him frankly.</p><p> “I can’t talk about that, Billy.”</p><p> The other’s broad face beamed.</p><p> “Good for you! I like you all the better</p><p>for it. But I just want to observe that </p><p>I’m not as blind as a bat or as deaf as a post, </p><p>and I know something is up. What it is I </p><p>can’t guess; but if it comes to a show- </p><p>down, and I can help, remember, please, </p><p>my name and address. I speak German,” </p><p>he supplemented with a knowing nod. </p><p>“There are one hundred thousand of them </p><p>in Pittsburgh, thirty thousand foreign- </p><p>born.” </p><p> “I won’t forget,” Jimmy assured him</p><p>warmly. </p><p> “Perhaps I ought to tell you,” added</p><p>Billy with a half-defiant, half-apologetic </p><p>air, “that my grandfather was a full- </p><p>blooded German—from Wurttemberg. His </p><p>name was Wilhelm Schmidt. I’m the </p><p>Americanized edition. And if you ask me </p><p>I’ll say that I’m not ashamed of my German </p><p>descent, but—” he rapped the table with </p><p>his knuckles—“I’m a Yankee from my </p><p>gizzard out, and I’ll fight anv man who says </p><p>I’m not.” </p><p> Jimmy reached over and seized- his</p><p>hand. </p><p> “Not me, old chap. We stand shoulder</p><p>to shoulder. Old Glory forever!” </p><p> Both were on their feet with the words.</p><p>“Old Glory—God bless it!” responded </p><p>Billy. He drained his glass, and snapped </p><p>the stem. </p><p> They went on with their lunch in new</p><p>good-fellowship, and with an exchange of </p><p>those large views of life that are at once </p><p>the hope and hopelessness of youth. Then </p><p>came a sudden digression. </p><p> “Ha!” exclaimed Billy. “I know that</p><p>girl with Lieutenant Segovia.” </p><p> In the street immediately in front of the</p><p>window an automobile had slowed down </p><p>for a jam at the hotel entrance. In the </p><p>waiting car were Segovia and Miss Taylor. </p><p>They did not chance to turn their eyes in </p><p>Jimmy’s direction, and they were gone</p><p>the instant after. </p><p> “You say you know the girl?” Jimmy</p><p>asked curiously. </p><p> “I mean,” Billy corrected, “that I’ve</p><p>seen her before. I don’t know her name.” </p><p>“Where did you see her?” </p><p> “In the Canal Zone. I took a run down</p><p>there last week. A little vacation. I got </p><p>back Monday. It was at the Gatun Locks </p><p>I came across her. Sunday morning. She </p><p>was off one of those Jamaica boats, I guess. </p><p>She didn’t see me; I was only a wart on </p><p>the water wall to her. But, by jinks, she </p><p>didn’t miss anything about the working </p><p>of the locks. She was in a regular trance </p><p>over it.” </p><p> “And did you see her after that?”</p><p> “No. She went on to Panama. I</p><p>didn’t. I’ve a friend on one of the ships at </p><p>Colon, and I wanted to look him up before </p><p>my boat left.” </p><p> Jimmy toyed with his coffee-spoon.</p><p> “Do you know,” he said presently, “I</p><p>For the Flag </p><p>119 </p><p>think you are mistaken in this girl who has </p><p>just passed.” </p><p> “Oh, sure,” snorted Billy aggrievedly.</p><p>“I wouldn’t know a good-looker like that </p><p>after only five days. I’d forget those cute </p><p>little curls, and—and by gosh, that sailor </p><p>hat with the Harvard ribbon. Oh, boy! </p><p>Ask me if I could be mistaken in my own </p><p>three sisters I’ve got at home. I’d swear </p><p>to her in a million!” </p><p> “Just the same you are barking up the</p><p>wrong tree, my lad,” insisted Jimmy. </p><p>You’ve read that nauseous article in La </p><p>Cronica: well, the girl you’ve just seen with </p><p>Lieutenant Segovia is Miss Mary Taylor.” </p><p>“What of it? Where' does that put me </p><p>in wrong?” demanded Billy. </p><p> “Why, Miss Taylor has just arrived here</p><p>from an extended stay in Guatemala, the </p><p>paper says; therefore she could not have </p><p>been at Gatun last Sunday.” </p><p> Billy leaned back in his chair and stared</p><p>at Jimmy. </p><p> “Pinch me!” he implored. “If what you</p><p>say is so I’m dreaming I made that trip to </p><p>the canal.” </p><p>CHAPTER X </p><p>THE CAMP AT ARRACA </p><p>AT YORO, on the line of the Cortina and </p><p>Puerto Mono railway, a branch line </p><p>strikes off to the southeast and after bump- </p><p>ing the unhappy traveler over thirty miles </p><p>of villainous road-bed brings him with a </p><p>final bump into the terminal station at </p><p>Arraca on the Rio Negro. Back of the </p><p>town, to the south and west, the virgin </p><p>forest extends in a mighty area unbroken </p><p>save for the black, deep waters of the river, </p><p>which creeps through it and out finally into </p><p>the jungles of the coast levels, and on to </p><p>the Caribbean Sea where it debouches </p><p>twenty miles below Puerto Mono. </p><p> The German syndicate’s timber conces-</p><p>sion lay on both sides of the Rio Negro </p><p>beginning at a point one mile above Arraca. </p><p>It was verboten to the townspeople, and to</p><p>all strangers unless provided with a permit </p><p>from the intendant at the Arraca Road </p><p>gate. The tract was heavily wired off in </p><p>the neighborhood of the town, and rangers </p><p>saw to it that other points of access were </p><p>guarded from intruders. </p><p> For two years now the operations at the</p><p>camp had been as a sealed book to all but </p><p>those intimately concerned with them. </p><p>Rafts of valuable hardwood were floated </p><p>down the river to the sea, and there loaded </p><p>on waiting ships. This was public knowl- </p><p>edge. For the rest no one knew what </p><p>went on. But far in the timber there were </p><p>things to be seen worth while. </p><p> A great open square, like a military</p><p>parade-ground, bordered the river. On </p><p>one side were the bunk-houses of the </p><p>loggers. In each house, behind a locker </p><p>door, was a gunrack, and each gun in the </p><p>rack was a well-oiled Mauser. On the </p><p>other side of the square a row of small </p><p>cottages sheltered the gangmasters—offi- </p><p>cers’ quarters they would have been called </p><p>elsewhere. A large two-story structure </p><p>stood at the head of the square facing the </p><p>stream. The lower part was used as a </p><p>commissariat, and the upper part as a club- </p><p>house for those in authority. In the com- </p><p>missariat in addition to the usual stores </p><p>was a battery of machine guns cloaked care- </p><p>fully from view. </p><p> Down at the river a number of swift sea-</p><p>going motor launches were moored to the </p><p>landing-stage, and in midstream a big flat- </p><p>boat for floating freight up from the sea </p><p>swung to anchor. On the opposite river </p><p>bank were several huge metal tanks filled </p><p>with gasoline and petroleum. </p><p> All this paraphernalia, with the exception</p><p>of the guns, could have been plausibly </p><p>explained to a chance visitor, but not so the </p><p>stout mast with its wireless antenna that </p><p>rose high above the surrounding trees back </p><p>of the club-house. This apparatus was </p><p>assuredly an oddity in a lumber camp, and </p><p>hence the curious and uncurious alike were </p><p>halted at the concession gate. </p><p> In the late afternoon of the day on which</p><p>Jimmy Perry in Cortina was entertaining </p><p>at lunch his friend from Pittsburgh, Herr </p><p>Adolph Kaufman, the Imperial German</p><p>envoy toTZanhoria, was seated in a room </p><p>of the club-house on the Rio Negro. Led- </p><p>gers, balance-sheets and other business </p><p>records were spread out on the table before </p><p>him. Three men of a military carriage </p><p>bore the minister company. They were, </p><p>in fact, reservist officers of the imperial </p><p>army, though; here in Zanhoria they mas- </p><p>queraded as plain lumbermen. Kaufman </p><p>himself was anything but a martial figure, </p><p>yet in his day he had served with the colors. </p><p>He was short, and ruddy, with a paunch, </p><p>a beard, and heavy-lidded eyes under great </p><p>120 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>bushy brows—a coarse, gross, bowelless </p><p>product of beef and beer and overweening </p><p>racial self-sufficiency. </p><p> “I think we have finished, gentlemen,”</p><p>he said. “The affairs of the syndicate are </p><p>in satisfactory order, and my inspection </p><p>of the property shows that it is being </p><p>worked to the maximum advantage. Our </p><p>quarterly report will read well. I con- </p><p>gratulate you. As for the greater matter </p><p>which engages us, Senor Morales, as I have </p><p>told you, has had word from me to issue </p><p>a call to his committee for Sunday night— </p><p>a final consultation. After that it remains </p><p>only to hear from General Peralta, and </p><p>strike!” </p><p> “I suppose there can be no doubt of this</p><p>committee, Excellency, in the test?” It </p><p>was a question from one who sat directly </p><p>opposite the minister. </p><p> “If,” Kaufman answered direfully, “I</p><p>should give Hurango their names they </p><p>would be stood up to a wall and shot. I </p><p>could do it and sit safe myself. And they </p><p>know this. Yes, Captain Karsch, I am sure </p><p>of the committee—quite.” </p><p> A gaunt, towering man who had been</p><p>reflectively drawing on his pipe put it aside </p><p>and spoke. He had the brusk manner of </p><p>one who is accustomed to being heard. </p><p> “Let us recapitulate. General Peralta</p><p>is off Jamaica in his yacht Sea Bird with </p><p>fifty chosen men. Here at Arraca we have </p><p>four hundred and fifty men. And in the </p><p>capital we have one hundred and twenty </p><p>men detailed to strategic points at the given </p><p>moment. Ja wohl! On the night of the </p><p>designated day I will dispatch, by way of </p><p>the river to Puerto Mono, one hundred men </p><p>in command of Captain Karsch to seize the </p><p>cable station and cover Peralta’s landing </p><p>with their machine guns. </p><p> “I will leave fifty men to patrol the camp,</p><p>and with the rest take possession of the </p><p>railroad, cut the telegraph, and proceed to </p><p>Cortina. On the Pacific slope Lieutenant </p><p>Baer will take care of the Cortina and </p><p>Boaco Railroad. This will complete the </p><p>investment of the city. Before aid can</p><p>reach Hurango we shall have Peralta in his </p><p>chair—that is, if Morales and his people </p><p>do their part. Am I correct, Herr Kauf- </p><p>man?” </p><p> “With two small exceptions, Colonel</p><p>Ludolf.” </p><p> “And they are?”</p><p> “The Zanhorian National Guard for one.”</p><p> “PoojI” Colonel Ludolf blew the Guard</p><p>into ineffectual fragments. “A mere </p><p>rabble.” </p><p>“THEY are six hundred strong </p><p>I_; j in Cortina,” said Herr Kaufman </p><p> *	quietly. “We are counting on de-</p><p>fections to Peralta, but not until he is at </p><p>the gates of the city.” </p><p> “Poo/I” scoffed the officer again. “We</p><p>shall take the town by surprise, under </p><p>cover of darkness. We shall have the </p><p>arsenal. What can they do against us? </p><p>Your other point, if you please.” </p><p> “The designated day. That is an un-</p><p>known quantity as yet. And everything </p><p>hinges on it. If the legation wireless had </p><p>not broken down I would have had news </p><p>from General Peralta by this. Miss Prietz </p><p>has undoubtedly arrived in Cortina from </p><p>Jamaica with letters from him—informa- </p><p>tion he would not dare wire from the Sea </p><p>Bird. It may be that we shall hear at any </p><p>moment now.” </p><p> The fourth man, considerably younger</p><p>than the others, had been listening in </p><p>silence. He ventured a remark here, a </p><p>pleasantry, it seemed. </p><p> “Haven’t we in all this overlooked the</p><p>Zanhorian navy, Excellency?” </p><p> Kaufman chuckled at the sally. The</p><p>Zanhorian navy consisted solely and wholly </p><p>of an antiquated gunboat—a relic of the </p><p>Spanish-American war—mounting one four- </p><p>inch gun fore and aft, and a secondary </p><p>battery of three-pounders. </p><p> “Our U will attend to the navy, if neces-</p><p>sary, Karl,” he said. “But I am informed </p><p>by the Peralta party at Puerto Mono that </p><p>they have Admiral Terrozas well in hand. </p><p>They probably have promised him a second- </p><p>hand torpedo boat to add to his fleet.” </p><p> The laugh that greeted this was checked</p><p>by a knock at the door. </p><p> “Come in!” called Ludolf.</p><p> The wireless operator entered. He</p><p>saluted, tendered the colonel a code mes- </p><p>sage he had just taken, and retired. </p><p> “Ha! From Cortina!” exclaimed the</p><p>minister. </p><p> “No. From the U,” announced the</p><p>colonel. He deciphered the dispatch. </p><p>Kaufman looked his disappointment. </p><p> “Where is von Kumpel?” he inquired</p><p>sourly. </p><p> “At his base, Matina Cay. He asks</p><p>for oil.” </p><p>m </p><p>For the Flag </p><p>121 </p><p> Matina Cay was a palm-grown islet forty</p><p>miles off the mouth of the Rio Negro. </p><p>Ludolf turned to the young man Kaufman </p><p>had addressed as Karl. </p><p> “See to it, Lieutenant Hecht—two hun-</p><p>dred gallons. Be ready to start at dark. </p><p>Show the usual lights when you have </p><p>cleared the river.” </p><p> Hecht left the room. Colonel Ludolf</p><p>drew a sheet of paper to him, and set about </p><p>answering the submarine. </p><p> “Have you any word for Kumpel?” he</p><p>inquired of Kaufman. </p><p> Kaufman thought a moment.</p><p> “I am returning to Cortina on the evening</p><p>train, and shall see Miss Prietz tomorrow,” </p><p>he said presently. “You might say to von </p><p>Kumpel that he shall know ‘the day’, it is </p><p>likely, by tomorrow night.” </p><p> Colonel Ludolf prepared his message, and</p><p>requested Captain Karsch to see that it </p><p>was sent. When Karsch was gone he said </p><p>to the minister: </p><p> “It is not possible that Hurango is totally</p><p>in ignorance of our movements. The thing </p><p>is unbelievable. And yet, you say, there is </p><p>no evidence;of disquiet in his official family.” </p><p>“I repeat it,” Kaufman stated gruffly. </p><p>“Our precautions have been such that not </p><p>a whisper has reached them. If it were </p><p>otherwise there would be some stir in the </p><p>departments. All is quiet as the grave.” </p><p>Ludolf knitted his brows. But he knew </p><p>Kaufman. Argument would only irritate </p><p>him. </p><p> “And the American envoy, is he too</p><p>asleep?” he asked. </p><p> “Lane!” Kaufman pursed his mouth</p><p>in a poof of his own. “He snores—‘ein Narr </p><p>sein Lcben lang.' ” </p><p> The officer smiled his recognition of the</p><p>phrase, and rose. </p><p> “If you must take that train, mein Herr,</p><p>we had better be moving,” he suggested.</p><p>“The horses are ready.” </p><p> Herr Kaufman lifted himself from his</p><p>chair in quick response. </p><p> “I wouldn’t miss it for tiie ‘Black</p><p>Eagle’,” he declared. “Miss Prietz will </p><p>have news for me. A remarkable woman, </p><p>Colonel. Jat The best, I believe, that </p><p>we have on this side the water. She has </p><p>done excellent work in all the Isthmian </p><p>States. They will fall in line if Peralta </p><p>succeeds. Then we shall see—eh—the </p><p>‘United States of Central America.’ And </p><p>confusion at Washington.” </p><p> Colonel Ludolf came to a salute. His</p><p>eyes glittered. </p><p> “Hoch dcr Kaisert” he intoned in his</p><p>heavy bass. </p><p> He marched to the door, and stood aside.</p><p>Kaufman bowed and passed out before him. </p><p>He walked with a slight limp. </p><p>A MAN loitered along the platform </p><p>as the train for Yoro and Cortina </p><p>pulled out. When it had bumped </p><p>around the curve beyond the water-tank </p><p>the man loitered on to the post-office in the </p><p>public square and asked for a telegraph </p><p>blank. On this he wrote: </p><p> Look for your package on Arraca train tonight.</p><p> The telegram was addressed to a cigar</p><p>store on the Plaza Central in Cortina. </p><p>CHAPTER XI </p><p>THE WOMAN IN GRAY </p><p>JIMMY and Billy Smith were lounging </p><p>over their after-luncheon cigars in the </p><p>rotunda of the Europa when the hotel motor </p><p>bus deposited at the door a lone woman </p><p>guest. A page received her suit-case and </p><p>conducted her to the desk. She was an in- </p><p>conspicuous little body in traveling gray. </p><p>As she passed them Jimmy noticed that </p><p>she was not old, and that her face was small </p><p>and dark and plain. At the same instant </p><p>he was conscious of being swept in by </p><p>eyes—himself and Billy and the entire place </p><p>—with one swift, comprehensive glance. </p><p> “German,” murmured Billy.</p><p> “No; Cuban. Spanish blood anyway,”</p><p>said Jimmy. </p><p> “Cigars on it.”</p><p> “Done!”</p><p> They were too far away to catch her con-</p><p>versation with the clerk, one Mr. Ricardo </p><p>Gomez, who spoke half a dozen languages </p><p>with a reckless fluency that answered for </p><p>whatever shortcomings of construction it </p><p>betrayed; but when at length the page had </p><p>led the lady to the ascensor to be taken up </p><p>to her room Billy sauntered over to the </p><p>desk. He came back after a few minutes. </p><p>His short nose was twitching comically. </p><p> “We both lose,” he stated.</p><p> “What is she?”</p><p> “Guess. She is registered as Mrs. Re-</p><p>becca Isaacs of New York. Speaks English, </p><p>Ricky says, as well as he does.” </p><p>122 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Jimmy laughed.</p><p> “I’ll buy just the same. But I say, this</p><p>is the train I came in on. There’s no boat </p><p>due to-day.” </p><p> “Elders &amp; Pinsch Line—freight from</p><p>Jamaica,” Billy told him. “Good old scows, </p><p>if you are not looking for speed. Well, I’ve </p><p>got to toddle along or Whittaker will be hav- </p><p>ing a fit. Any message for his loftiness?” </p><p> “Only my love,” Jimmy grinned. “Come</p><p>on and have your cigar.” </p><p> “I guess not,” returned Billy indignantly.</p><p>“If I do belong to the down-trodden poor I </p><p>can still manage to find the price of a smoke </p><p>for a rich friend. I got it off of Whittaker </p><p>before I came around here.” </p><p> Jimmy knocked about the lobby list-</p><p>lessly for a while after Billy had left him. </p><p>Time hung heavily on his hands. He had </p><p>no appointment with Enrique for the after- </p><p>noon, but it was likely he would look him </p><p>up when he returned from his outing with </p><p>Miss Taylor. At night Enrique was to dine </p><p>with him at the hotel. </p><p> Jimmy yawned. He wished now that he</p><p>had gone with Billy to the legation. Lane </p><p>might have news of some kind to give him. </p><p>He might have heard from Washington. </p><p>Congress might have acted on the Presi- </p><p>dent’s war message. If it had Lane would </p><p>of course get immediate word. He glanced </p><p>at the office clock. It was 1130. No, Lane </p><p>probably was at lunch; or, possibly, he was </p><p>still at the State Department. </p><p> Jimmy decided to go up to his room and</p><p>take a siesta. Later he would walk around </p><p>to the legation. He had himself carried up </p><p>to his floor. As he stepped from the eleva- </p><p>tor he saw, issuing from the room across the </p><p>corridor from his, the new arrival. He lifted </p><p>his hat as they met, and then stopped sud- </p><p>denly and spoke. </p><p> “I beg your pardon—your glove.”</p><p> _ It had slipped from her hand as she passed</p><p>him. </p><p> “Thank you ever so much,” she said, and</p><p>proceeded to the waiting lift. </p><p> “New York all right,” Jimmy confided</p><p>to himself. “And not from Baxter Street. </p><p>Wonder what she’s doing down this way </p><p>alone?” </p><p> He made ready for his nap, and went to</p><p>the windows to darken them. As he stood </p><p>fumbling with the cords of the jalousies he </p><p>saw Mrs. Isaacs making her way from the </p><p>hotel across the plaza. He watched the little </p><p>gray figure indolently. It took the path </p><p>leading to the northeast corner of the square, </p><p>and disappeared in the Calle Commercio. </p><p> “Going to see Lane. Has troubles of her</p><p>own,” surmised Jimmy. “But she’ll have </p><p>to pass Billy first. I’d like to hear what he </p><p>says to her.” </p><p> He smiled sleepily, and turned to his bed.</p><p>IT SEEMED to Jimmy that he had </p><p>barely closed his eyes when he was </p><p>awakened by a pounding on the </p><p>door. The voice of Billy Smith came to him </p><p>demanding to know if he were alive or </p><p>dead. </p><p> “I was half-way between, contwist you!”</p><p>Jimmy shouted to him irately. “Can’t you </p><p>let a man have hjs nap in peace?” </p><p> He got up nevertheless, and opened the</p><p>door. </p><p> “Nap!” burst out Billy as he entered.</p><p>“If you started in when I left you’ve sawed </p><p>enough wood to build a house. It’s five </p><p>o’clock. Here’s a cable for you. It came </p><p>just as we were shutting up shop. And say, </p><p>the devil’s broke loose, it looks like. Lane </p><p>got a hurry-up call from the State Depart- </p><p>ment an hour ago, and went off in a cloud </p><p>of fuss and feathers.” </p><p> Jimmy was reading his cable. It was</p><p>from his father, and it said: </p><p> Satisfactory. Got a bet down on you.</p><p> “Good old dad!” he murmured affection-</p><p>ately. He looked up at Billy. “What were </p><p>you saying about Lane?” </p><p> Billy rolled his eyes ceilingward.</p><p> “I said he had a toothache, and had gone</p><p>to have it out.” </p><p> Jimmy threw a pillow at him.</p><p> “Talk sense, or I’ll drown you in the</p><p>bathtub. What has happened?” </p><p> “If I knew I’d be at the Department in-</p><p>stead of John Henry. It’s something Whit- </p><p>taker even doesn’t know. His- prominency </p><p>got a dispatch from Washington today in </p><p>the private cipher, and decoded it himself. </p><p>Then he went to see Senor Valera. Now </p><p>he’s gone again in answer to Valera’s S. O. S. </p><p>It’s to do with that dispatch or I’m a Hindu. </p><p>The warship maybe. What?” </p><p> “Maybe,” said Jimmy as he pulled on his</p><p>shoes, “they are getting up a dance. I’ve </p><p>known men to go off their heads over a thing </p><p>like that.” </p><p> “You go hang!” retorted Billy. He</p><p>perched himself on the writing-table and </p><p>swung his legs to and fro. “You can’t get </p><p>For the Flag </p><p>123 </p><p>by me with that sort of bunk. You’re </p><p>just as full of curiosity as I am to know </p><p>what’s doing.” </p><p> “Well, yes, I am,” conceded Jimmy.</p><p>“But I’m going to keep the cork in until it </p><p>will do some good to draw it.” He added </p><p>•with a tinge of seriousness—• “This war </p><p>we are in, Billy—or will be when Congress </p><p>acts—is going to start a lot of things to </p><p>happening.” </p><p> He plunged his face into the washbowl.</p><p>Billy regarded the broad shoulders turned </p><p>to him with schoolboy admiration. </p><p> “Yes, and right here,” he remarked when</p><p>Jimmy withdrew his face from the bowl. </p><p>“You said you wouldn’t forget me, and </p><p>take it from your Uncle Ezra, Mr. Ready- </p><p>cash, I’m not going to let you. I can shoot, </p><p>swim, sail a boat, drive a car, and I wouldn’t </p><p>balk at an airplane if 1 was put to it.” </p><p>“Shi” </p><p> Jimmy raised his hand. He had heard, he</p><p>thought, a movement just outside his door. </p><p>He strode to it, and opened it. A little </p><p>figure in gray was in the act of inserting a </p><p>key in the door across the hall. Her back </p><p>was to him, and he drew in quietly. </p><p> “What the Sam Hill ails you?” queried</p><p>Billy. </p><p> Jimmy softly lowered his transom. Then</p><p>he said with a lurking grin: </p><p> “I have a neighbor. A Mrs. Rebecca</p><p>Isaacs of New York.” </p><p> “Oh! So she’s on this floor?”</p><p> “As I have said. You had a call from her</p><p>this afternoon, something tells me.” </p><p>“Something lies to you then,” rejoined </p><p>Billy; but he evinced interest in this new </p><p>topic. “Queer! I was going to speak to you </p><p>about this Mrs. Ikev. What made you say </p><p>that?” </p><p> “A little while after you left I saw her go</p><p>out. She turned into your street. There </p><p>are no shops up that way, so I thought she </p><p>was going to you to have a grouch re-</p><p>moved.” </p><p> Billy grinned back at him.</p><p> “Wrong again. She didn’t stop. She</p><p>didn’t give us even a look. She went </p><p>straight on to the German legation and </p><p>blew in. I watched her. Struck me as kind </p><p>of funny, an American going into that joint. </p><p>I kept an eye open, but I didn’t see her </p><p>come out. Missed her, I guess. But she </p><p>couldn’t have been there all that time— </p><p>hardly.” </p><p> “Um,” grunted Jimmy. He was busy</p><p>with his cravat. “You said she came in </p><p>from Jamaica?” He was recalling what </p><p>Billy had surmised of Miss Taylor—that </p><p>she, too,' had come from the island. </p><p> “Ricky said she did,” the boy replied.</p><p>“She might have come from anywhere on </p><p>the Puerto Mono Road.” </p><p> “Arraca?”</p><p> “The German concession. Aha! I be-</p><p>gin to smell a mouse. And that warship! </p><p>Look here, Jimmy, is it because I’m in the </p><p>Service that you won’t let me in on what </p><p>is up?” </p><p> “Partly.”</p><p> The young fellow jumped down from the</p><p>table. </p><p> “Darn the Service!” he yapped. “I’ll</p><p>cut it, that’s what!” </p><p> “Not so loud,” Jimmy cautioned. “I’ve</p><p>a neighbor, please remember. And further- </p><p>more, my son, you’ll stick to that job of </p><p>yours, for a while anyway. I’ve made you </p><p>a promise I mean to keep, if I see a chance </p><p>to use you. That’s all you’ll get out of me </p><p>for the present. Will you be a good boy, or </p><p>won’t you?” </p><p> “I’ll be good,” vowed Billy meekly.</p><p> Jimmy put on his hat, and with a cat’s</p><p>tread went to the door. He opened it with </p><p>a quick jerk. </p><p> “I’m going down. Come on,” he said.</p><p> When for the second time that afternoon</p><p>he liad parted with Billy in the hotel lobby </p><p>Jimmy watched for a chance to speak pri- </p><p>vately with the clerk. He thought he had </p><p>seen Mrs. Isaac’s door close as he stepped </p><p>out from his room. Had she been listening </p><p>in the hall? </p><p> Jimmy acknowledged that the incident</p><p>in itself was trivial. He would not have </p><p>given it a thought were it not for what Billy </p><p>had told him of the woman’s visit to the </p><p>German mission. This nagged at his un- </p><p>derstanding; the fingers of his mind twid- </p><p>dled with it irresolutely. Why should thifc </p><p>person on the instant of her arrival in the </p><p>city seek out the representatives of a nation </p><p>with which her own country was on the </p><p>brink of war? It did not somehow look </p><p>right; and yet what was wrong with it? </p><p>Her errand may have been simply to ask </p><p>information on a business matter—Ger- </p><p>mans were active in business in all the Cen- </p><p>tral American States. </p><p> “Deuce take it,” he grumbled, “I asked</p><p>that boy to lunch for entertainment, and I </p><p>get a bunch of worries handed me. He saw </p><p>124 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Miss Taylor in the South when she came </p><p>from the North, and he saw this Mrs. Isaacs </p><p>hobnobbing with the Huns when she should </p><p>have been gossiping with him. I can’t </p><p>make head or tail of it.” </p><p> His opportunity came, and he went over</p><p>to the desk. </p><p> “I see you have another visitor from the</p><p>States,” he remarked casually to the mul- </p><p>tilingual Ricardo. </p><p> “Si, Mr. Perree. A lady with sorrows,</p><p>sir, from what I make intelligence. Un-tio </p><p>(a hunkle) who loses himself, and she have </p><p>make to trace him by Porto Rico, San Do- </p><p>mingo, Cuba, Jamaica—di grado in grado— </p><p>and now, enfin, she achieve to this locale.” </p><p>“Oh, she has heard of him then?” </p><p> “But a whisper, Mr. Perree. Some one</p><p>she have seen in Kingston have remark him </p><p>in Cortina at the German legation.” </p><p> “But she is an American, a Jew, from</p><p>New York. How is it that her uncle-■” </p><p> “Ah! I myself make question to her of</p><p>that con discrecion. He is born in Germany. </p><p>He departs away before the war. There is </p><p>property to divide, un hermano who dead is </p><p>in Chikkago. Her padre is enfermo, and she </p><p>must come with herself toule seule.” </p><p> “And what did she learn at the legation?”</p><p>Jimmy asked. </p><p> Mr. Gomez shrugged his shoulders to</p><p>his ears. </p><p> “No sc. She have her key, and do not</p><p>cease by me when she return.” </p><p> “I hope she finds him,” Jimmy said, and</p><p>walked away. To himself he said: “Jews </p><p>don’t send their women-folk chasing about </p><p>the world alone. It sounds pretty thin to </p><p>me.” </p><p> He brought up with a grunt of surprise.</p><p>Segovia was coming toward him, and his </p><p>air was anxious and harassed. </p><p> “Hello!” Jimmy saluted him. “I wasn’t</p><p>expecting you till seven.” </p><p> Segovia drew him aside.</p><p> “The dinner must wait,” he said. “My</p><p>uncle desires to see you. It is important. </p><p>Will you come at once, Jimmy, please?” </p><p> “I certainly will. Do we drive?”</p><p> “No. W'e will walk. We must avoid at-</p><p>tention.” </p><p> “Then laugh a little,” prompted Jimmy,</p><p>“and we’ll ease out of this as if we were </p><p>going on a lark, and not to a funeral. Act </p><p>the part, Enrique.” </p><p> He followed his own advice, and Segovia</p><p>made out to play up to him. When they </p><p>were in the street they strolled west along </p><p>the square to the Calle Central. Here they </p><p>turned northward. Jimmy seized the op- </p><p>portunity when no one was within close </p><p>hearing to put the question that was clamor- </p><p>ing in him for utterance. </p><p> “What has broken loose, old man? Slip</p><p>it to me with a smile—the world is looking </p><p>on.” </p><p> Segovia endeavored to comply, but his</p><p>smile was more of a grimace than a gladden- </p><p>ing twist of the features. </p><p> “An important State paper is missing</p><p>from my uncle’s office,” he said. “A Wash- </p><p>ington dispatch. Mr. Lane brought it. </p><p>The devil of it is, Jimmy, Uncle Luis missed </p><p>it only a short time after Miss Taylor and I </p><p>were there. He sent for me, but there was </p><p>nothing I could tell him, of course. How </p><p>could there be? The thing is past under- </p><p>standing.” </p><p> Jimmy did not comment on this. In-</p><p>stead he asked— </p><p> “Do you know what the paper was</p><p>about?” </p><p> “My uncle will tell you,” Segovia an-</p><p>swered. “But in a word, it was a warning </p><p>to our Government saying that General </p><p>Peralta is in Jamaica, and is planning an </p><p>armed descent on Zanhoria.”</p><p> Jimmy whistled softly.</p><p> “So they got on to it in Washington! By</p><p>Jove, Uncle Sam isn’t so slow as the Ger- </p><p>mans think he is!” </p><p>CHAPTER XII </p><p>THE STOLEN STATE PAPER </p><p>THEY came finally to the Plaza Mayor, </p><p>with the Government buildings to the </p><p>east and west, and the executive mansion, </p><p>embowered in its gardens, to the north. </p><p> “We are going to Don Luis Valera’s</p><p>office?” queried Jimmy who until now had </p><p>manifested no curiosity touching their des- </p><p>tination. </p><p> “No,” Segovia replied. “We are going</p><p>to see the president. We will slip in by the </p><p>side entrance. We are expected there.” </p><p> “Um, the devil is to pay sure enough!”</p><p>exclaimed Jimmy to himself. </p><p> Still pursuing their role of leisurely pedes-</p><p>trians taking the evening air they sauntered </p><p>across the great square with its bronze </p><p>equestrian statue of Franciso Zamora, the </p><p>liberator, and debouched at the east end of </p><p>For the Flag </p><p>125 </p><p>the White House of the Zanhorian Repub- </p><p>lic. They strolled north along the low gar- </p><p>den wall. As they came to an opening in it </p><p>Segovia stopped. A sergeant of police was </p><p>loitering toward them. Segovia spoke to </p><p>him, a low-breathed word. </p><p> "Vayase” he answered, and passed on.</p><p> “Quick! In with you,” Segovia said to</p><p>Jimmy, and followed on his heels. </p><p> They were swallowed up in the shrubbery,</p><p>and made their way swiftly to a door under </p><p>a small portico at the farther end of the walk. </p><p> They were, as Segovia had said, expected.</p><p>The door opened as they approached. A </p><p>man in plain black, who stood unobtru- </p><p>sively back in the entrance, looked narrowly </p><p>at Segovia, bowed, and noiselessly closed </p><p>the door after them. He conducted them up </p><p>a corridor and across a colonnaded patio in </p><p>which a tinkling fountain made pleasant </p><p>music. A lemon-tree grew by the fountain, </p><p>and there were roses and jasmine in bloom </p><p>all about. Above the first stars were blos- </p><p>soming in the sky. </p><p> From the patio they entered another cor-</p><p>ridor, and were invited into a waiting-room </p><p>overlooking the court. Their attendant </p><p>disappeared. A moment later a young man </p><p>came in. He bowed ceremoniously to </p><p>Jimmy, and went with extended hand to </p><p>Segovia. </p><p> “Ola, amigo! Como le va?” he exclaimed</p><p>cordially. </p><p> Segovia introduced him to Jimmy. He</p><p>was the Senor Don Leon Machada, Presi- </p><p>dent Hurango’s private secretary. After </p><p>a few courteous words he begged the young </p><p>men to follow him. They passed down to </p><p>the end of the corridor and were ushered </p><p>into a spacious rose-tinted chamber where, </p><p>advancing to meet him, Jimmy beheld the </p><p>Hon. John Henry Lane. There were three </p><p>others in the room—Don Luis Valera, Don </p><p>Emilio Ortega, and a massive old man with </p><p>piercing black eyes, and a lined, strong face. </p><p>He had risen as the secretary announced </p><p>the callers and, with a friendly gesture to </p><p>Segovia, stood waiting, his eyes intent on</p><p>Jimmy. </p><p> Mr. Lane had received a personal cable</p><p>that afternoon from Senator Perry. It com- </p><p>mended Jimmy to his care, and he was glow- </p><p>ingly filled with the responsibility. He con- </p><p>ducted his charge to the fine old man tower- </p><p>ing above his entourage. </p><p> “Mr. President,” he said unctuously, “I</p><p>have the honor to present Mr. James Perry, </p><p>Jr., of Virginia. His father is one of our </p><p>very influential citizens, and his uncle, </p><p>United States Senator Allan S. Perry, is </p><p>chairman of the Senate Committee on For- </p><p>eign Relations.” </p><p> President Hurango shook hands with</p><p>Jimmy. </p><p> “You are very welcome, Mr. Perry. I</p><p>speak your tongue but indifferently, though </p><p>I am better, I hope, in the understanding </p><p>of it.” </p><p> “Sir,” replied Jimmy, with an aptness</p><p>which astonished himself, “if I could say in </p><p>as good Spanish what you have just said in </p><p>English I should consider myself a master </p><p>of the language.” </p><p> A smile went the ’round of the room.</p><p>Mr. Lane swelled with pride. The chief </p><p>executive was manifestly pleased. </p><p> “Thank you,” he said simply. “Please</p><p>sit down, Mr. Perry.” </p><p> The door was again opened by the private</p><p>secretary, and a seventh man was shown in. </p><p>He wore a wax-pointed mustache, and car- </p><p>ried himself, Jimmy fancied, a little pre- </p><p>tentiously. He brought his hand up in a </p><p>military salute to the president. This cere- </p><p>mony performed he bowed to the others of </p><p>the group, and strode forward. He was. </p><p>Jimmy learned when presented to him, </p><p>General Don Alfredo Barrios, Minister of </p><p>War and Marine. </p><p> A silence settled on the company. Presi-</p><p>dent Hurango motioned to Don Luis Valera, </p><p>who turned to Jimmy. </p><p> “This, Mr. Perry, is a secret conference</p><p>to decide on a line of action for the protec- </p><p>tion of the State. His Excellency the presi-</p><p>dent has been made aware of your interest in </p><p>the events that are pending, and the patri- </p><p>otic reasons that influence you. It is be- </p><p>cause of this that he has requested the honor </p><p>of your presence. He wished to be made </p><p>acquainted with you.” </p><p> Jimmy was in something of a flutter at</p><p>the attention concentrated on him; but he </p><p>bowed his acknowledgment, and Don Luis </p><p>proceeded. </p><p> “We have come to a pass in which it is</p><p>necessary to abandon the pretense of official </p><p>ignorance of what you propose, though at </p><p>tiie same time we must continue to main- </p><p>tain the appearance of it. In short, Mr. </p><p>Perry, our hand has been forced, and yet </p><p>not to the point where we can take open </p><p>action against our enemies. His excellency </p><p>the American minister will perhaps be good </p><p>126 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>enough to explain what has transpired to- </p><p>day.” </p><p> Lane, not in the least unwilling to take</p><p>the center of the stage, hemmed with for- </p><p>ensic momentousness and began. </p><p>ESS “I RECEIVED, James, a dispatch </p><p>MjgP from the State Department at Wash- </p><p>ington, and was charged to transmit </p><p>it without delay to the Zanhorian Govern- </p><p>ment. This disptach stated that informa- </p><p>tion had reached Washington from a reliable </p><p>source to the effect that General Frederico </p><p>Peralta is in hiding on the southern Jamai- </p><p>can coast with certain followers, and is plan- </p><p>ning a descent on Zanhoria. In support of </p><p>this news was the further information that </p><p>a large white yacht has been seen standing </p><p>off and on in the neighborhood, presumably </p><p>to take on the Peralta party when they are </p><p>ready to launch their coup.” </p><p> “How about the Jamaican Government?”</p><p>asked Jimmy as the minister paused. “Do </p><p>they know this?” </p><p> “The Crown governor has been informed</p><p>by Washington,” Lane replied, “and will </p><p>doubtless take steps to thwart the filibus- </p><p>ters if he is not too late. Peralta has </p><p>chosen, no doubt, an inaccessible point for </p><p>his rendezvous. It is in view of these facts, </p><p>James, that we are met here tonight. The </p><p>dispatch that I handed to his excellency, </p><p>Senor Valera, today is missing from his </p><p>office, or, rather, one of the three copies </p><p>made of it by his excellency’s secretary for </p><p>the various departments of the Govern- </p><p>ment has disappeared. </p><p> “I presented the note to Senor Valera at</p><p>one o’clock. We were in conference on it </p><p>until two. Between those hours—nearer </p><p>one than two, I should say—Senor Segovia </p><p>and Miss Mary Taylor called. Senor Va- </p><p>lera sent out a request to his nephew to re- </p><p>turn later, and—” Lane came to a pause; </p><p>then he added—“and that, I believe, Mr. </p><p>Secretary, is the extent of my personal </p><p>knowledge of the—ah-ahumph—calamity </p><p>that has befallen.” </p><p> “Good Lord,” thought Jimmy, “won’t</p><p>they ever get to the point!”</p><p> It was on the tip of his tongue to put the</p><p>question that was once propounded by a </p><p>celebrated personage of his own country— </p><p>“Who do you suspect?” But he checked </p><p>the impulse. These diplomats had their </p><p>ways, and who was he to try to change </p><p>them? </p><p> Senor Valera took up the thread of the</p><p> American minister’s narrative.</p><p> “My confidential secretary was at his</p><p> lunch during the time of his excellency’s</p><p> call on me. He came in shortly afterward,</p><p> and I instructed him to copy the note in</p><p> triplicate. Meanwhile the Deputy Senor</p><p> Carrera from the Province of Puerto Mono</p><p> came in to see me. His errand was of im-</p><p> portance, and we were in consultation for</p><p> upward of an hour.</p><p> “It was during our conference that my</p><p> secretary placed the note and copies on my</p><p> •desk. As the Senor Carrera withdrew, my</p><p> nephew and Miss Taylor were again an-</p><p> nounced. I invited them in with the inten-</p><p> tion of asking Miss Taylor’s indulgence if I</p><p> begged her to postpone our appointed in-</p><p> terview to another day. At this moment</p><p> Senor Carrera reappeared at the door.</p><p> There was something he had omitted to</p><p> say, and I stepped outside to hear him.</p><p> The papers remained on my desk.</p><p> “I was gone possibly five minutes. When</p><p> I returned I spoke with Miss Taylor briefly,</p><p> after which she and my nephew departed.</p><p> I went into my secretary’s room to say a</p><p> word to him, and then made ready to de-</p><p> liver in person a copy of the note to the</p><p> president, and another afterward to Gen-</p><p> eral Barrios at the War Department. It</p><p> was at this juncture that I discovered that</p><p> one of the three copies was missing.”</p><p> The room was still as Don Luis finished.</p><p> Jimmy glanced at Enrique. He returned</p><p> it with a somber look. Senor Ortega, Jimmy</p><p> observed, was lying back in the corner of a</p><p> small wicker canape, his eyes half-closed.</p><p> The war secretary was fingering his mus-</p><p> tache with ill-concealed impatience. Presi-</p><p> dent Hurango sat impassively in his great</p><p> armchair so placed that it commanded the</p><p> entire company. He spoke.</p><p> “I deemed it proper that you should learn</p><p> in detail these facts, Mr. Perry. I have but</p><p> one question to ask—these friends at the</p><p> Rafael Fernandez hacienda—you can rely</p><p> on them?”</p><p> “They are Americans, sir,” said Jimmy.</p><p> There was the flash of a smile in Ortega’s</p><p> eyes at the response. The president bowed,</p><p> and turning from Jimmy addressed the com-</p><p> pany in general.</p><p> “We are not so much concerned at pres-</p><p> ent with the identity of the person who ab-</p><p> stracted the dispatch as with the effect the</p><p> information it gives will have upon the</p><p>For the Flag </p><p>127 </p><p> enemies of the State. It will, I am inclined</p><p> to believe, precipitate action on their part.</p><p> Our consideration should be directed, then,</p><p> to the specific means of circumventing them</p><p> before they can strike.”</p><p> The war secretary was not in favor of</p><p>secret measures, it appeared. </p><p> “I would suggest the immediate suspen-</p><p>sion of the civil authority,” he put forth in </p><p>Spanish, and with a fierce twirl of his mus- </p><p>tache. </p><p> “Your Excellency!” It was Segovia.</p><p> He was on his feet, pale and greatly</p><p>stirred. </p><p>The president motioned him to proceed. </p><p>“I can not consent, sir,” Segovia said, </p><p>“to sit on in silence under the imputation </p><p>that rests upon myself and my companion </p><p>of the afternoon-” </p><p> “Enrique!” Don Luis Valera’s voice rose</p><p>in stem protest. “The president has dis- </p><p>posed of that question. And the country’s </p><p>welfare waits.” </p><p> “Your Excellency, may I not defend my</p><p>honor before you—now, while the lash </p><p>stings?” appealed the young man passion- </p><p>ately. “My life is my country’s, but my </p><p>honor is my own; can not my country spare </p><p>to me a moment for the defense of that </p><p>without which my life is an unworthy gift </p><p>to her?” </p><p> The old man in the chair inclined bis head</p><p>to him in grave sympathy. The hot blood </p><p>had once burned in his own veins, and he </p><p>remembered it. </p><p> “Speak on, Don Enrique,” he invited,</p><p>“though I will say that your loyalty has not </p><p>for an instant been in doubt.” </p><p> “Then, sir, it is a question of probity be-</p><p>tween the Deputy Senor Carrera and Miss </p><p>Taylor. There were no other callers. Senor </p><p>Valera accounts for the deputy. I account </p><p>for Miss Taylor. Which of the two, may I </p><p>inquire, is accused—the deputy or Miss Tay-</p><p>lor?” His tone was derisive as he challenged </p><p>the faces before him. </p><p>DON LUIS turned from him with </p><p>an expression of severe intolerance. </p><p>But the State superintendent of po- </p><p>lice, from his corner on the sofa, answered the </p><p>question with a question. It was gently put. </p><p> “You were seated, Don Enrique, while</p><p>awaiting the return of his excellency from </p><p>the door?” </p><p> “Yes, senor.”</p><p> “Near the desk?”</p><p> “Not far from it; at the end facing the</p><p>door.” </p><p> “And neither of you moved?”</p><p> Segovia hesitated, but it passed, and he</p><p>said— </p><p> “I crossed the room to draw a glass of</p><p>water from the cooler in the corner.” </p><p> “For Miss Taylor—at her request?”</p><p> “It was, Senor Superintendent.” There</p><p>was a strained sarcasm in the reply. “And </p><p>I will say—for it is that you are leading up </p><p>to,_ I infer—that my back was not turned to </p><p>Miss Taylor thirty seconds, if as much. </p><p>The lady is distinguished as an author, </p><p>senor, not as a prestidigitator.” </p><p> He sat down defiantly.</p><p> “No slightest offense intended, my dear</p><p>friend,” disclaimed Ortega blandly. “And </p><p>when you left the Department?” </p><p> “I drove Miss Taylor home.”</p><p> “To the Senor Morales’ house?”</p><p> “Yes, senor. She is the guest of the</p><p>Senora Morales; and I will call your atten- </p><p>tion to the outstanding fact that Miss Tay- </p><p>lor is an American, and entitled to the pro- </p><p>tection of his excellency here, the American </p><p>minister.” </p><p> The Hon. John Henry Lane moved un-</p><p>comfortably in his seat. To all, except the </p><p>obsessed Segovia, the deductions to be</p><p>drawn from the superintendent’s inquisi- </p><p>tion were obvious. Ortega relieved the </p><p>situation." He addressed the president in </p><p>mild regret. </p><p> “You see, sir, the mystery remains un-</p><p>solved.” </p><p> President Hurango, impassive as ever,</p><p>made a motion of assent. </p><p> “We will let it rest there until a more</p><p>convenient time. What we must consider </p><p>now are the steps for our defense.” </p><p> General Barrios answered him.</p><p> “I have had the honor, sir, to advance a</p><p>suggestion.” </p><p> The president shook his head.</p><p> “I am of the opinion, General, that the</p><p>better way is that with which I have ac- </p><p>quainted you. No overt act lias been com- </p><p>mitted. Toparade our strength might check </p><p>but would not end this revolutionary move- </p><p>ment. It would rise again. To put it down </p><p>quietly by removing the agent provocateur </p><p>from the scene appears to me the simpler </p><p>method—and the speedier.” He turned his </p><p>penetrating gaze 011 Minister Lane. “Are </p><p>you in accord with me, sir?” </p><p> The diplomat cleared his throat as if of</p><p>128 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>an obstruction that impeded a prompt re- </p><p>sponse. </p><p> “Er — ah — ahump — unofficially, Senor</p><p> Hurango, I may say that—er—ah—I am.”</p><p> The president let hi's eyes pass on to</p><p> Jimmy.</p><p> “Mr. Perry, I have decided to adopt your</p><p> plan. If you succeed, the unexpressed</p><p> thanks of two Governments will be yours.”</p><p> A snort that was converted instantly into</p><p> a cough proceeded from the direction of</p><p> General Barrios.</p><p> “It is not my plan, sir,” Jimmy hastened</p><p> to explain. “It is Enrique’s. He thought</p><p> of it.”</p><p> The old man looked at Segovia, and</p><p>nodded kindly. </p><p> “Yes, I know, and the hazard of it. We</p><p> shall do all that can be done to protect you.</p><p> Openly we shall be obliged to disavow an</p><p> act that is in violation of the laws of na-</p><p> tions. It is not an enviable position for us,</p><p> yet I am constrained, for the reasons ad-</p><p> vanced, to accede to it.”</p><p> A gentle tap was given at the door, and</p><p> Machada entered.</p><p> “A lieutenant of police has brought a</p><p> message for the senor superintendent,” he</p><p> announced.</p><p> He crossed to Ortega and handed him a</p><p> printed envelope.</p><p> “With your permission, Senor President?”</p><p> requested the superintendent.</p><p> He silently read the message-</p><p> Look for your package on Arraca train tonight.</p><p> Ortega glanced at Jimmy though his</p><p>words were for the president. </p><p> “Your Excellency, I am able to inform</p><p> you that the Imperial German minister is</p><p> returning to the city. He will arrive at ten</p><p> o’clock tonight.”</p><p> “The guns, Enrique! Kaufman won’t</p><p>wait for the eighth now,” cried Jimmy for- </p><p>getful of the presence he was in. </p><p> Enrique made him an assuring gesture.</p><p> He had recovered his poise, though his eyes</p><p> still gloomed. President Hurango rose.</p><p> “Gentlemen, I will call this meeting ad-</p><p> journed. I think that we shall find refresh-</p><p> ments in the adjoining room, if you will</p><p> honor me.”</p><p> As they went in Jimmy discovered Or-</p><p>tega at his side. Jimmy addressed him </p><p>eagerly. </p><p> “Why not tonight, senor?”</p><p> “Tomorrow night,” said the other.</p><p> “But I dine with Senor Morales tomor-</p><p>row night.” </p><p> “Will you wager with me on that, Mr.</p><p>Perry?” </p><p> “What! I say, you don’t think-?”</p><p> “If you will call at my office tomorrow</p><p>at eleven I will tell you what I think,” re- </p><p>plied Ortega with an obscure smile. “In </p><p>the meantime shall we lay the wager—say </p><p>a ripe banana?” </p><p> Jimmy laughed.</p><p> “Let’s be reckless. Make it two, the</p><p>loser to eat all four.” </p><p> But he wondered, nonetheless, what</p><p>Ortega could have up his sleeve. </p><p>CHAPTER XIII </p><p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS </p><p>*	| 'HE little company dropped away as</p><p>they had come, one by one, and on foot; </p><p>all with the exception of Jimmy and Sego- </p><p>via—they slipped away together. The </p><p>police sergeant was loitering on the oppo- </p><p>site side of the street as they came out of </p><p>the garden. Jimmy caught a glimpse of </p><p>him under a spreading crepe myrtle. </p><p> “There’s Don Emilio’s man again, piping</p><p>us off,” he observed, solely in the hope of </p><p>promoting conversation. </p><p> Enrique had held himself moodily aloof</p><p>in the dining-room. </p><p> “Ortega is an ass,” pronounced the Zan-</p><p>horian acidly. </p><p> “What kind?” chuckled Jimmy. “There’s</p><p>Balaam; his ass had better sense than he </p><p>had. Remember it?” </p><p> Segovia ignored the quip.</p><p> “Ortega is a stupid ass. Those ques-</p><p>tions he asked—a child wouldn’t have been </p><p>as silly. What did they lead to? Nothing, </p><p>except that Miss Taylor in half a minute </p><p>could have grasped the meaning of that </p><p>dispatch, stolen it, hid it away, and settled </p><p>back in her chair as cool as a block of ice. </p><p>In half a minute! It couldn’t have been </p><p>longer.” </p><p> They were passing under one of the Plaza</p><p>Mayor arc lights. Jimmy halted. </p><p> “Let us see how long half a minute ac-</p><p>tually seems,” he suggested. He had his </p><p>watch out. “Now!” </p><p> Segovia, interested curiously by the test,</p><p>pored upon the second hand as it traveled </p><p>its tiny orbit. The movement was prepos- </p><p>terously slow. </p><p>For the Flag </p><p>129 </p><p> “Half a minute!” Jimmy proclaimed at</p><p>last. “Quite some time when you come to </p><p>count it.” </p><p> He replaced the watch in his pocket and</p><p>they walked on. Segovia scowled at the </p><p>path ahead. </p><p> “Do you mean by that to impute-”</p><p> Jimmy cut him short.</p><p> “Look here, old chap, I’m not imputing</p><p>anything to anybody. But I want to im- </p><p>prove this chance to get something off my </p><p>chest; and I wouldn’t do it, please remem- </p><p>ber, if I didn’t think a whole lot of you. </p><p>Shall I go on?” </p><p> “As you wish.”</p><p> “All right. I wanted to say it to you</p><p>this morning, but I couldn’t see my way </p><p>to it then. Now I do see it. Enrique, if </p><p>I were you I wouldn’t get too thick with </p><p>Miss Mary Taylor.” </p><p> “That is entirely my affair,” Segovia an-</p><p>swered. “It can not possibly interest any </p><p>one but myself.” </p><p> His tone was coldly forbidding. Jimmy</p><p>braved it. </p><p> “But it interests me,” he persisted. “It’s</p><p>because I don’t want to see you left in the </p><p>discard when this big deal we are in on is </p><p>over. I’ll agree with you from the start in </p><p>everything you can say of Miss Taylor’s </p><p>personal charm. She’s handsome as a pic- </p><p>ture—all that—but when you come down </p><p>to bald facts what do you or I know of her? </p><p>Morales is a traitor to his country. I </p><p>wouldn’t believe such a man on his dying </p><p>oath. Why should I believe him when he </p><p>says Miss Taylor is, for instance, a distin- </p><p>guished writer?” </p><p> “She herself told us she was preparing</p><p>a series of articles for a magazine. And </p><p>she told my uncle so today.” </p><p> “Oh!” said Jimmy. “What is her maga-</p><p>zine? Did she say?” </p><p> “We didn’t get that far. The interview,</p><p>as you know, was brief.” </p><p> “Oh!” said Jimmy again. “And she</p><p>hasn’t mentioned it to you, or anything </p><p>about her work?” </p><p> “No. We talked of other things.”</p><p> “A rara avis, by Jove!” exclaimed Jimmy.</p><p>“People, let me introduce to your attention </p><p>a modest author. The only one at large.” </p><p>He laughed, though with a covert scru- </p><p>tiny of his friend. Segovia drew himself up </p><p>stiffly. </p><p> “I think we have pursued the subject</p><p>far enough,” he remarked. </p><p>9 </p><p> “Only one thing more,” Jimmy inter-</p><p>jected. “Miss Taylor says she is just ar- </p><p>rived from Guatemala. Billy Smith of the </p><p>United States legation says he saw her in </p><p>the Canal Zone on Sunday. How do you </p><p>account for that, amigo mio?” </p><p> Segovia stumbled in his walk, caught</p><p>himself, and went on. Jimmy could hear </p><p>the gasping breath he drew. </p><p> “Where, please,” he asked with forced</p><p>calm, “has Mr. Smith seen Miss Taylor in </p><p>Cortina?” </p><p> “He lunched with me today. You passed</p><p>our window in your car.” </p><p> “Mr. Smith must have been mis-</p><p>taken,” claimed Segovia with a desperate </p><p>hope. </p><p> “He says he’d swear to her in a million,”</p><p>Jimmy told him. “And for myself, I’ll </p><p>add that I don’t think she’s a born Ameri- </p><p>can. She has the lingo down pat, but </p><p>there’s a wee bit of an accent. It’s been </p><p>puzzling me. It may be Swedish, and </p><p>then again it may be German. I don’t </p><p>know.” </p><p> “Bosh!” shot out Segovia. “I haven’t</p><p>discovered any such thing. You are letting </p><p>your imagination run away with you.” </p><p> They strode on in silence for some time,</p><p>nearing now the Plaza Central.</p><p> “Hang it, old fellow,” Jimmy exploded</p><p>of a sudden, “I know how it is with you, </p><p>and I’m sorry. But don’t you see I couldn’t </p><p>keep mum about this thing? You might </p><p>let something drop—not meaning to, of </p><p>course—that would put us in the hole. I </p><p>had to tell you!” </p><p> “It’s all right, Jimmy,” Enrique said,</p><p>though he made a little difficulty of it. </p><p>“We won’t talk about it any more now, </p><p>please.” </p><p> “Right you are!” acceded Jimmy cheer-</p><p>fully. “And there’s the hotel. Come on </p><p>in and have an anisette frappe. It’s the </p><p>edge of the evening.” </p><p> “No, I guess not, thank you, if you</p><p>don’t mind. I’ll leave you and go </p><p>home.” </p><p> He wished to be alone, Jimmy saw. So</p><p>he said: </p><p> “It’s good-night, then, old scout. You</p><p>won’t forget about those guns, will you? </p><p>I’ve a notion we may need them sooner than </p><p>we thought.” </p><p> “It will be attended to,” Segovia an-</p><p>swered absently. </p><p> With this they parted.</p><p>130 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> THE young Zanhorian proceeded</p><p>down the Calle Central on his way </p><p>home. He walked slowly, revolv- </p><p>ing in his mind the disclosure Jimmy had </p><p>made to him. Of course Smith was mis- </p><p>taken, yet he cast back a little uneasily to </p><p>his conversation with Miss Taylor in his </p><p>car that afternoon. As he recalled it—and </p><p>with a flush of self-vexation—the talk was </p><p>largely about himself, his aspirations and </p><p>future plans; the kind of stuff a sympathetic </p><p>woman auditor encourages a man to en- </p><p>large upon. And, too, she had asked about </p><p>Jimmy Perry; but there was nothing singu- </p><p>lar in that. He was her countryman; it </p><p>was natural that she should show an inter- </p><p>est in him. </p><p> He recalled further that she had inquired</p><p>casually if he thought Zanhoria would side </p><p>with the United States in the war or remain </p><p>neutral; and if there were not rumors of </p><p>trouble in the country. She had heard </p><p>something of the sort in her journeyings </p><p>before coming to Cortina. Was it true, </p><p>or just political gossip? </p><p> It gratified him now to remember that he</p><p>had disparaged it, had in fact, conveyed to </p><p>her the impression that it was ridiculed by </p><p>the Government. On the other hand, he </p><p>was unable for the life of him to attach any </p><p>sinister significance to her question. There </p><p>were, as every one knew, rumors afloat of </p><p>trouble with Peralta, and if another had </p><p>asked his opinion of it he would have seen </p><p>nothing strange in it. Why, then, mistrust </p><p>Mary Taylor? </p><p> Segovia’s thoughts traveled on to the</p><p>missing Washington dispatch, and a doubt </p><p>assailed him. The devilish leisureliness of </p><p>that tiny hand on Jimmy’s watch-dial! It </p><p>could have been done in the time his back </p><p>was turned if one was skilled enough in such </p><p>things. But Mary Taylor! No, no, it </p><p>was inconceivable! And then came a sav- </p><p>ing thought. </p><p> “Valgame DiosI” he exclaimed, and</p><p>struck his fist triumphantly into his </p><p>hand. </p><p> They had only the word of his uncle’s</p><p>secretary that "three copies were made.</p><p>Don Luis had not said that he himself </p><p>counted them; he was engaged with a </p><p>visitor at the time. The secretary might </p><p>have made a mistake. He might have </p><p>made only two copies or, if three, he might </p><p>have mislaid one in the mass of papers on his </p><p>desk. It was possible—probable, in fact. </p><p>He would take the matter up with his uncle </p><p>in the morning. </p><p> Segovia in these communings had come to</p><p>the Avenida Alejandrino. He hesitated, </p><p>and turned into it. The day had been </p><p>warm. Mary might be out in front enjoy- </p><p>ing the evening cool. He might, indeed, </p><p>have a word with her. ■ </p><p> As he came to the house he caught sight</p><p>of spectral forms in the loggia—the ghostly </p><p>white of sheer lawn dresses. He stopped, </p><p>hung on his heel, then takiag hold of his </p><p>courage he started up to the door. There </p><p>was a movement in the loggia, the sound of </p><p>whispering voices, the scrape of a chair on </p><p>the floor. A man peered over the balus- </p><p>trade. It was Morales. </p><p> “Who comes?” he questioned.</p><p> The tone was not altogether friendly.</p><p>Segovia paused with the feeling that he was </p><p>an intruder. And yet the hour was not late. </p><p> “It is I, Senor Morales—Enrique Sego-</p><p>via,” he answered. </p><p> For the space of a breath there was no</p><p>response. One of the white-clad forms dis- </p><p>solved from view. Morales spoke again. </p><p> “Senor Segovia? Ah! Oh! This is an</p><p>unexpected pleasure, senor; a very delight- </p><p>ful surprise. One moment, please, and I </p><p>will be down. I regret to say that the Dona </p><p>Natalia is not at all well, or we should have </p><p>you up with us.” </p><p> “A thousand commiserations, senor, and</p><p>I beg of you do not disturb yourself,” put </p><p>in Segovia hastily. He had no itch for an </p><p>exchange of platitudes with the banker. </p><p>“I was out walking,” he continued, “and </p><p>seeing, as I thought, the ladies in the loggia, </p><p>I made bold to come in. Please assure the </p><p>Senora Morales of my very earnest sympa- </p><p>thies, and Miss Taylor of my profound re- </p><p>gard.”</p><p> He was turning away when a silvery</p><p>laugh rippled out to him. It was followed </p><p>by a delightfully mocking voice. </p><p> “And if Miss Taylor should choose to</p><p>receive the compliment at first-hand, Mr. </p><p>Segovia? She is not at all indisposed her- </p><p>self. Shall she give you proof of it by com- </p><p>ing down?” </p><p> “I desire it above all tilings,” said Sego-</p><p>via ardendy. </p><p> “Wait!” was the command.</p><p> There was silence overhead. Miss Tay-</p><p>lor, and likewise her host, had gone in. The </p><p>young man paced the transverse walk by </p><p>the door in high feather at his good luck. </p><p>For the Flag </p><p>131 </p><p> He was kept waiting some minutes, but at</p><p> last Miss Taylor came out and stood with</p><p> him under the stars.</p><p> “I have scandalized the dear people in</p><p> there,” she laughed. “They are not Ameri-</p><p> can-taught as you are.”</p><p> Enrique slowly relinquished the hand she</p><p> had given him.</p><p> “It’s awfully good of you,” he stam-</p><p> mered. “I don’t deserve it.”</p><p> “That sounds as if you had been thinking</p><p> unpleasant things of me,” she replied. “But</p><p> you have been walking; shall we sit down</p><p> for the small time I have. There is a bench</p><p> somewhere—ah, here it is. Now, tell me;</p><p> what are these unpleasant thoughts you’ve</p><p> had of me? Tell me!”</p><p> The bench was beneath the orange tree</p><p> under which Juan Lopez had concealed him-</p><p> self pn a Sunday night not long before. Miss</p><p> Taylor, as she urged her question, bent</p><p> toward her companion trying to read his</p><p> face in the dim light. Her breath caressed</p><p> his cheek, intoxicated him.</p><p> “I have had no such thoughts,” he swore.</p><p> “How could I? Why, I walked up this</p><p> way tonight just to be a little nearer to you.</p><p> I did not dare to hope for this.”</p><p> Her hand found his, rested 011 it, pressed</p><p> it softly. Before she could withdraw it he</p><p> had snatched it to his lips and covered it</p><p> with kisses.</p><p> “You silly boy,” she murmured, “it is</p><p> only a few hours since we were together.”</p><p> She disengaged her hand gently. “I have</p><p> been thinking of our call this afternoon,</p><p> and your uncle. We were horribly in the</p><p> way—I could see that—yet he was cour-</p><p> tesy itself. We shall go again, shall we</p><p> not, my friend? And those letters; he will</p><p> give them to me? They will help me so</p><p> much with my work.”</p><p> Even in the swirl of his intoxication En-</p><p> rique was penetrated with a ray of reason.</p><p>£ To confound Jimmy forevermore he must</p><p> resolve to nothingness the doubts cast upon</p><p> this glorious creature. One was already</p><p> dissipated; had she purloined the Washing-</p><p> ton dispatch she could never have spoken</p><p> with such serene unconcern of her call on</p><p> Don Luis. And she wished to call again!</p><p> Presto! That doubt was gone.”</p><p> “Of course we shall go,” he assured her.</p><p> “I will remind my uncle of the letters.</p><p> What is the name of your magazine? I</p><p> don’t think you have ever told me.”</p><p> She appeared surprised.</p><p> “Why, haven’t I! It’s the North Ameri-</p><p>can Gazelle of Philadelphia. A dreadfully </p><p>dry old thing, but amazingly respectable.” </p><p>“I can’t imagine you writing for it,” he </p><p>exclaimed, joying in another doubt de- </p><p>stroyed. “If it was poetry now, or ro- </p><p>mance—something delicate and beautiful— </p><p>I could. Do you know that yesterday, </p><p>when I met you, and learned that you were </p><p>so traveled, I was really afraid of you at </p><p>first. Then I tried to think of something </p><p>touching Guatemala to talk with you about, </p><p>and I couldn’t. I had been to Champerico </p><p>once—a yachting cruise—and all I could </p><p>remember of it was the smells! Wasn’t it </p><p>from Champerico you arrived here on Mon- </p><p>day?” </p><p> “Yes,” she said.</p><p> He thrilled with the certainty of this last</p><p>doubt dispelled. His triumph was com- </p><p>plete. </p><p> “And now—now! You are going to stay</p><p>with us,” he exulted. “We are going to </p><p>make it so attractive for you here in Cortina </p><p>that you will not want to leave. You must </p><p>know my people-” </p><p> In full tide she stopped him, lifting her</p><p>hand to his arm. </p><p> “You forget that trouble may come, that</p><p>there may be other things to think of than </p><p>pleasuring, my dear friend.” </p><p> “Trouble!” he echoed. “What trouble?”</p><p>“I spoke of it today, and you laughed at </p><p>me.” </p><p> “Oh, that!” Wisdom returned and</p><p>nudged him. “The rumors you have heard? </p><p>I can not weep over them, though I will try </p><p>if you bid me.” </p><p> She touched his arm again, with a cer-</p><p>tain annoyed impatience now. </p><p> “Be serious, please. Your uncle should</p><p>know. Is he not uneasy at these whisper- </p><p>ings? Something surely must have reached </p><p>him of them?” </p><p> “I guess he hears a lot of things. The</p><p>point is, you see, the revolutionary wolf has </p><p>barked so often that nobody pays attention </p><p>to it.” He laughed teasingly. “You’ve </p><p>got to parade your wolf up to the very door </p><p>to make us believe he’s going to come in.” </p><p>She did not laugh with him. She leaned </p><p>his way, speaking earnestly. </p><p> “I can’t stay longer, but before I go in</p><p>I want to tell you that I have learned other </p><p>things since I saw you today—information </p><p>that may be of value to the State. It is one </p><p>reason why I came down. I am convinced </p><p>132 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>that your Government is living in a sense </p><p>of false security. Either that, or it knows </p><p>more than you are aware of.” </p><p> He parried this.</p><p> “Learned things? How? From whom?</p><p>You are a stranger here.” </p><p> “It doesn’t matter how it came to me—</p><p>it came. That is sufficient.” </p><p> “Oh! May I hope to know what this</p><p>information is? I’m prickling with curios- </p><p>ity.” </p><p> His tone seemed to jar upon her.</p><p> “You still don’t take me seriously, Senor</p><p>Don Enrique Segovia. So why should I </p><p>tell you? I think—yes—I will write what </p><p>I have learned to your superintendent of </p><p>police. He would know how to prize my </p><p>information. I will do it!” </p><p> She was mocking at him, Segovia felt.</p><p> “But I would value it as much,” he</p><p>asserted. </p><p> “No. You would only laugh at me</p><p>again, and we should quarrel.” </p><p> She rose from the bench.</p><p> “Don’t go,” he implored. “I may have</p><p>laughed at your fears, but at you—it is an </p><p>impossibility!” </p><p> She shook her head.</p><p> “No. I must go. Positively. Senor</p><p>Morales will be calling to me. And I’m </p><p>displeased with you. I’m a woman, and </p><p>you don’t talk politics with women. Isn’t </p><p>it so? You think I wouldn’t understand. </p><p>Still, 1 will tell you something. Listen!” </p><p>She swayed alluringly toward him. Her </p><p>Ups touched his ear. “You are, after all, </p><p>a dear boy, and I’m glad to have you for a </p><p>friend.” </p><p> She ran away from him into the house.</p><p> Segovia walked home on air. All that</p><p>Mary had said squared with his belief in </p><p>her. He would let Jimmy know how he had </p><p>traduced her. As for Smith, he was a plain </p><p>blind fool! </p><p>I I JIMMY sat up late that night read- </p><p>Ej33?y ing a novel he had begun on the </p><p>^ boat, and had forgotten in the rush </p><p>of events he was plumped into. It was one </p><p>o’clock when he laid the book down, and </p><p>sought his bed. Sleep did not come to him. </p><p>He was thinking of the meeting with the </p><p>President of Zanhoria, of Kaufman’s re- </p><p>turn, of his appointment with Ortega </p><p>in the morning, of all the happenings of </p><p>the day. </p><p> It might have been half an hour later</p><p>when he heard through his transom a faint </p><p>squeak. It was the door across the hall. </p><p>Was Mrs. Isaacs coming out or going in? </p><p>And in either case why was a solitary </p><p>woman prowling about at this hour of the </p><p>night? </p><p> Jimmy’s curiosity, whetted by the half-</p><p>formed suspicions he entertained, moved </p><p>him to an act of espionage which under </p><p>other circumstances he would have scorned. </p><p>He got up and opened his door cautiously </p><p>to a crack. He widened it gently and </p><p>peered out into the dim twilight of the hall. </p><p>Mrs. Isaacs, in a long kimono, was in the </p><p>act of passing through the last door on her </p><p>side of the corridor. There was the flash </p><p>of an electric torch as she disappeared. </p><p> It was a rule with Jimmy to know his</p><p>whereabouts in a strange hotel in the event </p><p>of a fire, and he knew that the door Mrs. </p><p>Isaacs had vanished through gave upon </p><p>a flight of stairs to the roof. He drew </p><p>back into his room, mystified and a little </p><p>frightened. </p><p> “Great Heaven!” he ejaculated. “Are we</p><p>going to have a suicide? Is she going to </p><p>jump off into the street?” </p><p> He thought of giving an alarm, and</p><p>thought tetter of it. If the woman wanted </p><p>to kill herself there were a dozen less ter- </p><p>rible ways than that. Perhaps she was </p><p>going up for the air; perhaps she wanted </p><p>a view of the city by night; perhaps .... </p><p> “Oh, blast it,” he scolded himself, “a</p><p>woman is apt to do any fool thing that </p><p>comes into her head. If she wanted to die </p><p>there was the whole Caribbean Sea she </p><p>crossed. Lots of water, and no fuss or </p><p>muss.” </p><p> He went back to bed. How long he lay</p><p>staring up at the shadowy ceiling he could </p><p>not have told, but after a time two strokes </p><p>of the great bell in the Church of Our Lady </p><p>of Charity pealed on the night. The echo </p><p>had scarcely died away when the slightest </p><p>of sounds came to Jimmy from the end of the </p><p>hall. A moment or two later the door op- </p><p>posite squeaked. Mrs. Isaacs had returned </p><p>to her room. </p><p> “Keeping me awake like this!” Jimmy</p><p>grumbled. “What the devil was she doing </p><p>up there all this time, I’d like to know? </p><p>Looking for that lost relative perhaps. </p><p>Huh!” </p><p> He turned on his side, and with the ques-</p><p>tion still begging an answer grumbled him- </p><p>bled himself off to sleep. </p><p>For the Flag </p><p>133 </p><p>CHAPTER XIV </p><p> WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE</p><p>IN THE morning before going down to </p><p>breakfast jimmy climbed the stairs to </p><p>the roof. It was sheer inquisitiveness that </p><p>impelled him. He hoped to find some evi- </p><p>dence of Mrs. Isaacs’ visit to the spot. </p><p> He looked about him. With the excep-</p><p>tion of odds and ends of old newspapers </p><p>the street tourbillions had sent wheeling up </p><p>through many weeks there was nothing on </p><p>the roof to excite comment. He walked to </p><p>the north parapet and looked over. The </p><p>Plaza Central was spread out before him. </p><p>Beyond, in the distance, were the Govern- </p><p>ment buildings and the president’s man- </p><p>sion. Between these and the business sec- </p><p>tion of the city was a checkered map of </p><p>many-tinted dwellings. </p><p> Jimmy’s gaze returned to the square at</p><p>his feet. An automobile was stopping be- </p><p>fore the Banco Nacional. He recognized </p><p>Morales alighting from it. And that was </p><p>Miss Taylor with him; Jimmy could not </p><p>mistake that erect, elegant figure. </p><p> “A busy day for you Senor Renegado,”</p><p>he muttered. “I wonder how you will get </p><p>that dispatch to Kaufman? You can’t </p><p>telephone him for fear of somebody listen- </p><p>ing in. You can’t take it yourself, and </p><p>I don’t think you’d risk trusting it to the </p><p>mails—not now. A messenger, perhaps. </p><p>But not Miss Taylor; that wouldn't do at </p><p>all.” </p><p> The car drove off. It drew up at the</p><p>post-office on the east side of the square, </p><p>and Miss Taylor got out and went in. </p><p>Jimmy grinned derisively. </p><p> “Sending a story home to her magazine,</p><p>maybe. Interview with the secretary of </p><p>state. Great stuff!” </p><p> He was turning away when in. the direc-</p><p>tion of the Calle Comercio he saw a thing </p><p>that arrested him. It was the Imperial </p><p>German standard fluttering up to the peak </p><p>of its tall staff. He could see the man at </p><p>the halyards. La Caridad was striking the</p><p>hour. </p><p> “Nine o’clock. They are on the job early</p><p>there,” Jimmy soliloquized. “We don’t </p><p>take down our shutters, Billy said, until </p><p>ten. They are always on the job, these </p><p>Germans.” </p><p> The little frowning knot popped out be-</p><p>tween his eyes as he stood surveying the </p><p>flag. His thoughts returned to Mrs. Isaacs. </p><p> “I wonder if that had anything to do with</p><p>her trip up here? 1 wonder if she sig- </p><p>naled-” </p><p> 1-Ie broke off with a curt laugh at him-</p><p>self. It was black night when Mrs. Isaacs </p><p>made her visit to the roof. </p><p> Jimmy suddenly crouched down behind</p><p>the parapet. His eyes had lighted on a. </p><p>small figure in gray crossing the plaza from </p><p>the east. It was Mrs. Isaacs. He watched </p><p>her from his hiding-place. She was at the </p><p>bandstand now. Here she stopped, lin- </p><p>gered a moment, and went on, but with a </p><p>sharp turn to the north. It would bring </p><p>her out at a point directly in face of the </p><p>Banco Nacional. </p><p> “Hello!” Jimmy exclaimed. “She is going</p><p>there.” </p><p> Even as he voiced his surprise Mrs.</p><p>Isaacs crossed the street and entered the </p><p>bank. Jimmy again mocked at himself. </p><p> “What of it? What did I go there for?</p><p>What do hundreds, thousands of people go </p><p>there for? Bah! I’m making mountains </p><p>of molehills. To the deuce with Mrs. </p><p>Isaacs! I’m going to get some breakfast.” </p><p> On the point of leaving he cast another</p><p>glance at the post-office. The Morales car </p><p>was gone. He swept the four sides of the </p><p>square for a sight of it. but in vain. Where- </p><p>upon he retraced his steps to the hatch. </p><p>Before going in he looked off to the south </p><p>where the piled-up mountains drew a </p><p>blurred blue wave-line across the sky. </p><p> That highest peak must be Borazo, the</p><p>sleeping volcano, from the top of which </p><p>Winifred Brewer had said the Pacific could </p><p>be seen. He could vision the girl as she</p><p>had stood beside him in the bungalow out- </p><p>side the old stone house. It was a picture </p><p>he had summoned up more than once in the </p><p>past twenty-four hours, and each time from </p><p>a new angle of discovered charm. </p><p> He went down the stairs, and to his de-</p><p>layed breakfast. Subsequently he loitered </p><p>about the lobby impatient for Enrique to </p><p>arrive and tell him that the guns were </p><p>ready. He would start for the hacienda </p><p>immediately after keeping his appointment </p><p>with Ortega at eleven. It was past ten now. </p><p> A young man came in from the street, and</p><p>spoke to the clerk. Jimmy, happening to </p><p>look that way, saw the amiable Mr. Gomez </p><p>pointing him out. The young man came </p><p>over to where he was standing, bowed low, </p><p>and tendered him an envelope monogramed </p><p>in gold. </p><p>134 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Tengo el honor de presentarle urn carta</p><p>del Senor Don Manuel Morales ” he said, </p><p>and bowed himself away. </p><p> Jimmy thought of calling him back, but</p><p>reflected that were an answer desired the </p><p>messenger would have waited. He found </p><p>a chair, sat down, took out his penknife, </p><p>and slit open the envelope. Whatever </p><p>Senor Morales’ proficiency in oral English, </p><p>he evidently was not sure of himself with </p><p>the written word. The note was in Span- </p><p>ish. Jimmy made rather heavy weather </p><p>of it, but finally mastered the contents. </p><p>Stripped of a maze of flowery superlatives </p><p>and reduced to bald terms, he was informed </p><p>that Senora Morales was seriously ill, and </p><p>the dinner invitation was recalled. </p><p> “That dispatch, of course,” he specu-</p><p>lated. “This is what Ortega expected.” </p><p>His mouth widened humorously. “I’ve got </p><p>to eat four bananas, and I hate the sight </p><p>of the darned things.” </p><p> He sat on, hoping for Segovia’s appear-</p><p>ance. Was there any hitch about the guns? </p><p>No, there couldn’t be; he had the Govern- </p><p>ment’s secret sanction at his back. What </p><p>the dickens could be keeping him, then? </p><p> At ten minutes of eleven Jimmy aban-</p><p>doned hope of Segovia’s coming. He went </p><p>to the desk and asked for a sheet of paper. </p><p> “You will find me with E. O. after</p><p>eleven,” he wrote. </p><p> He sealed the note, and charged the clerk</p><p>to give it into Segovia’s hands if he looked </p><p>in. Then he set out to keep his engagement </p><p>with Ortega. </p><p>HE TURNED south from the plaza </p><p>into the Calle Central, walked two </p><p>squares, and came to a long, ram- </p><p>bling structure pierced with an archway </p><p>that led into a great paved quadrangle. At </p><p>the farther end yawned the mouth of the </p><p>municipal prison. Around the quadrangle </p><p>doors opened into various administrative </p><p>departments—the lower courts of law, </p><p>mayor’s office, city police, and what not. </p><p>Also here was to be found the office of the </p><p>State superintendent of police. The posi-</p><p>tion was, in effect, a cabinet one, though it </p><p>was not so dignified in the Zanhorian con- </p><p>stitution. </p><p> Jimmy passed in under the arch. He</p><p>knew his way thus far, for it was here he had </p><p>come on Monday night with Enrique. A </p><p>man whom he accosted conducted him to a </p><p>door to the left and into a waiting-room. </p><p>Here his name was taken in to an adjoining </p><p>room, and almost instantly thereafter he </p><p>was ushered into this sancum. The super- </p><p>intendent was standing at his desk to greet </p><p>him. They shook hands. </p><p> “I should have told you,” Ortega said,</p><p>“of my private entrance from the street— </p><p>that.” He indicated a door at his back. </p><p>“It would have relieved you of this trouble.” </p><p>“I’m afraid I’ve kept you waiting,” </p><p>Jimmy apologized. “I was hoping to see </p><p>Enrique Segovia, and hung on till the last </p><p>minute. Those guns, you know.” </p><p> Ortega placed a chair for him, and re-</p><p>sumed his seat. </p><p> “Did not Senor Segovia mention it to</p><p>you?” he asked. “I arranged with him </p><p>about it last night at supper. The guns </p><p>went out early this morning in a cart— </p><p>four Mausers and as many Colts. My man </p><p>was instructed to say that they were from </p><p>you.” </p><p> “Oh,” said Jimmy.</p><p> He was disappointed.</p><p> Ortega gave him an exploring glance.</p><p>Jimmy felt his face grow red under it. </p><p> “I expected to take them myself,” he</p><p>murmured. “It’s all right, of course.” He </p><p>summoned a laugh and remarked: “I reckon </p><p>you’d better send out for some bananas. </p><p>I’m due to eat a few.” </p><p> “Yes?”</p><p> “Yes. If my head wasn’t stuffed with</p><p>wool I would have known that Morales </p><p>would have other things to do tonight than </p><p>to give a dinner-party.” </p><p> Ortega idly scanned the note Jimmy</p><p>passed to him, and laid it down. Since he</p><p>was acquainted with the essence of it the </p><p>manner did not concern him. </p><p> “I imagined you would hear from him,”</p><p>was his only comment. </p><p> “I say, Senor Superintendent,” exclaimed</p><p>Jimmy as a sudden thought visited him. </p><p>“What if those two held a meeting last </p><p>night? They can’t let the grass grow under </p><p>them now.” </p><p> The other shook his head.</p><p> “If Morales knew of Kaufman’s return,</p><p>and that is not certain, he would have had </p><p>difficulty in seeing him. His excellency </p><p>arrived three hours late. An accident. The </p><p>locomotive blew out a cylinder head after </p><p>leaving Yoro. Kaufman went directly to </p><p>his house in the Calle Rosario, and to bed, </p><p>I judge, for he did not come out. At Mora- </p><p>les’ house there was but one caller last </p><p>JttrS </p><p>l-n-rl </p><p>For the Flag </p><p>135 </p><p>night—our afflicted young friend, Don En- </p><p>rique Segovia.” </p><p> Jimmy bounced in his chair.</p><p> “The deuce! When he left me he said</p><p>he was going to bed.” </p><p> The superintendent was silent for an ap-</p><p>preciable time. He was leaning back gaz- </p><p>ing at a picture on the wall over the desk. </p><p>Jimmy wondered what was coming. At </p><p>last Ortega spoke. </p><p> “Sometimes, when a man receives a hard</p><p>blow—on his head, let us put it—he loses </p><p>his sense of perspective for a period. Then, </p><p>if he is fortunate, he gets another blow on </p><p>the same spot, and" is himself again. In </p><p>the interim he’s a trial to his friends.” </p><p> “I know who you have in mind,” said</p><p>Jimmy bluntly. “But I think I gave him </p><p>an eye-opener last night.” </p><p> He told of his talk with Enrique, of Billy</p><p>Smith’s positive identification of Mary Tay- </p><p>lor, and of his own conclusions regarding </p><p>her. </p><p> “And it seems,” appended Ortega quietly,</p><p>“that Don Enrique could not sleep until he </p><p>had seen the lady, and assured himself of </p><p>her unblemished innocence. Let us pray </p><p>that his frenzy did not whip his tongue to </p><p>say things that we shall all regret.” </p><p> “Great grief!” cried Jimmy aghast. “He</p><p>wouldn’t do a thing like that!” </p><p> “He is in love,” commented the official</p><p>dryly. “I think we will look for another </p><p>driver for your car tonight.” </p><p> “I have him,” submitted Jimmy promptly.</p><p>“Billy Smith of the American legation; and </p><p>he speaks German.” </p><p> Ortega was interested.</p><p> “You can be sure of him?” he inquired.</p><p>“I’d trust that kid to Hades and back,” </p><p>declared Jimmy. “I’ll have him on hand </p><p>when you say. So it is to be tonight?” </p><p> He leaned forward eagerly.</p><p> “Yes. Morales’note was the one proof</p><p>I needed. Kaufman will meet with him at </p><p>his house tonight, at the usual hour, I </p><p>assume.” He smiled. “Our good friend </p><p>Juan Lopez has been of service there.” </p><p>“Lopez?” Jimmy was puzzled. </p><p> “I let him go home this morning,” con-</p><p>tinued Ortega, “and it happened that </p><p>shortly afterward there was trouble with </p><p>the lighting system in Senor Morales’ house. </p><p>Marica, Juan’s woman, discovered it. There </p><p>is a cellar in which the kitchen stores are </p><p>kept. It is dark. Marica found that the </p><p>lights would not burn. Investigation </p><p>proved that the entire house system was </p><p>affected. The power company sent a man </p><p>to make repairs; and we shall have installed </p><p>presently a detectaphone under the side- - </p><p>board in the dining-room-” </p><p> “With the other end in the cellar,” cut</p><p>in Jimmy, his eyes aglow. “I get you, </p><p>Don Emilio. But if they don’t use the </p><p>dining-room? What then?” </p><p> Ortega spread out his palms.</p><p> “It is a chance. But Lopez says they</p><p>have used it heretofore. He has seen a </p><p>thread of light under the windows on those </p><p>other nights. </p><p> “I suppose,” advanced Jimmy diffidently,</p><p>“there’s 110 danger of this fellow Lopez </p><p>giving you the double-cross?” </p><p> “Giving me the what?”</p><p> Don Emilio’s English, comprehensive</p><p>though it was, failed him here. </p><p> “Go back on you; turn traitor,” Jimmy</p><p>explained. </p><p> “He won’t,” said the other with cold</p><p>emphasis. “We have an understanding; </p><p>and he will answer for Marica.” </p><p>IT OCCURRED here to Jimmy </p><p>that it might be well to confide in </p><p>Don Emilio his suspicions of Mrs. </p><p>Rebecca Isaacs. He did so. The super- </p><p>intendent listened with tranquil composure.</p><p>He said, when Jimmy was through: </p><p> “If we are right about Miss Taylor it</p><p>would seem to preclude suspicion of this </p><p>Mrs. Isaacs. Two German intelligence </p><p>people—and both women—working in one </p><p>small city is hardly probable. I won’t say </p><p>it is impossible—the term is obsolete—but </p><p>it is uneconomic, a crime in German eyes. </p><p>The woman’s mission may very well be </p><p>exactly as she has stated it.” </p><p> “But the visit to the roof—at two in the</p><p>morning!” argued Jimmy unconvinced. </p><p>“That is what stops me.” </p><p> “If I had time I could evolve a dozen</p><p>reasons for it,” returned the other. His </p><p>gray eyes twinkled. “When you have lived </p><p>to my age you will know that the thing you </p><p>least expect a woman to do is precisely the </p><p>thing she is most likely to do. But we are </p><p>straying from our objective. I will ask </p><p>you and Mr. Smith to stay close to your </p><p>hotel after nine tonight. Keep to your </p><p>room; I shall know then exactly where to </p><p>find you. You will be sent for when the </p><p>time is at hand. My special reason for ask- </p><p>ing you to come to me this morning has </p><p>136 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>been satisfied—the word from Morales. </p><p>Have you a pistol?” </p><p> “I pack one in my grip,” answered</p><p>Jimmy. “I wish,” he added, “I could have </p><p>a look at Kaufman to size up his man- </p><p>power. Don’t you think it likely that he’ll </p><p>show himself today at the International? </p><p>Just to make people think there’s nothing </p><p>in the wind? I can get Mr. Lane to take </p><p>me there to lunch.” </p><p> Ortega nodded.</p><p> “I think it is likely, Mr. Perry, un-</p><p>less-” </p><p> “Oh, I say, Don Emilio! Just call me</p><p>Jimmy. I’ll be proud to have you. You're </p><p>a man’s man, sir. It’s good to know you.” </p><p> The superintendent acknowledged this</p><p>gravely. Under the surface he was im- </p><p>mensely pleased, for he liked this young </p><p>American. </p><p> “To me the honor, Jimmy. Yes, unless</p><p>he has a better reason, I think it is likely </p><p>that Herr Kaufman will show himself at </p><p>the club today.” </p><p> “His last appearance,” grinned Jimmy.</p><p> A little scraping sound caused him to</p><p>look toward the outer door. He noticed </p><p>that there was a steel box attached to it. </p><p> “The post,” said Ortega. He got up,</p><p>fitted a key to the box, and took out a letter. </p><p>He returned to his desk, and studied the </p><p>superscription a moment. With an ex- </p><p>cusatory gesture he opened the missive. </p><p>The news it conveyed was sensational but </p><p>his face gave no indication of it. He looked </p><p>up at Jimmy. </p><p> “I will read you this,” he said. “It was</p><p>mailed this morning, by the postmark. </p><p>Spanish, and unsigned. Hand disguised, </p><p>I should say.” </p><p> He translated the note:</p><p> There is a secrct wireless plant at the German</p><p>legation. Watch the flagstaff after midnight.</p><p> “Mrs. Isaacs!” popped out Jimmy.</p><p> But immediately his countenance fell.</p><p>The warning did not fit in with his theory </p><p>of the woman; for in spite of Ortega he </p><p>believed she was a German spy. </p><p> The superintendent stroked his chin</p><p>softly. He was deeply interested in this </p><p>intelligence he had received. It was only </p><p>since Juan Lopez’s revelation that he had </p><p>seriously connected Kaufman with the plot </p><p>against the State. He had not, in the in- </p><p>terim, turned his thoughts to the German le- </p><p>gation; they were with Kaufman at Arraca. </p><p> “Ah,” he murmured, “I am beginning to</p><p> understand. They have a wireless at the</p><p> lumber camp. And the yacht mentioned</p><p> in the Washington dispatch has one—of</p><p> course.”</p><p> “If it was not Mrs. Isaacs who, do you</p><p> think, sent the note?” Jimmy asked. “Some</p><p> resident of Cortina who has stumbled on</p><p> the secret?”</p><p> “I am not thinking of the sender, my</p><p> good friend,” replied Ortega. “It is the</p><p> verification of this advice that I am con-</p><p> cerned with. Afterward-”</p><p> Some one tapped on the street door.</p><p> Ortega quit the desk, and consulted a win-</p><p> dow mirror artfully placed to reflect through</p><p> the jalousie any one who stood without.</p><p> “It is Enrique Segovia,” he announced.</p><p> “I left a line for him saying he could find</p><p> me here,” Jimmy told him.</p><p> Ortega shrugged resignedly.</p><p> “In that case-”</p><p> He did not finish, but opened the door.</p><p> Segovia strode in. His face was flushed,</p><p> and his eyes were clouded with an expres-</p><p> sion that was anger, irritation, despair and</p><p> sullen defiance welded into a gloomy whole.</p><p>CHAPTER XV </p><p>MAKING READY </p><p> SEGOVIA exploded into rapid-fire Span-</p><p> ish the moment the door was closed;</p><p> it was a natural reversion to his native</p><p> tongue in an hour of stress. But he caught</p><p> sight of Jimmy’s bewildered face, and</p><p> changed to English.</p><p> “I am just from my uncle,” he said</p><p> savagely. “Wejiave had words—a quar-</p><p> rel. He will not believe. But stay! I</p><p> must tell you what went before.”</p><p> He did not go on right away, but walked</p><p> nervously about the room, ignoring the</p><p> seat Ortega indicated to him. The super-</p><p> intendent said nothing, and waited. Sego-</p><p> via suddenly stopped in front of Jimmy’s</p><p> chair.</p><p> “You have told Don Emilio of our talk</p><p> last night?” he taxed.</p><p> “Briefly, yes,” Jimmy answered steadily.</p><p> “I thought that he should know.”</p><p> He expected an outbreak of reproaches.</p><p> To his surprise Segovia received the avowal</p><p> with an appearance of relief.</p><p> “That makes it easier,” he said, and went</p><p> on without pause. “I did not go home</p><p>For the Flag </p><p>137 </p><p>when I left you. Instead I called on Miss </p><p>Taylor, and—” his voice rose to a pitch of </p><p>triumph—“and I learned from her lips </p><p>that all these imputations that have been </p><p>brought against her are absolutely without </p><p>foundation.” </p><p> Jimmy stared at him, unbelieving of his</p><p>own ears. The fellow had indeed gone </p><p>stark mad. Ortega made no sound. </p><p> “I did not see my uncle at breakfast,”</p><p>Segovia proceeded. “I overslept. But I </p><p>went to his office. He acknowledged to </p><p>me that he did not count the copies of </p><p>that dispatch when they were laid on his </p><p>desk—he did not have the opportunity. </p><p>But the secretary claims that he made </p><p>three copies. He swears that he did. And </p><p>on this one man’s word alone rests the </p><p>charge against a woman’s honor. I say </p><p>that he is grossly in error or that he lies! </p><p>He may be getting German money. How </p><p>do you know that he isn’t?” </p><p> Jimmy threw a startled look in the super-</p><p>intendent’s direction. Here was a possi- </p><p>bility they had not reckoned with. The </p><p>man at the desk held his imperturbable </p><p>pose. He knew Valera’s secretary. Jimmy </p><p>turned to Segovia. He was continuing his </p><p>story, the angry blood boiling in his face. </p><p> “I submitted to Don Luis the facts I had</p><p>learned. He met them with total in- </p><p>credulity, with insulting doubts of my </p><p>sanity, with aspersions on Miss Taylor’s </p><p>character that were monstrous after what </p><p>she had told me. He-” </p><p> Jimmy caught him up with a burst of</p><p>exasperation in which alarm for their cause </p><p>was mingled. </p><p> “In God’s name, man, what did she tell</p><p>you?” he shouted. </p><p> “What?” shouted back Segovia. “That</p><p>she wanted to call on Senor Valera again, </p><p>at once, if possible, to talk with him about </p><p>her work. Would that be the desire of </p><p>a thief? Oh, I can see what you two are </p><p>thinking—that I played the fool—that I </p><p>brought up these charges, one by one, </p><p>and asked her to explain. Well, I did noth-</p><p>ing of the sort. I did not give her the </p><p>fraction of a hint that she was suspected. </p><p>We talked of many things, and my ques- </p><p>tions were slipped in here and there— </p><p>naturally—as well as Don Emilio could </p><p>have done it. I wanted the truth—do you </p><p>understand? I had to have it, for if she </p><p>had been deceiving me all along, I-” </p><p> His utterance choked and ceased. All</p><p>the latent turbulency of the man’s nature </p><p>was revealed in this one flashing instant. </p><p>Jimmy sought to restore him to himself. </p><p> “Go on,” he said, in a cool, even voice.</p><p>“How about that magazine—the name </p><p>of it?” </p><p> “Ah!” Segovia exhaled noisily. “It is</p><p>the North American Gazelle, published in </p><p>Philadelphia. An old-established periodical </p><p>of the highest order.” He laughed bitterly. </p><p>“My uncle desires to see her credentials— </p><p>a lady’s word is not sufficient. I shall be </p><p>asked next to make her prove that she </p><p>arrived here on Monday from Champerico.” </p><p>“She told you that—that she came from </p><p>Champerico?” </p><p> “She did!”</p><p> “Go on,” said Jimmy sententiously.</p><p>“What else is there to say?” retorted </p><p>Segovia. “I have proved my points. </p><p>Smith was mistaken—all of you mistaken. </p><p>You have traduced a perfectly irreproach- </p><p>able girl, defenseless except for me.” </p><p>Neither Jimmy nor Ortega spoke. </p><p>Segovia had resumed his caged pacing of </p><p>the room. </p><p> “There is another thing,” he broke out.</p><p>“Miss Taylor has heard these revolution </p><p>rumors that are afloat. She mentioned it </p><p>yesterday while we were out driving.” </p><p> “Oh, Lord!” groaned Jimmy.</p><p> “I made light of'them—denied them,”</p><p>Segovia shot out fiercely. “Do you think </p><p>I am a fool! She knows nothing of this </p><p>Kaufman business. She knows only what </p><p>everybody knows. You may form a dif- </p><p>ferent opinion of Miss Taylor after this </p><p>dinner tonight-” </p><p> “The invitation is withdrawn,” put in</p><p>Jimmy. “Read this. You will find its </p><p>counterpart, no doubt, waiting for you at </p><p>your house.” </p><p> Segovia read Morales’ note. Chagrin</p><p>was written on his face. </p><p> “The Dona Natalia was ill when I was</p><p>there last night,” he muttered. </p><p> “In preparation for this of today,” ob-</p><p>served Jimmy ironically. “Miss Taylor </p><p>never expected to see you tonight. Kauf- </p><p>man will be there.” </p><p> Segovia swore a wicked Spanish oath.</p><p>“Enough!” he cried. “I will hear no </p><p>more against her. Ha!” </p><p> He thought he saw his way to over-</p><p>whelming them with the convincing proof </p><p>of their blind stupidity. He came over to </p><p>where Ortega sat. </p><p>138 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Miss Taylor told me last night that</p><p>information had reached her of value to the </p><p>State. She refused to tell me what it was, </p><p>but said she would communicate it to the </p><p>superintendent of police. If she does this, </p><p>Don Emilio, what shall you have to say </p><p>then? Shall you,” he sneered, “regard it as </p><p>an enemy act?” </p><p> “By George, sir,” gasped Jimmy at</p><p>Ortega. “That note you just got! I saw </p><p>her go into the post-office-” </p><p> He checked himself at a slight movement</p><p>from the superintendent, but too late. </p><p>Segovia pounced upon his words. </p><p> “Ah! You have heard from her, Senor</p><p>Ortega! Now will you believe?” </p><p> Ortega turned to Jimmy.</p><p> “When?” he asked.</p><p> “While I was on the roof. It was striking</p><p>nine.” </p><p>ORTEGA examined again the post- </p><p>mark of the envelope on his desk. </p><p>The hour was 9:30 a.m. As he </p><p>knew, this was the time they began to make </p><p>up the mail for the second city delivery. </p><p> “Well, am I not to see what Miss Taylor</p><p>wrote?” demanded Segovia. “If others </p><p>have seen it I presume I may.” </p><p> Don Emilio, quietly handed him the</p><p>note. </p><p> “Why, it is not signed!” he exclaimed.</p><p>“As you see, Don Enrique. Yet per- </p><p>haps you are acquainted with the lady’s </p><p>writing. Yes?” </p><p> “No,” confessed Segovia, “I am not</p><p>acquainted with it.” </p><p> “Then there is no certainty that it is from</p><p>.Miss Taylor, this information.” </p><p> “But she said it was of value to the State.</p><p>And this is! One can hardly call it a coin- </p><p>cidence,” argued Segovia. “I shall find</p><p>out. I shall ask her.” </p><p> Ortega put his hand out and touched the</p><p>fiery young fellow’s arm. There was some- </p><p>thing placating, something paternal in the </p><p>gesture. </p><p> “Tomorrow, my boy,” he said. “We</p><p>will call judgment suspended until then. </p><p>I am willing to make all amends if I have </p><p>suspected the lady unjustly; but today— </p><p>tonight—I have work laid out for you, </p><p>Enrique. I have selected you to put this </p><p>radio plant out of business. Kaufman’s </p><p>people must not send that dispatch abroad </p><p>tonight.” </p><p> Jimmy admired the simple ease with</p><p>which the police head was disposing of a </p><p>difficulty. </p><p> “But—if you are right—if Kaufman</p><p>does go to Morales’—I am to drive the car </p><p>for Jimmy,” protested Segovia. </p><p> “I have arranged for that,” Ortega told</p><p>him. “This that I have for you to do is </p><p>vastly more important. It requires proved </p><p>courage. You are the man for it. My </p><p>choice.” </p><p> Segovia was almost normal again, and he</p><p>was flattered by the superintendent’s esti- </p><p>mate of him. </p><p> “What am I to do?” he asked.</p><p> “ ‘Watch the flagstaff,’ ” Ortega quoted</p><p>from the note. “That can mean but one </p><p>thing: they raise a wireless antenna on </p><p>it some time after midnight. The sending </p><p>apparatus is in the cellar, of course, and </p><p>you can’t get at it; but you can disable the </p><p>antenna. You will be stationed on the </p><p>adjacent roof. Some one, it is natural to </p><p>imagine, will be on guard on the legation </p><p>rOof. You are to overpower that man, and </p><p>cut the wire.” </p><p> Segovia’s eyes had kindled as he listened.</p><p>Mary Taylor receded into the background </p><p>of has thoughts, and a healthy reaction </p><p>followed; it was the stimulus of adventure </p><p>flowing in his veins. He spoke with </p><p>alacrity. </p><p> “I’ll do better than that. I’ll cut down</p><p>the flagpole.” He laughed now. “They </p><p>may complain to the police tomorrow, Don </p><p>Emilio. It’s an invasion of extra-territorial </p><p>rights.” </p><p> “They can not complain. They are</p><p>operating a secret wireless in contravention </p><p>of the public law,” returned the superin- </p><p>tendent. “Y011 will report to me here, please, </p><p>at half-past ten tonight for instructions.” </p><p> Jimmy felt that the interview, so far as</p><p>he was concerned, was at an end. It was </p><p>nearly twelve, and he remembered that the </p><p>negro Sam, Brewer’s chauffeur, would be </p><p>at the post-office at twelve. He would send </p><p>a word to Winifred by Sam. </p><p> “I think I will be going, Don Emilio,”</p><p>he said. “I have taken up enough of your </p><p>time.” </p><p> “And I; I will be going too, unless you</p><p>have something more to say to me,” </p><p>Segovia added. </p><p> Ortega rose.</p><p> “Nothing more this morning. Just keep</p><p>alive until tonight,” he smiled. “Go out </p><p>the way you came, Jimmy, if you please. </p><p>For the Flag </p><p>139 </p><p>It will excite less remark than if you both </p><p>leave by the same door, should any one be </p><p>passing.” </p><p> As jimmy, a few minutes later, issued</p><p>from the archway into the Calle Central </p><p>he looked about for Enrique. He glimpsed </p><p>him going down the street away from the </p><p>plaza. Jimmy drew a breath of relief. </p><p>He had felt, there in Ortega’s office, a sense </p><p>of constraint with Enrique, and that the </p><p>feeling was mutual Enrique’s present action </p><p>evinced. He had not waited for him. </p><p>Jimmy was sorry that this cloud had arisen </p><p>between them, for he liked the young </p><p>Zanhorian whole-heartedly. </p><p> “Oh, well, it won’t last,” he reflected.</p><p>“When Enrique gets over this Mary Taylor </p><p>fever he’ll be worth while again.” His </p><p>brow wrinkled as another view of the situ- </p><p>ation obtruded itself. “Suppose, after all, </p><p>he should be right about her—where would </p><p>I get off? At the wrong stop, by Jove! </p><p>Confound women anyway!” </p><p> With this sage conclusion he hurried on</p><p>to send a message to Winifred. It had been </p><p>his intention to drop into the hotel and </p><p>scribble a few lines advising her that the </p><p>attempt was for this night, but he aban- </p><p>doned it. The noon hour was booming out, </p><p>and he was afraid that Sam might not wait </p><p>the prescribed fifteen minutes. </p><p> He came to the square and cut across it</p><p>to the post-office. Sam was already on </p><p>hand, and Jimmy noted with approval </p><p>that he had placed his car some little way </p><p>down from the office, before a house-renting </p><p>agency, he gathered from the sign in the </p><p>window. Jimmy felt that he would not be </p><p>quite such a conspicuous target for the </p><p>curious eyes of those going in and out of </p><p>the public building when he spoke to Sam. </p><p>It would be but a word, for he knew from </p><p>much experience with negroes their inability </p><p>to “carry straight” a verbal message. </p><p> Jimmy lounged indifferently up to the car.</p><p>He saw that the tonneau was piled with </p><p>packages and boxes, things to eat, he sur- </p><p>mised. The delivery of the guns had, </p><p>perhaps, prompted Brewer to lay in stores </p><p>against possible eventualities. Within</p><p>touch of Sam’s elbow Jimmy stopped, and </p><p>maneuvered to light a cigaret. He spoke </p><p>to the man under his breath. </p><p> “Sam, I am Mr. James Perry. Sit still!”</p><p> “Yessuh.”</p><p> The black remained quiescent as a block</p><p>of ebony. Jimmy continued. </p><p> “Say to Miss Winifred this: ‘Lookforme</p><p>late tonight.’ ” </p><p> “ ‘Look for me late tonight,’ ” repeated</p><p>Sam. </p><p> “Good! You have earned five dollars,”</p><p>Jimmy said, and walked on drawing 011 his </p><p>cigaret. </p><p> Something—the nudging of a sixth sense,</p><p>it might have been—impelled him to glance </p><p>behind him. Sam was starting off. Stand- </p><p>ing in the door of the renting-agency was </p><p>Mrs. Isaacs. The machine moved away, </p><p>and she came on. Jimmy hastily turned to </p><p>front again. </p><p> “Where did she spring from?” he asked</p><p>himself irritably. “It will be getting so </p><p>pretty soon that I’ll be seeing her in my </p><p>sleep. I wonder if she caught on to it that </p><p>I	was talking with Sam? I wonder—great</p><p>guns!—if she was taking in the number </p><p>of the car?” He laughed shortly. “Oh, </p><p>bosh! I’m a regular old maid. I’ll be look- </p><p>ing under the bed for burglars next.” </p><p> Nevertheless, he did not go directly up</p><p>the Calle Commercio to his legation, as he </p><p>had intended, but stopped in at a tobacco </p><p>shop on the corner. Here he spent ten </p><p>minutes selecting a box of cigars. It helped </p><p>him to dodge Mrs. Isaacs, and besides he </p><p>would want something to smoke at the </p><p>hacienda. </p><p>JIMMY received a distinct shock </p><p>as he approached the legation. </p><p>Morales’ car stood in front of it, and </p><p>the Hon. John Henry Lane, bareheaded, </p><p>was escorting out to it no other than Miss </p><p>Mary Taylor. Jimmy was still some dis- </p><p>tance down the street, and he slipped into a </p><p>doorway to recover from this midriff thrust</p><p>at his suspicions of the girl. </p><p> “I’ll be shot if this don’t get my goat!”</p><p>he inelegantly remarked. </p><p> He heard presently the grunt of the</p><p>mechanism as the clutch was let in, and </p><p>he recollected that the car was pointed his </p><p>way. As he was not of a mind to be de- </p><p>tected skulking in a doorway he stepped </p><p>forth, and proceeded leisurely up the street. </p><p> Miss Taylor’s quick eye singled him out.</p><p>She spoke to her driver and the car slid up </p><p>to the walk precisely at the point that </p><p>would intercept Jimmy. </p><p> “How do you do, Mr. Perry?” she called</p><p>out to him. </p><p> He paused, apparently surprised and de-</p><p>lighted. </p><p>140 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> "Why, how do you do?” he returned.</p><p>“I’m beginning to believe that I wa\ bom </p><p>to good luck. This is the second time I </p><p>have had the happiness of seeing you </p><p>today.” </p><p> She widened her wonderful eyes at him.</p><p> “Indeed! And the first time?”</p><p> “You were going into the post-office.”</p><p>“And you wouldn’t stop and speak?” </p><p>“Oh, I was too far oil. And I was late </p><p>for my breakfast.” </p><p> “That,” she said with a radiant smile,</p><p>“is the cleverest excuse you could offer. </p><p>11	is so entirely satisfying. If I had robbed</p><p>you of your breakfast what would you have </p><p>thought when you learned that I was also </p><p>to deny you your dinner—or that Senor </p><p>Morales was? Viene &amp; ser lo mismo. You </p><p>have his apologies—yes? Poor Dona Na- </p><p>talia! She is really wretchedly indisposed.” </p><p>“Please convey to her my sympathy, and </p><p>to Senor Morales,” Jimmy entreated with </p><p>becoming concern. “For myself I have </p><p>lost beyond recall a pleasure that Senor </p><p>Morales kindly intimated was simply de- </p><p>ferred. I am leaving Cortina very shortly.” </p><p>Her face expressed polite regret. </p><p> “You are going away for good?”</p><p> “Or ill—one never knows.”</p><p> “You mean that you are going home to</p><p>fight the Germans, I suppose.” </p><p>“Eventually, if not now. Just at this </p><p>moment I am on my way to a luncheon </p><p>appointment with the American minister.” </p><p>He grinned. “At least I am reasonably </p><p>sure of that one meal. I have it here.” </p><p> He touched the package under his arm.</p><p> She laughed in real amusement.</p><p> “Mr. Lane!” she exclaimed. “I am just</p><p>from him. I came down on some errands </p><p>Dona Natalia forgot to mention to me this </p><p>morning. We chanced to pass through this </p><p>street, and I saw the flag—Old Glory!” </p><p>She clasped her hands as might a saint at </p><p>prayer. “I just had to go in and register. </p><p>And Mr. Lane! Such a charming man.</p><p>So—so—” her eyes were ecstatic—“beauti- </p><p>fully impressed with the responsibilities of </p><p>his eminent post. I adore him!” </p><p> Hang it, she’s making fun of him, thought</p><p>Jimmy. I’ll risk a shot at her. He said: </p><p>“You found the key to his weak spot, </p><p>I perceive; yet really Lane isn’t such an </p><p>ass as he seems—he can see through a mill- </p><p>stone with a hole in it as well as the next </p><p>one, especially if there’s a pretty woman </p><p>at the far end. But I’m keeping you.” </p><p>He held out his hand. “Enrique has told </p><p>me of his call on you last night.” He imag- </p><p>ined he felt her fingers flex slightly. “Poor </p><p>chap! You have bewitched him, and he </p><p>doesn’t know it. Or might it be proper to </p><p>say ‘lucky chap’ of one who is under a </p><p>spell?” He laughed good-naturedly, and </p><p>rattled on. “I won’t say good-by; it’s </p><p>bad medicine. I’ll say—how is it in </p><p>German—auf wiedersehn? Anyway, I </p><p>mean I shall exist only in the hope of seeing </p><p>you again.” </p><p> She bit her lip, for he had bowed and</p><p>moved away before she could frame an </p><p>adequate rejoinder. She bade the driver </p><p>go on, and leaned back with a delicate </p><p>frown penciled between her sea-blue eyes. </p><p> The car was turning into the Calle</p><p>Grande on the north side of the plaza when </p><p>the driver brought it to a stop at an earnest </p><p>signal from a little woman in gray who was </p><p>standing just around the corner. </p><p> “What is it, Gaspar?” inquired Miss</p><p>Taylor. </p><p> The driver’s answer was forestalled by the</p><p>appearance of the little woman at the door </p><p>of the machine. </p><p> “How do you do, Miss Taylor?” she</p><p>smiled. In a quick undertone she added </p><p>something that caused Miss Taylor to </p><p>accept the extended hand. To passers-by </p><p>here were two friends pleasantly met. </p><p>Gaspar at the wheel cocked his ear hoping </p><p>to hear what was said, but the voices were </p><p>pitched too low for him, and in a language </p><p>he did not understand. </p><p> The two talked in rapid, questioning</p><p>sentences for a brief period. Then fol- </p><p>lowed another exchange of handshakes,</p><p>and Mrs. Isaacs stepped down from the </p><p>running-board. At a word from Miss </p><p>Taylor the car continued on its way. Her </p><p>face was thoughtful. </p><p> Mrs. Isaacs crossed over to the renting-</p><p>agency below the post-office. In ten min- </p><p>utes she was out again on the street. She </p><p>waved back the man who had accompanied </p><p>her to the door. He expostulated, defer- </p><p>ence in all his manner, but her negation was </p><p>positive, and with a shrug and a bow he </p><p>returned inside. These Americans! One </p><p>knew not what to expect of them. They </p><p>would walk in the heat of the day to inspect </p><p>a residence when an automobile was at their </p><p>disposal. Madre de Dios! </p><p> Mrs. Isaacs walked sedately south on the</p><p>Calle Commercio until she came to the </p><p>For the Flag </p><p>141 </p><p>CaUe Dolores, a dozen blocks from the </p><p>piaza. She turned west on this, and began </p><p>to scrutinize the houses closely. They </p><p>were detached, each in its own plat of </p><p>ground. Finally she paused at No. 140, </p><p>drew a key from her pocket and let herself </p><p>in. It was the furnished house Walter </p><p>Brewer had so hurriedly departed from on </p><p>Tuesday moming. </p><p> It would appear that Mrs. Isaacs’ search</p><p>for her lost relative was taking on curious </p><p>angles of endeavor. </p><p>CHAPTER XVI </p><p>IN AID OF THE CAUSE </p><p>T&gt;ILLY SMITH looked up with a broad </p><p>grin when Jimmy entered the legation. </p><p>“Got news for you, sport,” he cried. </p><p> “No, you haven’t,” Jimmy countered.</p><p>“I’ve been speaking with her down the </p><p>street. Saw her coming out of here.” </p><p> “It’s my Panama pet,” declared Billy</p><p>emphatically. “If it isn’t it’s her twin </p><p>sister. Gee, his nibs fell for her hard. </p><p>Listen! You can hear the echo yet.” </p><p> “Shut up!” Jimmy barked at him.</p><p>“Bring out the visitors’ book. I want a </p><p>peek at it.” </p><p> “She’s in it all right,” Billy assured him.</p><p>“Miss Mary W. Taylor, Minneapolis, Min- </p><p>nesota. I guided her dear little hand. Oh, </p><p>boy! Ain’t she a dream! The kind they </p><p>rob the banks for.” </p><p> While he was chattering his nonsense</p><p>Billy had produced the register. Jimmy </p><p>studied the entry. </p><p> “Darn it all,” he mumbled, “I wish I had</p><p>that note. This looks something like it— </p><p>the ‘W’ in ‘Watch the flagstaff.’ But </p><p>Ortega said the writing was disguised. I’m </p><p>up a stump.” </p><p> He banged the book shut, impatiently.</p><p>“What’s the excitement?” inquired Billy, </p><p>who was scanning him expectantly. </p><p> “Got an American newspaper directory</p><p>in the archives of this mausoleum?” de- </p><p>manded Jimmy. </p><p> “An old one.”</p><p> “Get it out—not now, but while I’m in</p><p>with Lane—and see if there’s a magazine </p><p>published in Philadelphia called the North </p><p>American Gazette.” </p><p> “What the-”</p><p> “And say, sonny, you ought to be home</p><p>in bed. You’ve got a fever coming on. </p><p>Your eyes are not right. I’ll mention it to </p><p>Lane. A complete rest is what you need. </p><p>Three days; longer maybe.” </p><p> “Aha!” Billy’s nose twitched violently.</p><p>“You haven’t forgotten your promise. </p><p>You are going to let me hefp?” </p><p> Jimmy nodded.</p><p> “Tonight. Do you know the Fernandez</p><p>hacienda on the Santa Marta Road?” </p><p> “Like the way to dinner. Been by it a</p><p>million times.” </p><p> “All right. Get some sleep and come to</p><p>the hotel at nine sharp—my room. Wear a </p><p>cap. Do you own a pistol?” </p><p> “You bet. An automatic.”</p><p> Billy’s voice changed to a feeble moan,</p><p>and he dropped limply into a chair. He </p><p>had heard a hand on the door of the next </p><p>room. It was Mr. Whittaker, the secre- </p><p>tary, coming in. </p><p> “Smith,” he began morosely, but at sight</p><p>of Jimmy he broke into glad acclaim. “It’s </p><p>Mr. Perrv! How are you, sir? You have </p><p>called to see the minister? He will be </p><p>delighted.” He turned irritably on Billy. </p><p>“In Heaven’s name, Smith, what has over- </p><p>taken you? What are you making those </p><p>horrid sounds for?” </p><p> “He’s not well,” put in Jimmy. “I re-</p><p>marked it when I came in. A touch of </p><p>fever, I should say.” </p><p> Mr. Whittaker gazed through his spec-</p><p>tacles in acute astonishment at his assistant. </p><p>Not twenty minutes before, in the presence </p><p>of the departing Miss Taylor, he had been </p><p>as vivacious as a monkey. </p><p> “I’m feeling awful bad,” whimpered</p><p>Billy. “It struck me all of a sudden.” </p><p> “Go home and to bed, young fellow.</p><p>Call a doctor.” Jimmy gave Whittaker a </p><p>friendly tap on the shoulder. “You ought </p><p>to let him have a few days off. An ounce </p><p>of prevention—what?” </p><p> The pale-faced secretary tingled with</p><p>pleasure at the plutocratic touch. </p><p> “Certainly, Smith, certainly,” he</p><p>sparkled. “Stay till Monday. I’ll look </p><p>after your end. Don’t worry. Shall we go </p><p>in to the minister, Mr. Perry?” </p><p> Billy, cautiously recovering, stared at the</p><p>door that closed on them. </p><p> “Huh, talk about love making the world</p><p>go ’round,” he gibed. “It’s grease! The </p><p>kind Jimmy’s got in barrelfuls. I wish I </p><p>was good and plenty smeared with it.” </p><p> He left his chair, and hurriedly consulted</p><p>the newspaper directory. He did not want </p><p>142 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Whittaker to come back and question him. </p><p>He made a mental note of his finding, </p><p>grabbed for his hat, and scampered to the </p><p>door. He pulled up as he reached it. </p><p> “Gosh!” he exclaimed. “I forgot to</p><p>tell Jimmy that Mrs. Ikey was here this </p><p>morning, and slipped away without regis- </p><p>tering. He’ll get it first from the old man </p><p>now.” </p><p> He went out grumbling at himself for</p><p>overlooking this extra morsel of legation </p><p>news. </p><p> Jimmy found the portly envoy in excel-</p><p>lent spirits. Good humor played upon his </p><p>brow, and peeped from his eye. </p><p> “Ah, James, my dear boy, how are you</p><p>today?” he caroled. “I was rather expect- </p><p>ing you to drop in and talk over the pro- </p><p>cedure of last night. A little sooner, James, </p><p>and I could have given you a surprise.” </p><p> He rubbed his hands and wagged his</p><p>head with ponderous cunning. </p><p> “A surprise?” said Jimmy innocently.</p><p>“What, sir?” </p><p> “A lady, my boy. One in whom we are</p><p>all deeply interested.” </p><p> “Not Miss Taylor?”</p><p> “Herself, James. And, egad, sir, I can’t</p><p>bring myself to blame Senor Segovia for </p><p>his flair in that direction. A beautiful </p><p>woman! Captivating! As grateful to the </p><p>eye as a—ah—ahumph—young gazelle.” </p><p>“Great Scott! He certainly did fall for </p><p>her!” ejaculated Jimmy inwardly. Aloud </p><p>he said: “You have surprised me, sir. </p><p>This, I would have imagined, is the last </p><p>place Miss Taylor would have ventured in.” </p><p>“A remarkable woman, James. It was </p><p>a treat to visit with her,” gabbled Lane. </p><p>“It removed the last doubt I entertained </p><p>of her. Would a person who had stolen a </p><p>State secret come to the—er—ahumph— </p><p>nest, so to speak, in which it was hatched? </p><p>No, certainly not. Would the accredited </p><p>correspondent of the—what’s the maga- </p><p>zine?”</p><p> “Philadelphia North American Gazette,</p><p>she says.” </p><p> “Oh, yes, to be sure.” Lane scribbled</p><p>on a pad before him. “I know it. Would </p><p>the correspondent of that pre-eminent </p><p>periodical be guilty of—ah—latrociny, shall </p><p>we call it? Most assuredly not!” </p><p> Jimmy stared at him. First Enrique,</p><p>now Lane! Could it really be that he was in </p><p>the wrong? And Ortega—was he, too, as </p><p>badly misled? As he thought back on it </p><p>Ortega had seemed to waver in the last few </p><p>minutes of his talk with Enrique this </p><p>morning. </p><p> “Look here, Mr. Lane,” he blurted out,</p><p>“I'm beginning to think that dispatch </p><p>wasn’t stolen at all. There’s a mistake </p><p>somewhere. Enrique Segovia claims that </p><p>it lies with Senor Valera’s secretary. There </p><p>is no one else to lay it to, if we eliminate </p><p>Miss Taylor, unless, of course, it happened </p><p>that Senor Valera chewed the paper up and </p><p>swallowed it in a fit of absent-mindedness.” </p><p>He laughed, but without mirth. </p><p> Lane^&gt;vas silent. He was leaning back</p><p>and twiddling his thumbs, and smiling, so </p><p>it seemed to Jimmy, at his own senile </p><p>imaginings of his late fair visitor. </p><p> “I say, Mr. Lane,” he persevered,</p><p>“Morales has recalled his dinner invitation. </p><p>Senor Ortega says it means that Kaufman </p><p>is going there tonight, and it’s my chance </p><p>to get him. But if the dispatch was not </p><p>stolen what reason have we to believe that </p><p>there will be a meeting tonight instead of </p><p>Sunday? The situation is beyond me.” </p><p>Lane, still smiling, tapped his temple with </p><p>a long white finger, and spoke. His answer </p><p>was so astonisliingly at variance with the </p><p>question asked that Jimmy gaped at him. </p><p> “She has brains, sir, as well as beauty.</p><p>It is why she came—the act of unconscious </p><p>innocence walking on the edge of the mine </p><p>without fear of harm. No one but a beauti- </p><p>ful woman with brains would dare the thing </p><p>that might destroy her.” </p><p> Jimmy was sensible of the contradiction</p><p>of the minister’s words, and a variety of </p><p>expressions succeeded one another on his</p><p>face. But he said nothing. Lane was not </p><p>through, he saw. </p><p>“I ENJOYED it immensely, her </p><p>call,” Lane continued. “I am still </p><p>enjoying it. She approached me on </p><p>my blind side—oh, it was rarely done, as </p><p>sweetly as a child at play with its doll! </p><p>I am letting you see, James, as I have no </p><p>doubt you have already seen, that John </p><p>Henry Lane is a poor fool for vanity, and </p><p>delights in incense burned at his feet of </p><p>clay. It is only in a moment such as this </p><p>that I will confess my weakness—when </p><p>I have been properly made aware of it. </p><p>‘Oh why should the spirit of mortal be </p><p>proud,’ when teetoodledum, teetoodledow— </p><p>or however it goes. Perhaps you can sup- </p><p>ply it, James. But no matter; I did, </p><p>For the Flag </p><p>143 </p><p>Heaven help me, bathe in that lovely </p><p>creature’s homage—and she went away in </p><p>the moral certainty that I had not the </p><p>remotest suspicion of her object in coming.” </p><p>The Hon. John Henry sat up in his chair </p><p>and chuckled at the sport he had been </p><p>having with his young friend. Jimmy </p><p>heaved a huge sigh of restored confidence </p><p>in his own judgment. </p><p> “You had me going, sir. I didn’t know</p><p>where you were coming out,” he acknowl- </p><p>edged with a grin. “Then you do believe </p><p>that Miss Taylor stole the paper?” </p><p> “Did I not say that her call removed the</p><p>last doubt?” replied the minister, his eyes </p><p>twinkling. He turned serious. “James, it </p><p>has helped our—er—your plans, if I’m not </p><p>in error. The woman thinks now that the </p><p>copy has not been missed, and they will </p><p>proceed in this assurance. You can depend </p><p>on it that Herr Kaufman has the dispatch </p><p>in his possession, and will act quickly. In </p><p>fact, I can say-” </p><p> Jimmy waited for him to go on, but Lane</p><p>seemed to have become absorbed in a </p><p>search for his box of cigars. It was not in </p><p>the usual drawer. He found it shortly. </p><p> “Help yourself, James,” he invited. “I</p><p>need something for my nerves after what </p><p>I have been through this morning.” </p><p> His eyes were twinkling again.</p><p> “By the way, sir,” Jimmy said when they</p><p>had lighted up, “another woman has come </p><p>to (own who has got me guessing a little. </p><p>She’s at the Europa, registered as Mrs. </p><p>Rebecca Isaacs of New York.” </p><p> Lane glanced at him, and puffed out a</p><p>cloud of smoke. He said negligently: </p><p> “Mrs. Isaacs? Oh, yes. I’ve had a call</p><p>from her. She’s in trouble. Hunting for </p><p>a friend. I was sorry, but I could see no </p><p>way to aid her. What has she done to </p><p>occasion remark, this Mrs. Isaacs? She </p><p>appeared to be an inoffensive little soul.” </p><p>Jimmy related the series of incidents </p><p>that had come under his notice. As he did,</p><p>he realized how trivial they really seemed. </p><p> “It does sound rather silly, sir,” he con-</p><p>fessed. “If it wasn’t for that roof business </p><p>I don’t suppose I’d have given her a second </p><p>thought. That looked a little queer to me.” </p><p>Lane nodded, but offered no comment. </p><p>Jimmy drew on his cigar a while. </p><p> “Hang it,” he volleyed out all at once,</p><p>“I’m stumped again!” He informed Lane </p><p>rapidly of the anonymous note to Ortega, </p><p>and Enrique’s belief that Mary Taylor </p><p>had sent it. “If she did,” he concluded, </p><p>“we are wrong about the dispatch. She </p><p>wouldn’t help Kaufman with one hand, </p><p>and strike him with the other. It’s not in </p><p>reason.” </p><p>“No,” said Lane laconically, “it isn’t.” </p><p>He did not appear to be greatly surprised </p><p>at the news of the wireless, possibly because </p><p>he had come to suspect Kaufman of some </p><p>secret means of communication with Arraca. </p><p> “Well,” decided Jimmy, “I’m not going</p><p>to bother my head about it any longer. </p><p>What I came for principally, sir, was to </p><p>ask you to renew that luncheon invitation </p><p>of the other day. I want a sight of Kauf- </p><p>man before I come to grips with him.” </p><p>“The lunch—most assuredly, my boy; </p><p>but Herr Kaufman—I have heard that he is </p><p>confined to his room with a bad cold. The </p><p>result of his trip.” </p><p> Jimmy stared at him.</p><p> “Why, then, perhaps he won’t come out</p><p>tonight!” he cried disappointedly. </p><p> “Perhaps,” Lane smiled, “it is to conceal</p><p>his activities. This dispatch means work </p><p>for him. His wireless, James, will be busy </p><p>tonight.” </p><p> “Maybe it won’t,” declared Jimmy,</p><p>much relieved. “Segovia is going to attend </p><p>to that. And that brings me to a favor </p><p>I wish to ask. Segovia was to drive my car. </p><p>As he is assigned to other work I want to use </p><p>Billy Smith. I may want to use him for </p><p>several days.” </p><p> The American minister threw up both</p><p>hands. His face was a picture of con-</p><p>sternation. </p><p> “Impossible!” he gasped. “We are on</p><p>neutral ground. The acts of a pleni- </p><p>potentiary are the acts of the nation he </p><p>represents. It would be-” </p><p> Jimmy impolitely cut him short.</p><p> “Oh, I say Mr. Lane! With Kaufman</p><p>planning to violate Zanhoria’s neutrality </p><p>and compel the United States to intervene? </p><p>We’ve a right to checkmate him. It’s a </p><p>duty, by Jove!” </p><p> “Yes, yes, but to give open aid-”</p><p> “Call it secret aid then,” interrupted</p><p>Jimmy again. “President Hurango is giv- </p><p>ing it, and so can you. Anyway, Billy Smith </p><p>is gone. He’s sick. I told him he was, </p><p>and Mr. Whittaker sent him home. He </p><p>won’t be around till Monday, and you </p><p>needn’t know what he’s doing hi the mean- </p><p>time.” </p><p> The harassed envoy had risen and was</p><p>144 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>striding about the room in a stew of per- </p><p>plexity. But it was subsiding; he could </p><p>see his way out. He brought up at the </p><p>desk as Jimmy finished, and said with a </p><p>severity his’eyes belied: </p><p> “Smith is discharged—ah—ahumph—</p><p>resigned, I should say. It dates from this </p><p>morning. He is no longer connected with the </p><p>legation. It is’not responsible for his acts.” </p><p>Jimmy drew down his mouth in a lugu- </p><p>brious grimace. </p><p> “I am pained to hear it,” he murmured.</p><p>“Mr. Smith impressed me as a young man </p><p>with a future in the diplomatic service. </p><p>Shall we go to lunch, sir? I think I could </p><p>circumvent a tortilla con camerones.” </p><p> “You everlasting young rascal!” sput-</p><p>tered the minister. “You have ruined my </p><p>appetite with this scrape you are leading </p><p>me into. But come on. I hope your </p><p>omelette will choke you.” </p><p> The laugh that had been bubbling under</p><p>the surface brimmed over with this dire </p><p>invocation, and the Hon. John Henry </p><p>gave way to it. Jimmy joined in, and upon </p><p>this scene of mirth the pale face of Mr. </p><p>Whittaker looked in. </p><p> “A cable, sir—personal,” he announced.</p><p>“Ah—ahumph.” The minister grasped </p><p>at the tatered ends of his official dignity </p><p>and drew them about him. “Thank you, </p><p>Whittaker. And—er—Whittaker! Mr. </p><p>Smith has resigned from the staff. He is </p><p>no longer with us.” </p><p> The secretary gulped. This news was</p><p>near to strangling him. </p><p> “S-sir!” he stuttered. “Why I—do I</p><p>understand-” </p><p> “You do. He has resigned. Make an</p><p>entry in the records to that effect, please.” </p><p>The minister waved him away, and took </p><p>his seat at the desk to decode the message. </p><p>Jimmy watched him. He raised his head </p><p>presently, and wagged it at him solemnly. </p><p> “My boy,” he said, “your uncle must</p><p>have done tlu's. It’s the quickest thing </p><p>I’ve ever known.” </p><p> “What is?” asked Jimmy, mystified.</p><p>“The gunboat Lincoln, Lieutenant Norris, </p><p>is ordered from Colon to Puerto Mono. </p><p>And it was only Tuesday that I cabled the </p><p>request! It—why damme, James, it’s as- </p><p>tonishing! I didn’t look for action under </p><p>a week, at the soonest.” </p><p> Jimmy snickered at his thunderstruck</p><p>expression. He couldn’t help it. </p><p> “I reckon it’s the war, sir, not Uncle</p><p>Allan. They’ll be cutting lots of red tape </p><p>up there in Washington before we get </p><p>through with these Germans. So what’s </p><p>the use in wrapping ourselves up with it </p><p>down here?” </p><p> “That,” said Lane quickly, “is an</p><p>altogether different matter. Those shears </p><p>they use can clip off heads as well as tape, </p><p>and I’m not anxious to see mine rolling in </p><p>the basket. No! I’ve given you Smith. </p><p>Make the best of him. It is all you will </p><p>get out of me, James.” </p><p> Jimmy’s teeth showed in a joyous grin,</p><p> “Not quite all, your Excellency—unless</p><p>you are going to renege on that lunch,” he </p><p>remarked. </p><p>BILLY SMITH, like a good soldier, </p><p>followed instructions to the letter. </p><p>Nine o’clock was striking when he </p><p>knocked on Jimmy’s door. But all the </p><p>afternoon he had been burning up, not </p><p>with fever but with a consuming curiosity </p><p>to know what the project was for which </p><p>he had been drafted. </p><p> He found Jimmy sitting by the window,</p><p>smoking a cigar and looking out on the </p><p>lighted plaza and the people taking the </p><p>cooling air. The room was dark except for </p><p>such illumination as came from the hall </p><p>transom and from the square below. </p><p> “Well, here I am, fresh as fish and ready</p><p>to be broiled, boiled or dished up any way </p><p>you say,” announced Billy, striving for an </p><p>unconcern he was far from feeling. </p><p> “There are cigars on the table. Light</p><p>one and sit down,” Jimmy bade him. </p><p> “Huh, what’s this, a Quaker meeting?”</p><p>Billy inquired peevishly, when he had done </p><p>as directed and Jimmy vouchsafed no </p><p>further word with him. “I thought some- </p><p>thing was doing?” </p><p> Jimmy laughed.</p><p> “I was just going over in my mind a few</p><p>tilings,” he answered. “Listen Billy. You </p><p>are not on sick leave. You are out of a job. </p><p>You’ve resigned. Lane told me so. Arson, </p><p>burglary or murder—go as far as you like. </p><p>The legation is not responsible for your </p><p>acts.” </p><p> “The dickens!” squeaked Billy. Then:</p><p>“Say, the old man is a regular fellow when </p><p>he shortens some of the sail he carries, </p><p>isn’t he?” </p><p> “He is. Now pay attention, youngster.</p><p>I’m going to tell you what we are in for, </p><p>you and me.” </p><p>For the Flag </p><p> Jimmy sketched for the eager boy the</p><p>salient happenings of the last few days. </p><p>Billy drank in his words thirstily. </p><p> “I knew something was going on,” he</p><p>cried. “I felt it in my bpnes. And this </p><p>Miss Taylor. I had her right, hey? Gee, </p><p>what a lovely mix-up! How long do you </p><p>suppose we’ve got to wait here?” </p><p> “Until we are sent for. That’s all I</p><p>know.” </p><p> They smoked in silence for a time.</p><p>Billy broke it. </p><p> “That magazine you wanted me to look</p><p>up, Jimmy: established 18V0; circulation </p><p>sixty thousand.” </p><p> “Um,” mused Jimmy. “I could cable</p><p>and find out if she’s really writing for it, </p><p>but what’s the use? I’ll save my com.” </p><p>“Oh!” exclaimed Billy. “Of course Lane </p><p>told you that Mrs. Ikey called? I meant </p><p>to speak of it when you were at the shop, </p><p>but you had me raving with a fever before I </p><p>could get around to it. What did she want </p><p>of his greatness?” </p><p> “Wanted help to find her mislaid uncle,</p><p>Lane said. She was with him only a short </p><p>time I gathered.” </p><p> “What’s that! A short time? She was</p><p>jazzing with him an hour by the clock. I </p><p>took note of it.” </p><p> Jimmy smiled at the picture that pre-</p><p>sented itself. </p><p> “Poor Lane! She must have bored him</p><p>horribly.” </p><p> “He had his compensation later,” giggled</p><p>Billy. “Peaches and cream. Oh, boy!” </p><p>They talked on for a while, gradually </p><p>running down until finally they lapsed into </p><p>a hushed companionship of waiting. Ten </p><p>o’clock had rung out from La Caridad long </p><p>since. Now it struck eleven. Billy re- </p><p>marked on it lazily. </p><p> “Sounds like some big old buoy bell.”</p><p> A correlation of ideas brought to Jimmy’s</p><p>mind a thing he had forgotten to mention</p><p>to Billy. He said: </p><p> “Washington is sending us a warship</p><p>from Colon. Lane got word this noon </p><p>after you’d gone. The Lincoln, Lieutenant </p><p>Norris in command. Know it?” </p><p> “Oh, gosh!” groaned Billy. “That old</p><p>tub? It’s a single-screw converted gun- </p><p>boat. A few four-inch rifles and some six- </p><p>pounders. You can squeeze ten knots out </p><p>of her if you don’t care if she falls apart. </p><p>Why didn’t they send something with heels </p><p>to it?” </p><p> “It will get to Puerto Mono in time to</p><p>keep Peralta from landing.” </p><p> “Pish!” snorted Billy. “But we should</p><p>worry. It’s Popper Kaufman we’re after. </p><p>If we get him Peralta will blow up with his </p><p>own gas.” </p><p> “You are forgetting something,” Jimmy</p><p>said soberly. “We may blow up instead. </p><p>We haven’t any cinch on this job we’ve </p><p>undertaken.” </p><p> They heard hurried steps in the hall.</p><p>Some one rapped on the door. Billy </p><p>jumped to his feet, but Jimmy was before </p><p>him, and opened to the messenger, Mr- </p><p>Ricardo Gomez. It was the clerk’s “night </p><p>on.” He tumbled out his words breath- </p><p>lessly. </p><p> “I come myself, Mr. Perree—d todo correr.</p><p>It is urgent. Senor Enrique Segovia, he </p><p>have encounter a delabrement—a damage </p><p>to him. He would see you, sir, Mr. Perree. </p><p>A car it attends.” </p><p> “Here’s a mess!” exclaimed Billy. “We</p><p>can’t-” </p><p> Jimmy shut him off with a peremptory</p><p>gesture. He turned to Gomez. </p><p> “You say he has sent a car for us?”</p><p> “It attends, yes. ‘I have been send for</p><p>Mr. Perree,’ the chauffeur remark to </p><p> “We’ll go,” Jimmy interrupted, a light</p><p>breaking on him. “Grab that box of cigars </p><p>on the bureau, Billy. Get a move on.”</p><p> As he pocketed his door-key Jimmy</p><p>observed that Mrs. Isaacs’ room was dark. </p><p>Either she had slipped in very quietly, or </p><p>she was staying out very late. It was just </p><p>a thought that crossed his mind, and it </p><p>went as it had come, leaving no impression. </p><p>10 </p><p>TO BE CONTINUED </p><p> THE TRAIL AT LANDRY '</p><p>ty Ncvil G.Hensk&amp;w </p><p>Author of "The Killer, the Kid, and the Bad Man,” “For France," etc. </p><p>I , , ifTTS is an age of wholesale con- </p><p>I * I " I version. In the cities of the </p><p>I East and West noted evan- </p><p>1 ' gelists herd thousands into has- </p><p>tily constructed tabernacles and, by dint </p><p>of fiery words, and still more fiery gestures, </p><p>invoke their religious zeal. Thus, when the </p><p>blaze of fervor burns its fiercest, an end is </p><p>accomplished—an end involving an open </p><p>profession of faith, sealed by means of a </p><p>handclasp with no less a person than the </p><p>evangelist himself. This, in the present </p><p>jargon inevitable to all movements of mag- </p><p>nitude, is known as “Hitting the Trail.” </p><p> In the French, or Cajun parishes of</p><p>southwestern Louisiana noted evangelists </p><p>are unknown. There the people are for the </p><p>most part of one creed, so that the congre- </p><p>gations of the various curts form a fairly </p><p>complete census of the population. Yet </p><p>even here certain spiritual slackers turn a </p><p>deaf ear to the voice of duty, causing the </p><p>good fathers to labor mightily in their </p><p>effort to set these wayward feet upon the </p><p>trail. </p><p> All of which brings us finally to the affair</p><p>of old man Polyte Greig. </p><p>I </p><p>IT WAS the feast of All Saints </p><p>and, in the words of Landry folk, </p><p>old man Polyte was “at it again.” </p><p>He stood upon the porch of the coffee- </p><p>house, his body flattened out against one </p><p>of the broad, supporting pillars, his right </p><p>arm rising at regular intervals to the ac- </p><p>companying kick and crash of his ancient, </p><p>heavy revolver. Outside, in the live-oak </p><p>grove that shaded the village square, the </p><p>Varo brothers wove their ponies in and </p><p>out of the protecting tree-trunks, as they </p><p>pumped their answering shots into the </p><p>echoing emptiness of the coffee-house porch. </p><p> Inside the bar such unfortunate patrons</p><p>as had been cut off from an escape to the </p><p>rear, crouched low in their comers, voicing </p><p>a general complaint that old man Polyte </p><p>should have chosen the pillar in line with</p><p>the open front door. And from behind the </p><p>bar itself came a wail of anguish as Savoy, </p><p>the proprietor, hearkened to the havoc </p><p>wrought by stray bullets amid his carefully </p><p>arranged bottles and glassware. </p><p> The origin of the trouble dated back some</p><p>two years before. Then there had been </p><p>three Varo brothers, Paul, Jules and Bebe. </p><p>Following a quarrel between old man Polyte </p><p>and Paul the number had been reduced to </p><p>two. This should have ended the affair, </p><p>especially as the grand jury in the near-by </p><p>city of Mouton had returned a verdict of </p><p>self-defense in old man Polyte’s favor. </p><p> The remaining Varos, however, had been</p><p>dissatisfied with this verdict. Hence there </p><p>had developed a species of guerilla warfare </p><p>involving numerous pitched battles, each </p><p>of them staged at Landry. Also, since your </p><p>Cajun dearly loves a fight, there had been </p><p>no attempt at interference. </p><p>They were something to look forward to, </p><p>these clashes that occurred whenever the </p><p>Varos rode in for a feast-day. There was a </p><p>quality of unexpectedness about them that </p><p>was fascinating. The Varos chose no par- </p><p>ticular time for their onslaughts. It might </p><p>The Trail at Landry </p><p>147 </p><p>be morning, or noon, or the edge of twilight, </p><p>when a thudding of hoofs and a shouting </p><p>of profane challenges would announce their </p><p>arrival. Then old man Polyte would arise </p><p>from his interminable euchre to bang away </p><p>with his venerable Colt until such time as </p><p>the Varos chose to take their departure. </p><p> Now, whereas these combats might ap-</p><p>pear to possess a certain inequality in point </p><p>of numbers, this inequality was made up </p><p>for by the mode of attack. For if old man </p><p>Polyte fought one man against two, he also </p><p>fought on his feet with his weapon at rest, </p><p>while his opponents sought such meager </p><p>results as could be obtained from the backs </p><p>of their wildly cavorting ponies. Indeed, </p><p>if there existed an advantage, this advan- </p><p>tage was probably on the side of old man </p><p>Polyte. At all events it was considered </p><p>fair fight at Landry, which was enough. </p><p> Thanks to this method of warfare, the</p><p>combatants had thus far emerged un- </p><p>scathed, or at most with trifling wounds. </p><p>It was held, however, that such a condition </p><p>could not prevail forever. Sooner or later </p><p>a serious injury or even a death would </p><p>occur, invoking the law at Mouton. </p><p> Accordingly the present affair was fol-</p><p>lowed with especial interest by such of the </p><p>inhabitants and visitors as were in the </p><p>rear, or safely out of range. They watched </p><p>with the intent yet pensive air of folk who </p><p>await the curtain upon some well-known </p><p>and long-cherished drama. </p><p> For a time the conflict ran true to form.</p><p>Shouting, whipping, firing, the Varos dodged </p><p>about the grove amid the frenzied shying </p><p>and bridle-snapping of the various teams </p><p>that were hitched about them. From his </p><p>stronghold old man Polyte replied delib- </p><p>erately and mechanically, as one who per- </p><p>forms an oft-repeated public duty. Nor </p><p>did he so much as flinch when an occasional </p><p>well-aimed shot smacked into the pillar </p><p>before him. They built well at Landry, </p><p>and inside the hollow square was a sup- </p><p>porting round of solid cypress. </p><p> The watchers, observing this well-ordered</p><p>procedure, took heart of grace. Perhaps, </p><p>after all, the next feast-day would not lack</p><p>its usual excitement. </p><p> It was precisely at this moment that the</p><p>long-dreaded catastrophe occurred. Who </p><p>fired the shot, whether Jules or Bebe Varo, </p><p>was never determined. It was only known </p><p>that the bullet struck an edge of the pillar, </p><p>and then, by some abominable freak of luck, </p><p> glanced off and around to enter the body</p><p>of its lone defender. </p><p> With a grunt of pain, old man Polyte</p><p>dropped his weapon and swung out to the </p><p>edge of the porch. Here he stood for a </p><p>moment, fumbling at his chest, his expres- </p><p>sion changing Trom vague uncertainty to </p><p>startled realization. </p><p> “Behold, I am killed,” he announced</p><p>thickly. </p><p> Then, all of a sudden, he collapsed,</p><p>plumping over in a heap upon the ground. </p><p> As for the Varos, so great was their sur-</p><p>prise, that they would have proven easy </p><p>prey for any who might have wished to </p><p>apprehend them. But there was no estab- </p><p>lished law at Landry, and so, having re- </p><p>covered themselves, the brothers wheeled </p><p>about and loped rapidly out of town. </p><p>II </p><p>ALL this time Pere Martain, the </p><p>cure of Landry, had been looking </p><p>on from his churchyard beyond the </p><p>live-oak grove. He was a small man, very </p><p>old and fragile, yet in his pale, quiet eyes </p><p>there shone a light of unconquerable cour- </p><p>age and determination. With the departure </p><p>of the Varos and the surging forward of the </p><p>crowd, he too hurried across the square. </p><p> At the coffee-house he found all in con-</p><p>fusion. Men hurried this way and that, </p><p>calling for a doctor, a priest; while others </p><p>realizing the gravity of the affair, set out </p><p>to inform the authorities at Mouton. Push- </p><p>ing his way through the excited throng </p><p>upon the porch, Pere Martain entered the </p><p>bar and bent over the wounded man. </p><p> At sight of him old man Polyte moved</p><p>uneasily. </p><p> “That is all right, Mon Pere,” said he in</p><p>a low, stubborn voice. “I will go as I </p><p>have lived. I am not one for a death-bed </p><p>conversion.” </p><p>The priest made a gesture of impatience. </p><p> “Do not be ridiculous, Hippolyte,” he</p><p>reproved. “I am here first'to inquire into </p><p>the seriousness of your wound. When that </p><p>is determined it will be time to speak of </p><p>death-bed conversions.” </p><p> Again Pere Martain bent to his task,</p><p>while the crowd looked on with respectful </p><p>attention. He knew something of wounds, </p><p>this little priest, who had been chaplain of </p><p>Vigilantes during the bitter days of the </p><p>reconstruction. Until the doctor arrived, </p><p>148 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>and most probably afterward, his verdict </p><p>would be accepted as final. </p><p> “It is only the shoulder, and high up at</p><p>that, Ilippolyte,” he now announced. </p><p>“Thus you are denied your desire for an </p><p>impenitent end.” </p><p> Having made his point, Pere Martain</p><p>did not linger. At once he departed out- </p><p>side, where there closed in upon him cer- </p><p>tain of the inhabitants who sought to </p><p>prolong the fast-waning excitement by re- </p><p>counting the affair to each unfortunate who </p><p>happened along. Thus Pere Martain was </p><p>forced to submit himself to a personally </p><p>conducted tour of the scene, which began </p><p>at the exact spot occupied by old man </p><p>Polyte behind the pillar, and ended with </p><p>the depression made by his fallen body </p><p>amid the rank grass at the edge of the </p><p>porch. </p><p> It was while exhibiting this depression</p><p>that Prejean, the baker, made a discovery. </p><p>Catching a metallic glint beneath one of </p><p>the grass tufts, he drew forth a small, flat- </p><p>tish object, which he held up between a </p><p>thumb and forefinger. </p><p> “See, it is Polyte’s saint,” he exclaimed.</p><p>“Evidently it fell from his pocket when </p><p>they were carrying him inside.” </p><p> At this Pere Martain exhibited an inter-</p><p>est that had been wholly lacking before. </p><p>Taking the object, he discovered it to be </p><p>a small, metal case which, when handled, </p><p>gave forth a faint, rattling sound. Next </p><p>opening the case, Pere Martain up-ended </p><p>it, and dumped into his palm a leaden image. </p><p>The image was squat and heavy, and its </p><p>features suggested a grotesque and impish </p><p>mirth. </p><p> “So,” mused Pere Martain. “Then this</p><p>is Hippolyte’s saint? You are quite sure?” </p><p>“Absolutely,” replied Prejean. “It goes </p><p>with him all the time.” </p><p> “Then,” said the priest, as he turned</p><p>away, “this is a matter in which I may well </p><p>take a hand.” </p><p> That night Pere Martain got the image</p><p>and studied it long and carefully by the </p><p>light of his lamp. Being more or less of </p><p>an authority upon saints, he entertained no </p><p>illusion from the first; yet he felt that here </p><p>was an affair in which he must not trust </p><p>entirely to his own judgment. All along </p><p>he had struggled with the impiety of old </p><p>man Polyte, and such a thing as a possible </p><p>advantage was not to be treated lightly. </p><p> In the end Pere Martain determined that</p><p>he would take the image to Mouton. There </p><p>he would show it to his friend, Monsieur </p><p>Decourt. In his position of notary, Mon- </p><p>sieur Decourt was supposed to know every- </p><p>thing that was worth knowing at all. </p><p>Ill </p><p>FOUR days later Pere Martain </p><p>pocketed the image and set out for </p><p>the dilapidated hut that old man </p><p>Polyte occupied upon the edge of the vil- </p><p>lage. As he trudged along, the good priest </p><p>considered how best he might make use </p><p>of his discovery. For years he had striven </p><p>with this particular sinner, only to abandon </p><p>him as hopeless. Now it appeared that </p><p>there might be some chance for his redemp- </p><p>tion. </p><p> A man who carried about a saint could</p><p>not be wholly without belief. Inside him </p><p>must glow some spark of faith which, if </p><p>properly fanned, would kindle the fires of </p><p>devotion. </p><p> Thus Pere Martain argued with himself;</p><p>but, as he did so, he remembered that old </p><p>man Polyte was a master of craft, of subtle </p><p>evasion. If given a chance, he would be </p><p>quick to smother this spark of belief beneath </p><p>the ashes of deceit. He must be ap- </p><p>proached warily, and with an abruptness </p><p>that would defeat his powers of evasion. </p><p>A victory could be accomplished only </p><p>through the element of surprise. </p><p> As he had expected, Pere Martain found</p><p>the wounded man well upon the road to </p><p>recovery. Indeed, he was already propped </p><p>up in the narrow bunk that was nailed to </p><p>one side of his small, stuffy room. His </p><p>greetings over, Pere Martain seated . him- </p><p>self upon an empty box that did duty as a </p><p>chair. </p><p> “Well, Hippolyte,” he began, “and so</p><p>you have not made your expected ‘go’ after </p><p>all?” </p><p>The sufferer grinned a trifle shamefacedly. </p><p> “All the same, it is no fun, this getting</p><p>a bullet in one’s body,” he replied. “At </p><p>first it is like the end of everything.” </p><p> “Yet, believing this, you refused salva-</p><p>tion?” said the priest sternly. “Hippolyte, </p><p>I am ashamed of you. Even though you </p><p>care nothing for your own soul, you should </p><p>at least consider the example you set to </p><p>those about you.” </p><p>The listener squirmed uncomfortably, </p><p>while a dull, harrassed look came into his </p><p>The Trail at Landry </p><p>149 </p><p>eyes. Evidently he was intensely bored. </p><p> “What is the use of going over all that</p><p>again, Mon Phre?” he complained. “As </p><p>I have told you many times, I would be- </p><p>lieve if I could. Since I can not, there is </p><p>nothing more to say.” </p><p> “Bien,” agreed the priest. “If you can</p><p>not believe, if you can tell me truthfully </p><p>that you have no spark of faith, however </p><p>small, there is indeed nothing more to say.” </p><p>“I have already said it,” returned old </p><p>man Polyte. “For the rest, how would it </p><p>profit me to lie to you?” </p><p> Pere Martain’s moment had come. He</p><p>was very sincere, yet he could not resist a </p><p>dramatic flourish as he drew forth and </p><p>held out the image. </p><p> “Then what have you to say to this?”</p><p>he demanded. </p><p> To his surprise, old man Polyte betrayed</p><p>no consternation. Rather his expression was </p><p>one of relief, while in his eyes shone an un- </p><p>doubted light of recognition. </p><p> “My saint,” he exclaimed. “I knew</p><p>that, sooner or later, it would come to </p><p>hght.” </p><p> “Then—then you admit that it is yours?”</p><p>questioned Pere Martain uncertainly. </p><p> “And why not, since I have carried it</p><p>ever since my wife gave it to me?” coun- </p><p>tered old man Polyte. “It was this way. </p><p>My old woman bought the saint at the </p><p>fair at Mouton, and always she treasured </p><p>it; for the man told her that with it would </p><p>come good fortune. When she was dying </p><p>she passed it on to me. ‘Take it, Polyte, </p><p>even though you have no faith,’ she said. </p><p>‘Carry it about with you, and it will keep </p><p>you from harm.’ It was a little thing, and </p><p>I have obeyed her wish. That is all.” </p><p> Pere Martain sighed resignedly. He</p><p>saw that, for this once at least, the other </p><p>spoke the truth. The mystery was ex- </p><p>plained. There had been no spark after all. </p><p> “So, Hippolyte,” said he. “I under-</p><p>stand. Also I commend you for thus re- </p><p>membering your dead wife. Perhaps, as </p><p>she said, the image will keep you from </p><p>harm.” He paused and added hopefully— </p><p>“Perhaps it has done so already.” </p><p> Old man Polyte shrugged. He now spoke</p><p>as one sure of himself. </p><p> “My old woman was like that,” he re-</p><p>plied. “As for me, I can only judge by </p><p>what has occurred. In that last fight </p><p>my saint was with me all the time, yet here </p><p>I am struck down by a bullet.” </p><p> “And what of those other fights?” ques-</p><p>tioned Pere Martain. </p><p> Old man Polyte shook his head.</p><p> “It is this way,” said he. “A thing</p><p>works, or it does not work. As you see, </p><p>the saint has not worked. If ever it does, </p><p>I promise that you will hear from me.” </p><p> Pere Martain rose at once. Coming</p><p>from old man Polyte, this was all that </p><p>could be expected. </p><p> “It is a bargain, Hippolyte,” said he</p><p>quickly. “When the time comes I will </p><p>hold you to it. Wait and you will see.” </p><p> Thereupon Pere Martain departed in a</p><p>state of mind not altogether unhopeful. </p><p>He had great faith; and, despite his faults, </p><p>old man Polyte was always as good as his </p><p>given word. </p><p>IV </p><p>roRJI IN SIX days more old man Polyte </p><p>jj^Ll was up and about his affairs. As </p><p> for these affairs, had they been</p><p>separated into two grand divisions, these </p><p>would have comprised pot-hunting and </p><p>euchre. When in need of money old man </p><p>Polyte slaughtered the ducks that infested </p><p>the lake near Landry. At other times he </p><p>might be found at the second of the three </p><p>card-tables in Savoy’s coffee-house. </p><p> Upon returning to the life of the village</p><p>old man Polyte made a most pleasing dis- </p><p>covery. He found that, during the brief </p><p>space of his confinement, he had become </p><p>a sort of hero. Yet this rise in the esteem</p><p>of his fellow men appeared to be due less </p><p>to his personal achievements than to the </p><p>events consequent upon them. </p><p> Thanks to the supposed gravity of his</p><p>wound, the law had appeared at Landry. </p><p>The sfieriff had ridden out to arrest the </p><p>Varos. Afterward there had been an in- </p><p>vestigation. During one whole day offi- </p><p>cers had galloped about creating an excite- </p><p>ment that would be spoken of for months </p><p>to come. In brief, Landry had been put </p><p>upon the map of the parish and, as all </p><p>agreed, old man Polyte had put it </p><p>there. </p><p> Be it said of old man Polyte that he made</p><p>the most of his opportunity. Where another </p><p>would have boasted his way into speedy </p><p>disfavor, he preserved a most gratifying </p><p>and profitable silence. Upon being ques- </p><p>tioned as to his now historic, “Behold, I </p><p>am killed,” he merely shrugged, as one who </p><p>would say, “That is my affair.” </p><p>150 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Following which the inhabitants attrib-</p><p>uted to him a most amazing foresight. </p><p> “He is a keen one, that Polyte,” they</p><p>said. “Whether he imagined himself killed </p><p>or not, he saw and grasped the opportunity </p><p>that has made us prominent.” </p><p> After this old man Polyte’s position was</p><p>secure. Finding both friends and credit at </p><p>the coffee-house, he established himself </p><p>permanently at the second of the two card- </p><p>tables, leaving the ducks to fly unmolested </p><p>above the marshes of the lake. It was a </p><p>period of peace for the former hunter, a </p><p>period unmarred by any bothersome de- </p><p>tails of finance. </p><p> If he won at his euchre, he was that much</p><p>ahead. If he lost, he merely gave his </p><p>friends a chance to further expound the </p><p>beauties of civic gratitude. As for the </p><p>drinks—just now old man Polyte’s pres- </p><p>ence meant business. So long as this con- </p><p>dition prevailed, Savoy would continue to </p><p>serve them. </p><p> Yet for all this, old man Polyte was not</p><p>long in finding the inevitable fly in the oint- </p><p>ment of his content. Or rather, it was two </p><p>flies, personified by the brothers Varo. </p><p> Following old man Polyte’s recovery, the</p><p>authorities had dealt promptly with the </p><p>Varos. Also they had dealt severely. Per- </p><p>haps the authorities felt that they had been </p><p>tricked into making a great deal of fuss </p><p>over a very ordinary brawl. Perhaps they </p><p>were simply wearied by the continued law- </p><p>lessness at Landry. Be this as it may, they </p><p>sentenced the Varos to six months’ work </p><p>upon the public roads. </p><p> Now to the Varos this sentence was un-</p><p>supportable. Far more would they have </p><p>preferred the penitentiary or even the gal- </p><p>lows. In that event their punishment </p><p>would have partaken of the heroic. To </p><p>their friends they would have appeared as </p><p>martyrs. </p><p> But six months of shoveling ahead of a</p><p>ball and chain! It was as ridiculous as it </p><p>was disgraceful. They had shot a man, </p><p>and they were treated like chicken-thieves.</p><p> Yet, strangely enough, the Varos bore no</p><p>resentment against those responsible for </p><p>their degradation. They placed the blame </p><p>wholly upon the aged shoulders of old man </p><p>Polyte. It was all his fault, they declared. </p><p>He should have died, as he said he would, </p><p>or at least have made a poor recovery. </p><p>Then they would have been punished in a </p><p>manner befitting their endeavors. </p><p> But, thanks to a merciful Providence,</p><p>the matter was not past mending, as old man </p><p>Polyte should presently learn. They would </p><p>get him the moment they were out again. </p><p> All of which, being duly reported at Lan-</p><p>dry, caused old man Polyte to enter upon a </p><p>period of uncomfortable reflection. How- </p><p>ever, he consoled himself with the thought </p><p>that six months was a long time, and that </p><p>the game of “getting” was one at which </p><p>three could play as well as two. </p><p> So the days slipped by while the ancient</p><p>sinner prospered, a worse example than </p><p>ever before. So Pere Martain waited, grip- </p><p>ping hard to his faith, assuring himself that, </p><p>in the event of success, his victory must </p><p>now be all the greater. So the public </p><p>gratitude grew worn and threadbare as, if </p><p>given time, public gratitude always will. </p><p> Then, one day when old man Polyte sat</p><p>down to his euchre, the end arrived. </p><p> “One moment, Polyte,” said the others</p><p>at the table. “Have you any money? </p><p>Otherwise, there is no place for you. Already </p><p>you owe us more than we can afford.” </p><p> A little later, upon the demand of a</p><p>drink, Savoy replied: </p><p> “This time, yes, Polyte. But afterward</p><p>you must pay. I have worn out no less </p><p>than two pencils in keeping your score.” </p><p> Old man Polyte saw and understood.</p><p>Also he accepted with good grace. He had </p><p>had a good time, and he knew that good </p><p>times could not last forever. Besides, it </p><p>was Friday—always an unlucky day. </p><p> That night old man Polyte cleaned his</p><p>huge muzzle-loader, and took count of his </p><p>powder and shot. Daybreak found him </p><p>behind his favorite blind, far out in the</p><p>heart of the marsh. </p><p> Thus old man Polyte missed a most</p><p>startling piece of news that was brought </p><p>in by the first early arrivals at the coffee- </p><p>house. This news came from Mouton, and </p><p>concerned the Varos. The previous after- </p><p>noon they had overpowered their guard and, </p><p>having taken his pistol, had escaped; pre- </p><p>sumably into the impenetrable cypress </p><p>swamp that encircled the parish upon the </p><p>east. </p><p>V </p><p>IT HAD been a good hunt, and old </p><p>man Polyte was satisfied. He had </p><p>bagged a nice bunch of duck and, </p><p>during a slack in the flight shortly after sun- </p><p>rise, he had managed to slip aside to a </p><p>The Trail at Landry </p><p>near-by burn, and gather in quite a respect- </p><p>able string of snipe. Therefore, shortly </p><p>after noon, he decided that, for several rea- </p><p>sons, he would be justified in calling it a </p><p>day’s work. </p><p> To begin with he had hunted the farther</p><p>marsh, which involved not only the tramp </p><p>to his boat, but a long row across the lake. </p><p>Then he must dispose of his game. With </p><p>poor luck, there might be no euchre before </p><p>night. However, the next day was Sun- </p><p>day, and Sundays were always long and </p><p>pleasant at the coffee-house. </p><p> It lacked but a little of two o’clock when</p><p>old man Polyte broke through the marsh </p><p>rim at the point where he had left his boat. </p><p>The going had been bad, and the long string </p><p>of game had become an intolerable burden. </p><p>As he pushed off, old man Polyte wished </p><p>that he had a pirogue instead of his clumsy, </p><p>heavy skiff. But pirogues held little, and </p><p>were most capricious in the matter of over- </p><p>turning. Also the waters of the lake were </p><p>cold and deep. </p><p> It was shortly after he had left the bank</p><p>and had settled down to a steady pull that </p><p>old man Polyte saw a pirogue slip out from </p><p>the bank a short distance above his starting </p><p>place. Two men were in the pirogue and, </p><p>as they paddled swiftly out, they held a </p><p>course that would bring them directly </p><p>athwart the path of the skiff. Observing </p><p>which, old man Polyte rested his oars in </p><p>anticipation of some friendly demand or </p><p>greeting. </p><p> When it was still quite a distance off the</p><p>pirogue halted abruptly, and a voice shouted </p><p>a challenge across the intervening stretch </p><p>of water. It was a slow, unsteady voice, </p><p>thick with suppressed excitement and a </p><p>too liberal indulgence in stolen brandy, yet </p><p>old man Polyte had little difficulty in recog- </p><p>nizing it as the voice of Bebe Varo. </p><p> For a moment old man Polyte was over-</p><p>come by his absolute amazement. He </p><p>could only falter weakly in reply— </p><p> “And so—and so—you are out again?”</p><p> “As you see,” came back the voice. “We</p><p>are on our way to safety, but first there is </p><p>your little account to settle.”</p><p> To this there seemed but one logical</p><p>reply. Snatching his gun, old man Polyte </p><p>emptied both barrels at the speaker. His </p><p>intentions were good, but his opponents </p><p>had chosen their distance carefully. Save </p><p>for a wild scatter of water several yards out </p><p>from his mark, old man Polyte found that </p><p>he had only wasted two charges of his wo- </p><p>fully diminished powder and shot. </p><p> The Varos took their own good time in</p><p>answering him. Indeed, so long was B6b£ </p><p>Varo in steadying himself and aiming his </p><p>pistol that old man Polyte had a brief hope </p><p>that his enemies had run out of shells and </p><p>were merely trying to scare him. But when </p><p>a moment later the bullet came whining </p><p>above the skiff old man Polyte ducked and </p><p>considered his situation. He was out- </p><p>ranged, and his enemies had the whole </p><p>afternoon before them. The outlook was </p><p>anything but encouraging. </p><p> After a second shot which splintered the</p><p>skiff’s rail, old man Polyte seized his oars </p><p>and rowed blindly out toward the middle </p><p>of the lake. The Varos followed leisurely </p><p>until, realizing the hoplessness of his flight, </p><p>the fugitive came to rest again. Thereupon </p><p>the Varos followed their former tactics, only </p><p>this time it was Jules who shot, his bullets </p><p>going wider than those of the more accurate </p><p>Bebe. </p><p> From this old man Polyte deducted that</p><p>his enemies had but a single weapon be- </p><p>tween them, yet the discovery brought him </p><p>little comfort. Evidently they were well </p><p>supplied with shells, and one pistol was </p><p>amply sufficient for their purpose. </p><p> In the intervals between ducking and</p><p>dodging below the skiff edge, old man </p><p>Polyte emptied his gun twice in the direc- </p><p>tion of the pirogue. He did this aimlessly </p><p>and half-heartedly, more from the desire </p><p>to be doing something than for any other </p><p>reason. Then, finding himself reduced to </p><p>a bare four loads, he crouched low and began </p><p>to consider his plight to its final detail. </p><p> He was in a tight place and, so far as he</p><p>could see, there was little prospect of his </p><p>getting out with a whole skin. Any thought </p><p>of a rescue he dismissed at once. The lake </p><p>was wide and lonely, and a chance passer-by</p><p>would not be allowed to interfere. The </p><p>Varos would see to that. Escape was </p><p>equally hopeless. The pirogue could over- </p><p>haul him without effort and, once across and </p><p>in the heavy going of the marsh, his oppo- </p><p>nents could easily pick him off from their </p><p>firmer footing ashore. </p><p> True, if he could hold out until after</p><p>sunset, he might get away under cover of </p><p>the darkness; but this was hardly to be </p><p>expected. Evidently the Varos were only </p><p>playing with him while their pursuers </p><p>scoured the swamp. With the coming of </p><p>152 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>night they, too, would be faced with the </p><p>necessity of escape. Before the light failed </p><p>they would most certainly risk a dash inside </p><p>the dead-line. But even the chance of this </p><p>was remote. Sooner or later they must get </p><p>in a lucky shot that would render their </p><p>finishing the affair a mere matter of pad- </p><p>dling alongside. </p><p> The next half-hour was the longest and</p><p>hardest that old man Polyte had ever </p><p>known. The prospect of violent death </p><p>was bad enough, but worst of all was the </p><p>grim silence of the Varos. If they had </p><p>reviled him, if they had taunted him, it </p><p>would have been easier. Then, infuriated </p><p>by their jeers, he might have achieved a </p><p>state where he would have been wholly </p><p>reckless of the consequences. </p><p> But, save for their first challenge, the</p><p>Varos hung on sullen and wordless. Per- </p><p>haps they counted upon the effect of their </p><p>muteness. Perhaps they realized that this </p><p>was no light-hearted duel, but a matter </p><p>of cold-blooded assassination. At all events </p><p>they uttered no heartening gibe or oath, even </p><p>lowering their voices to an indistinct mur- </p><p>mur when they spoke between themselves. </p><p> Jules, who steadied the pirogue, would</p><p>occasionally refresh himself from a bottle </p><p>which he raised with his free hand. B6be, </p><p>displaying a truly remarkable self-denial, </p><p>touched never a drop. However, as he had </p><p>taken over the shooting entirely, the cause </p><p>of his abstinence was only too plain. </p><p> As for old man Polyte, he could only sit</p><p>and watch for the next attack. Then it </p><p>was squirm, and twist, and flounder, until </p><p>the fusillade was safely over. </p><p> Shortly after three o’clock a bullet grazed</p><p>the fleshy part of old man Polyte’s right </p><p>arm. The wound was trifling, but its sig- </p><p>nificance was great. Each time now Bebe </p><p>shot closer. Also, emboldened by their </p><p>success, the Varos pushed in for a distance </p><p>of several strokes. Firing an experimentary </p><p>shot, old man Polyte found that his charge </p><p>just managed to rattle lightly against the </p><p>pirogue’s side. At this the Varos broke </p><p>their long silence with a laugh. Evidently </p><p>the end was close at hand.</p><p> Realizing this, old man Polyte cast a final,</p><p>sweeping glance about the lake. Far away </p><p>a’sailboat was tacking close inshore, and he </p><p>waved at it frantically. But either the </p><p>crew misunderstood, or felt no desire to </p><p>become embroiled in another’s quarrel. The </p><p>boat tacked on. </p><p> Thus, for the first time, old man Polyte</p><p>began seriously to consider the question of </p><p>a future life. He thought of prayer, and </p><p>wondered vaguely if it would do any good. </p><p>Then he remembered his saint, and a flash </p><p>of sardonic humor caused him to withdraw </p><p>the case and tumble out the image upon his </p><p>leathery palm. A moment he glared at the </p><p>tiny figure, answering its grin with a fierce, </p><p>malevolent snarl. </p><p> “You are a fine saint,” he growled. “As</p><p>a protector you are no more good than one </p><p>of Beb6’s bullets. Bien, you will go where </p><p>you belong, overside.” </p><p> With his arm upraised and ready to</p><p>throw, old man Polyte had another idea. </p><p>It now occurred to him that the image was </p><p>like a bullet in still another way. It was </p><p>round, and leaden, and heavy—a very </p><p>proper slug, in fact. If he loaded it and </p><p>shot straight enough, he might get Bebe </p><p>Varo. Afterward the rest would be easy. </p><p> With one eye upon the Varos, old man</p><p>Polyte began to load the empty barrel of </p><p>his gun. He worked feverishly, yet he </p><p>took care to put in an extra heavy charge </p><p>of powder. Next he tinkled down the </p><p>image, ramming it home with a thick wad- </p><p>ding of newspaper. </p><p> His enemies looked on derisively. Not</p><p>only had they moved in to improve their </p><p>range. They had also hoped for just this </p><p>final expenditure of their victim’s ammuni- </p><p>tion. Of the consequences they had not </p><p>the slightest fear. They knew that, had </p><p>old man Polyte been possessed of anything </p><p>heavier than birdshot he would have used </p><p>it at the start. </p><p> His loading finished, old man Polyte</p><p>leveled his gun, steadying it upon the edge </p><p>of the skiff. Very carefully he shifted the </p><p>barrel until it covered a spot directly in the </p><p>center of Bebe Varo’s chest. Then, before </p><p>he pulled, he invoked the image, pleading</p><p>with it in a muffled undertone. </p><p> “Come, Saint, come,” he muttered.</p><p>“You can do it if you will.” </p><p> At the report Bebe Varo jerked suddenly</p><p>to his knees. There he swung for a mo- </p><p>ment, uttering a strange, guttural cry that </p><p>was not unlike the croak of a frog. Then </p><p>he pitched forward, capsizing the pirogue </p><p>in a smother of icy water. </p><p> This much old man Polyte saw as he</p><p>snatched his oars. An instant later, when </p><p>he straightened up again, Bebe Varo was </p><p>gone. Jules, shivering and gasping, pawed </p><p>The Trail at Landry </p><p>153 </p><p>desperately at the slimy, bobbing bottom </p><p>of the overturned pirogue. He was so close </p><p>that, had he wished to, the watcher could </p><p>have reached him by shoving out an oar. </p><p> “Good saint,” murmured old man Polyte</p><p>as he picked up his gun. And, while cocking </p><p>it, “My old woman was right.” </p><p> Emulating the Varos, he took his own</p><p>good time with the second barrel. He felt </p><p>that, under the circumstances, the least he </p><p>could do was to make a good job of it. </p><p>VI </p><p>AT NINE o’clock the following </p><p>morning old man Polyte knocked </p><p>upon Pere Martain’s front door. </p><p>In his eyes there was a furtive, hunted look, </p><p>yet the outthrust of his lean jaw suggested </p><p>a stubborn determination. </p><p> Answering the summons himself, Pere</p><p>Martain came out upon the porch. </p><p> “Well, Hippolyte?” said he.</p><p> Old man Polyte uncovered, answering the</p><p>greeting with a brief downward jerk of his </p><p>head. </p><p> “You have heard, Mon Pere?" he ques-</p><p>tioned. </p><p> “I have,” answered the priest. “That</p><p>is why I sent for you.” </p><p> Old man Polyte glanced up, then down.</p><p>He seemed terribly ill at ease. </p><p> “About the saint,” he muttered. “I am</p><p>sorry, Mon Pere. I hope that it was not </p><p>sacrilege?” </p><p> If Pere Martain felt inclined to smile,</p><p>he betrayed the fact by not so much as the </p><p>twitching of a muscle. </p><p> “No, it was not sacrilege,” he replied.</p><p>“Besides there was nothing else to do.” </p><p> “So,” said old man Polyte, his tone hint-</p><p>ing at dejection rather than relief. </p><p> “Well, Hippolyte?” repeated the priest,</p><p>this time in a voice that could not be </p><p>denied. </p><p> There fell a pause during which old man</p><p>Polyte was swayed by indecision. Just </p><p>behind him lay the coffee-house with its </p><p>warmth, its snugness, its never-ending good </p><p>cheer. There he would be more of a hero </p><p>than ever. A seat of honor awaited him at </p><p>the second of the three card-tables. In </p><p>front was the church with its cold interior, </p><p>its hard kneeling benches, its long, scourging </p><p>sermons that were delivered against just </p><p>such sinners as himself. </p><p> Old man Polyte’s look was piteous. Then</p><p>it became dogged. </p><p> “Bien, Mon Pere,” he answered. “As be-</p><p>fore, you will find me as good as my word.” </p><p>A LITTLE later, after the ringing </p><p>of the second bell, Pere Martain </p><p>stood watching as the last of the </p><p>congregation entered his church. Beside </p><p>him Prejean, the baker, held forth upon the </p><p>all-absorbing event of the day before. </p><p> “It is incredible, Mon Pere” ran on</p><p>Prejean. “Of course nothing will be done </p><p>since the Varos were fugitives, and began </p><p>the affair themselves. It was all seen by </p><p>those upon Lartigue’s boat. But consider </p><p>Polyte. Here he has destroyed three </p><p>brothers—two of them with a saint.” </p><p> This time Pere Martain permitted his</p><p>smile. </p><p> “It was not a saint, Prejean,” he replied.</p><p>“I myself took the image to Mouton, where </p><p>Monsieur Decourt recognized it and ex- </p><p>plained. It is what you call a Billi—a </p><p>Billi.—But I can not remember the name. </p><p>I can only tell you that it is a toy, the pos- </p><p>session of which is supposed to bring good </p><p>luck.” </p><p> “Just the same, we all thought it a saint,</p><p>Polyte the most of all,” persisted Prejean. </p><p> Pere Martain’s tone became patient.</p><p> “My friend,” said he, “the workings of</p><p>Providence are beyond us, but of one thing</p><p>we may be sure. Always they result in </p><p>good. Use your eyes, and you will see.” </p><p> By now the last stragglers had entered the</p><p>church, all save one. This straggler, tall, </p><p>ancient, and weatherbeaten, moved gin- </p><p>gerly forward, treading the worn wooden </p><p>steps as if they were a ladder of swords. </p><p>Upon the church porch he hesitated, half- </p><p>turning as though for a backward look </p><p>across the square. Then, with a sudden </p><p>desperate twist, he lurched inside. </p><p> There was no famous exhorter, no mon-</p><p>strous tabernacle, no vast choir of a thou- </p><p>sand singers. Only the fragile priest, the </p><p>tiny church, the few, untrained voices. </p><p> Nevertheless old man Polyte had hit the</p><p>trail. </p><p> ! 3</p><p> L-</p><p>A PREVARICATED PARADE </p><p>ly ’W’. C .Tuttle </p><p>Author of "Clean Crazy,” “Monkeying with Ancestorsetc. </p><p>“i - iND for the support of this </p><p>A declaration, with a firm reliance </p><p>I*. on the protection of Divine </p><p>_____I Providence, we mutually pledge </p><p>to each other our lives, our fortunes and our </p><p>sacred honor.” </p><p>’ Hank Padden shifted his seat on the top </p><p>pole of the corral, and marks the place with </p><p>his finger. </p><p> “Now,” says he, “shall I orate the names</p><p>of the men who signed it?” </p><p> “Never mind,” replies old man Whit-</p><p>taker. “We don’t know none of them, per- </p><p>sonally, so we’ll let what you’ve already </p><p>read be sufficient and plenty. After listen- </p><p>ing to all you’ve read out of that book, </p><p>Hank, I’m of the impression that she’s a </p><p>fitting day to be celebrated. What do you </p><p>think, Hen?” </p><p> “She’s worth a passing memorial,” says I,</p><p>and “Scenery” Sims, the fourth member of </p><p>our committee, nods his head: </p><p> “She sure is, gents. I never cared for</p><p>kings, except in jack-pots, and our glorious </p><p>forefathers sure did proclaim their feelings. </p><p>I’m with yuh from the hondo to the saddle- </p><p>horn.” </p><p> That makes it unanimous. The night</p><p>before there’s a meeting in Paradise, and </p><p>they appoints me and Scenery, Hank Pad- </p><p>den and old man Whittaker as a committee </p><p>to investigate the reasons and so forth of the </p><p>Fourth of July, and whether, in our own </p><p>minds, she’s of sufficient import to consider </p><p>a celebration. </p><p>We finds that she is. Hank Padden reads </p><p>us the reasons out of a dictionary, while </p><p>we sets there on the corral top, at the </p><p>Cross J. </p><p> Old man W7hittaker owns the Cross J,</p><p>Hank Padden the Seven A, and Scenery </p><p>Sims is the possessor of the Circle S outfit </p><p>and the squeakiest voice ever anchored in </p><p>the throat of a human being. Every time I</p><p>hears Scenery start to talk I pray for cyl- </p><p>inder oil or chloroform. Me? I’m Henry </p><p>Clay Peck. I work for old man Whittaker. </p><p>I ain’t got nothing but a conscience, a heap </p><p>of respect for the truth and the feeling that I </p><p>lowers myself when I punches cows. </p><p> We has just arrived at our conclusion</p><p>when “Muley” Bowles saunters down to the </p><p>corral, climbs up beside us and bends our </p><p>seat all to pieces. We four moves to the </p><p>next section for safety. Muley weighs so </p><p>much that he has to bandage his bronc’s </p><p>legs with splints to keep it from being bow- </p><p>legged. The world lost a cracking good </p><p>poet when Muley essayed to punch cows. </p><p>He don’t look the part, not having soulful </p><p>eyes nor emaciated ribs, but when it comes </p><p>to making up poetry he’s got ’em all lashed </p><p>to the snubbing-post. </p><p> “Has the committee arrived at a satisfac-</p><p>tory conclusion?” he asks, puffing hard on </p><p>his cigaret, and shaking out a new rope. </p><p> “When the facts is made public we’ll let</p><p>yuh know with the rest,” squeaks Scenery, </p><p>who dislikes Muley a heap. </p><p> “Who’s talking to you?” demands Muley.</p><p>“Scenery, you takes too much upon your- </p><p>self. I been thinking of a sweet little rhyme </p><p>154 </p><p>A Prevaricated Parade </p><p>155 </p><p>what sounds like this, and I gives yuh three </p><p>guesses who I mean: </p><p> “He had a squeaky little voice,</p><p> A skinny little frame.</p><p> He lived in God's own country,</p><p> But the country wa’n’t to blame.</p><p> Comparing him with growed-up men,</p><p> Who rode the Sawtooth Hills,</p><p> He looked like a pewter nickel</p><p> In a bunch of green-back bills.”</p><p> “Yah-h-h-h!” shrills Scenery. “You’re</p><p>sore ’cause you wasn’t elected to the com- </p><p>mittee. Lard!” </p><p> Scenery puts all the venom in his system</p><p>into that last word, and at the finish his </p><p>voice would have split a cigaret paper. As </p><p>he makes his greasy statement his right </p><p>boot snaps up to horizontal, and Muley’s </p><p>loop gets him around the ankle. </p><p> It sure was one beautiful and speedy piece</p><p>of rope work, and the next minute Scenery </p><p>is on his shoulders in the corral, with his </p><p>right foot snubbed high and handsome to </p><p>the top of a corral post. </p><p> Muley lights his cigaret and climbs down</p><p>the other side. </p><p> “The committee will have to turn him</p><p>loose,” he states. “I won’t pollute my </p><p>hands by touching him. I reckon the acid </p><p>in his measly little carcass will ruin that </p><p>metal hondo before he gets loose, but it’s </p><p>worth it.” </p><p> Muley peers through the poles of the cor-</p><p>ral and grins at Scenery. </p><p> “Next time yuh opines to speak of a by-</p><p>product of your family, Scenery, don’t look </p><p>at me,” he states. </p><p> Our nerves are rasped considerable before</p><p>we gets Scenery calmed down, but we finally </p><p>pacifies him, and all sets in judgment on the</p><p>Fourth of July again. </p><p> “Now that we’ve decided to celebrate—</p><p>how’ll we do it?” asks Hank. “She ought </p><p>to be did befitting the solemnity of the occa- </p><p>sion,^hadn’t it, Whittaker?” </p><p> “She deserves it,” agrees the old man.</p><p>“We’ll have a salute at sunrise, won’t we? </p><p>Then what’ll we do?” </p><p> “We got to have a pe-rade,” squeaks</p><p>Scenery. “Them is necessary adjunct to </p><p>celebrations. I was down to Cottonwood </p><p>last Fourth, and they sure had a humdinger </p><p>of a pe-rade. Had a feller all dressed up in </p><p>a fancy hat and a sash, riding in front, and </p><p>then comes a lot of dress-up wagons, what </p><p>they designates as floats. They has a </p><p>beautiful gal all dressed up to imitate Miss </p><p>Columbus, and-” </p><p> “Who’s she?” asks Hank.</p><p> “Don’t you know who Columbus was?”</p><p>asked Scenery, and Hank nods. </p><p> “Well, don’t ask fool questions then,”</p><p>squeaks Scenery. “They has hoss-races, </p><p>foot-races and-” </p><p> “They didn’t have nothing that we can’t</p><p>have,” pronounces Hank. </p><p> “We can have all that. I’ll ride at the</p><p>head of the pe-rade and-” </p><p> “That ain’t unanimous,” interrupts Sce-</p><p>nery. “Why you any more than me, Hank? </p><p>Next thing we know you’ll want to be Miss </p><p>Columbus.” </p><p> “Hang on to yourselves,” advises Whit-</p><p>taker. “You fellers elects yourselves to </p><p>everything—seems to me. A leading man </p><p>in a pe-rade ought to dress the part, I </p><p>reckon. When I lives in Great Falls I’m </p><p>elected as a ornery member of a organiza- </p><p>tion. It had something to do about wood- </p><p>craft, and we dresses up like a plush hoss, </p><p>when we meets. I still got my war-bonnet </p><p>and pants left. Some son of a gun stole </p><p>the coat. I still got my ax, too.” </p><p> “You still got the ax?” squeaks Scenery.</p><p>“Wonderful! Go home and cut some wood.</p><p>I think your fire’s out.” </p><p> “While you old spavs are fighting for</p><p>honors, what’s the matter with considering </p><p>me?” I asks. “You’re all so danged old </p><p>and stove-up that you’d have to lead it in a </p><p>lumber-wagon. Look at me, and step back </p><p>in the ranks. I’m young, handsome-” </p><p> “Pause!” yelps Scenery. “Pause, Hen.</p><p>It takes brains to lead a pe-rade.” </p><p> “Then let’s not quarrel,” says I. “We</p><p>ain’t elegible. Let’s settle these little de- </p><p>tails later and in a place what ain’t so dry. </p><p>It won’t be the Fourth of July until day </p><p>after tomorrow, so let’s adjourn.” </p><p>THEY AGREES. Scenery and </p><p>Hank goes home, and I goes up to </p><p>the bunk-house, where “Telescope” </p><p>Tolliver and Muley are playing pitch. </p><p> “Hen, what has the committee decided</p><p>to do?” askes Telescope. </p><p> I tells him what our plans are, so far, and</p><p>while I’m telling in comes “Chuck” Warner, </p><p>the prize liar of Yaller Rock County. </p><p>Chuck punches cows with us for a living, </p><p>and carries the greatest assortment of pre- </p><p>varications on earth as a side-line. I been </p><p>with him so long that at times I shades tiie </p><p>truth a little, too. </p><p> “They can’t all lead the pe-rade, that’s a</p><p>Adventure </p><p>cinch,” states Chuck. “I seen a pe-rade </p><p>down to New York one time that-” </p><p> “You never was in New York,” states</p><p>Telescope. </p><p> “I was born there,” declares Chuck,</p><p>wiggling his ears. </p><p> “In Pima County, Arizona,” says Tele-</p><p>scope. “I know when, too, Chuck.” </p><p>“Dates don’t count, Telescope. I said I </p><p>was born in New York, and it’s my business </p><p>if I wants to stick to my statement. Now, </p><p>Telescope, if you said you was born in a </p><p>teepee on a Digger reservation I wouldn’t </p><p>argue with you for a minute. I’d take it as </p><p>Gospel. A feller has a right to a birthplace, </p><p>and I takes New York.” </p><p> That argument shows Chuck Warner in</p><p>his native state. He’s got a face like a </p><p>bronc, shortest legs’on earth, and can wiggle </p><p>his ears like a burro. The only time he </p><p>can’t look yuh square in the eye is when he’s </p><p>telling the truth. </p><p> “Yuh ought to get somebody with a little</p><p>style to lead that pe-rade, Hen,” opines </p><p>Muley. </p><p> “Might get ‘Pole Cat’ Perkins or ‘Hare-</p><p>lip’ Hansen,” laughs Telescope. “Have </p><p>Harelip ride one of his goats, and have Pole </p><p>Cat walk slow behind him, leading a skunk. </p><p>Have the goat wear the old man’s striped </p><p>pants, and put Scenery’s hat on the skunk.” </p><p>“You fellers ought to be on the com- </p><p>mittee,” says I, sarcastic-like. “Yuh might </p><p>get up your own pe-rade.” </p><p> “That’s a good scheme,” agrees Chuck.</p><p>“We’ll form a offensive and defensive </p><p>alliance.” </p><p> “Offensive is right,” says I, and then I</p><p>goes up to see the old man. </p><p> The next morning me and the old man</p><p>goes to Paradise, and goes into executive </p><p>session, with Scenery and Hank, in the rear </p><p>of Dug Chaffin’s saloon. Hank pounds on </p><p>the table with his boot heel, and calls the </p><p>roll. We’re all present. </p><p> “Gents,” asks Hank, “who is going to</p><p>lead the pe-rade?” </p><p> We looks at each other, and then the old</p><p>man clears his throat. </p><p> “I looked up them lodge raiment, and</p><p>they’re dazzlers.” </p><p> “I still got that hard hat that I wore to a</p><p>Dimmicrat rally down to Silver Bend ten </p><p>year ago,” orates Scenery. “She looks a </p><p>heap dignified, and it’s too small for any of </p><p>you fellers. I got a sword, too—in a </p><p>holster.” </p><p> “To lead a pe-rade a man ought to</p><p>look dignified—not his clothes,” proclaims </p><p>Hank. </p><p> “This here glory thing is going to cause</p><p>hard feelings,” says I. “I moves that we </p><p>does like this: we’ll all be here before the </p><p>pe-rade is ready to start, and we’ll let some </p><p>uninterested party pick out the suitable per- </p><p>son for to lead it. Dress for the part, and </p><p>if yuh don’t get picked, be a good sport and </p><p>pe-rade anyway.” </p><p> “That’ll keep the mortality down to a</p><p>certain extent,” agrees Hank, and the other </p><p>two nods. </p><p> “Now,” says Hank, “how about this per-</p><p>son to be Miss Columbus?” </p><p> “I got her picked,” states Scenery. “I</p><p>nominates Miss Eulalie McFee.” </p><p> “Sheriff’s daugher, eh?” laughs Hank.</p><p>“She’s so danged thin that if she stood edge- </p><p>ways yuh couldn’t see her, Scenery. I </p><p>nominates Miss Maggie Smith, niece of </p><p>‘Doughgod’ Smith. Who seconds the mo- </p><p>tion?” </p><p> “Miss Columbus ought to be a danged</p><p>sight better-looking than Maggie Smith,” </p><p>states the old man. “Who ever heard of </p><p>Miss Columbus with crossed eyes and </p><p>freckles? I marks X at the top of my </p><p>ticket for Miss Clarice Chaffin, daughter of </p><p>Dug. Do I hear an agreeable voice?” </p><p>“Haw! Haw!” roars Hank. “Clarice </p><p>Chaffin! . This contest ain’t for no animated </p><p>flag-pole, Whittaker. How’s your senti- </p><p>ments, Hen?” </p><p> “I leans toward Mrs. Genevieve Saun-</p><p>ders, widder of the late ‘Slim’ Saunders. </p><p>She’d fill the part.” </p><p> “It would be danged small if she didn’t,”</p><p>Scenery. “She weighs at least two hun- </p><p>dred and-” </p><p> “Scenery,” says I, “some day I’m going</p><p>to hang a pebble on your neck, throw yuh </p><p>into a tin cup of water and drown yuh.” </p><p>“Let’s vote on it,” suggests Hank. </p><p> “It don’t require no vote,” replies Whit-</p><p>taker. “If Hen wants to drown Scenery </p><p>I’m-” </p><p> “I mean vote on the lady!” snaps Hank.</p><p>We did. We each cast a vote for our </p><p>choice, and it starts a argument that’s a </p><p>humdinger, and before we leaves the coun- </p><p>cil-chamber we’re mentally wallering in </p><p>each other’s gore. </p><p> Paradise is busy fixing up floats and dec-</p><p>orations, and we’re asked a lot of questions </p><p>that we don’t dare to answer. </p><p>A Prevaricated Parade </p><p>157 </p><p> “Who is going to lead the pe-rade?”</p><p>whispers Doughgod to me, and I whispers </p><p>back.— </p><p> “I am.”</p><p> He follers me for a distance, and whispers</p><p>once more— </p><p> “Hen, who is going to be Miss Colum-</p><p>bus?” I answers— </p><p> “The widder Saunders.”</p><p> “Hank told me that my niece, Maggie</p><p>was going to be her.” </p><p> “Hank’s a liar,” says I, and Doughgod</p><p>nods, and walks away. </p><p> I’m over at the rack, cinching up my</p><p>saddle, when here comes Dug Chaffm. </p><p> “Henry, I’m looking for information that</p><p>I can’t seem to get from any of your co- </p><p>horts. Who is due to be Miss Columbus </p><p>tomorrow?” </p><p> “The widder Saunders. That’s settled,</p><p>Dug.” </p><p> “Do you know that old man Whittaker</p><p>is a liar?” he asks, and I nods. “Yes, he’s </p><p>a liar,” declares Dug. “He said he’d </p><p>stick for Clarice ’till hell froze over.” </p><p> “He got cold feet,” says I, and Dug goes</p><p>back to his palace of sin, in a unhappy </p><p>mood. </p><p> I gets on my bronc and points toward</p><p>the Cross J. I’m sick of being on a com- </p><p>mittee, and having to hurt people’s feelings. </p><p>Paradise ain’t no safe place to cause discord </p><p>in. There’s a sentiment in that place that </p><p>leans towards shooting first and asking </p><p>questions afterwards. There’s only one </p><p>thing the whole place will agree on, and </p><p>that is this: yuh can’t have a royal flush if </p><p>your opponent lias four kings. </p><p> “Stuttering” Stevens thought he’d es-</p><p>tablish a precedent by holding one against </p><p>kings and sevens in one hand and kings and </p><p>eights in another. The coroner said that</p><p>either shot would have been fatal. Stut- </p><p>tering must a been guilty, ’cause no </p><p>man would steal kings to make up two </p><p>pair. </p><p> I hammers my bronc along down to</p><p>where the Cross J road forks with the one </p><p>from Silver Bend, when I hears a peculiar </p><p>noise. Sounds to me like a threshing </p><p>machine with St. Vitus dance. My bronc </p><p>shows signs of nervousness, so I gets off. </p><p>Pretty soon it comes in sight, and I recog- </p><p>nizes it as being an autymobile, the same of </p><p>which ain’t been in this country since the </p><p>one belonging to Scenery Sims runs over </p><p>some dynamite at Piperock and evaporates. </p><p>MY BRONC drags me off into the </p><p>mesquite for a ways, until I can </p><p>get my rope around a bush and </p><p>stop him, and then I pilgrims back to the </p><p>road. At first I don’t recognize the in- </p><p>habitant of that carriage. I looks him over, </p><p>careful-like, and then he grins and betrays </p><p>himself. It’s old “Calamity” Carson. I </p><p>ain’t seen him for five years, and I shakes </p><p>his hand industrious-like. After we gets </p><p>through pumping elbows I leans back and </p><p>surveys his equipage. </p><p> “Some vehicle, eh, Henry?” he says, with</p><p>a dusty grin. “Surprised to see me?” </p><p>“Well, not exactly, Calamity. We been </p><p>expecting yuh.” </p><p> “Expecting me?” he wonders aloud. “I</p><p>suppose ‘Tellurium’ had to go and tell </p><p>everybody.” </p><p> “Uh-huh,” I agrees. “Tellurium Woods</p><p>never could keep still.” </p><p> So far as I know Tellurium ain’t been in</p><p>Paradise for six months, but he’s as good as </p><p>anybody to blame it on. Him and Calam- </p><p>ity used to be pardners. </p><p> “Well, well!” says Calamity, brushing</p><p>the dust off his mustache, and giving his </p><p>cigaret a chance to burn hair freely. “Here </p><p>I been figuring on surprising the old-timers, </p><p>and I been told upon by a friend. Henry </p><p>Peck, I done sold out my property over in </p><p>the Little Rockies, and now I’m rich. </p><p> “I got more money than a dog has fleas,</p><p>but I ain’t enjoyed it none. I opines to </p><p>throw a surprise into Paradise, so I buys</p><p>this gasoline buckboard, has her shipped to </p><p>Silver Bend, and here I am. She’s worse </p><p>than any outlaw bronc that ever flinched </p><p>under a saddle, Henry, and I’m older by </p><p>years and years than I was a week ago when </p><p>a man teached me how to drive it. I don’t </p><p>know what makes her run. All I got to do </p><p>is put gasoline in her, twist her tail a few </p><p>times, pull the designated levers, and point </p><p>her away from the stumps. She sure makes </p><p>enough noise.” </p><p> “You figured the time right, Calamity,”</p><p>says I. “Paradise sure is doing itself </p><p>proud in your honor.” </p><p> “In my honor?” What’s the idea,</p><p>Henry?” </p><p> “Well, yuh see it ain’t often that a town</p><p>can have a former inhabitant come home </p><p>rich and distinguished like you are. The </p><p>public sure admires a man with a chunk off </p><p>the root of all evil, Calamity. We’ve dec- </p><p>orated in your honor, and tomorrow we </p><p>Adventure </p><p>parades before yuh to show our admiration </p><p>and respect. Sabe?” </p><p> “My gosh, Henry!” he snorts. “This is</p><p>too much.” </p><p> “It’s considerable, Calamity, but look</p><p>who you are.” </p><p> “That’s a fact, Henry—it sure is. Well,</p><p>well!” </p><p> He sets there, with a far-away look in his</p><p>eyes, and that cigaret sizzling on his mus- </p><p>tache, and sudden-like he reaches under the </p><p>seat and hauls out a jug. </p><p> “Henry Peck, I been saving this for my</p><p>old friends—Tellurium, Doughgod, ‘Half </p><p>Mike’ Smith, et cettry, but you qualifies, </p><p>Henry. Your oration sure puts joy into </p><p>my old heart. Go as deep as yuh Uke.” </p><p> I sets there in his gas go-devil, and we</p><p>swears allegiance to each other. We cele- </p><p>brates our new-found friendship, and re- </p><p>gales each other with anecdotes. I tells </p><p>him all the neighborhood gossip, and we </p><p>toast each and every one. He tells me </p><p>about his property in the Little Rockies, </p><p>and we drinks a toast to all the little </p><p>rocks. </p><p> My bronc gets the rope loose, and passes</p><p>us on his way home. We toasts the Cross J </p><p>and my pinto. </p><p> “Who did yuh say was going to lead the</p><p>pe-rade in my honor?” asks Calamity. </p><p> “I am. Being your best friend, Calam-</p><p>ity, I’m elegible. I’ll ride that pinto bronc </p><p>at the head end of that great conglomera- </p><p>tion. How’d yuh like that, old-timer?” </p><p> “I got a better idea,” says he, solemn-</p><p>like. “I’ll teach yuh how to run this here, </p><p>contraption, and you lead her in this. </p><p>How’d yuh like to do that, Henry?” </p><p> “Sounds to me like the voice of angels.</p><p>What yuh packing in them two cans in the </p><p>rear?” </p><p> “Gasoline. Twenty gallons I shipped</p><p>with the car. All yuh got to do is to twist </p><p>that front crank until she starts humming.</p><p>Sabe? Then yuh get in and let this here </p><p>brake loose. You get out and give her a </p><p>twist, Henry. That’s the first lesson.” </p><p> I falls out and ambles around to the</p><p>front. I grasps the crank in both hands, </p><p>gives it a man-sized yank, slips with both </p><p>feet, and that juggernaut runs right across </p><p>my floating ribs. She sure squashes me a </p><p>plenty, and 1 don’t more than start to get </p><p>up when here she comes right back to run </p><p>over me again. Calamity stops her just in </p><p>time. </p><p> “You forgot the e-mergency,” observes</p><p>Calamity, scared-like, over the back of the </p><p>seat. </p><p> “Maybe,” says I. “I forgot my name</p><p>and address, too, if that’s anything to snort </p><p>over. What are yuh supposed to do—put </p><p>her against a rock to start her?” </p><p> “It’s a simple thing, Hen.”</p><p> “Yes, so is a stick uh dynamite,” says I,</p><p>rubbing the kinks out of my hide. “Let’s </p><p>not call school right now, Calamity. We’ll </p><p>go up to the Cross J, where prying eyes can </p><p>see us not, and there yuh can show me all </p><p>things. Anyway yuh don’t want to show </p><p>up in Paradise today. Everybody is busy </p><p>getting things ready, and if you was to go </p><p>down there now they’d drop everything. </p><p>Sabe?” </p><p> “Popularity warmeth my cold heart,” says</p><p>he. “Being of the committee, Henry </p><p>Peck, I bows to superior wisdom. We’ll </p><p>proceed to the old Cross J, and take a </p><p>lesson.” </p><p> We stops at the Seeping Springs and has a</p><p>nice drink—out of the jug. We starts out </p><p>merrily along the road, when all to once </p><p>Calamity starts to tell me a story. Calam- </p><p>ity must have French blood in his carcass, </p><p>’cause he talks with his hands. </p><p> At least he might a picked out a flat</p><p>place to do his gestures in, but as it was we </p><p>hops off the road, down a hill, and pokes </p><p>the front end of that machine into a mes- </p><p>quite bush. What part of it didn’t plow </p><p>through the bush jumped over. </p><p> I untangles myself from the brush and</p><p>wanders over to the wagon. She don’t</p><p>seem hurt much, but her heart has quit </p><p>beating. </p><p> “Hyas cultus chuck, chick,” states a voice,</p><p>and I turns to see old Running Wolf, a </p><p>Piegan, squatting on his haunches, looking </p><p>at that machine. </p><p> He’s got a look on his face that Colum-</p><p>bus might a had when he first saw the </p><p>shores of our fair country. </p><p> “What did he say?” asks a weak voice,</p><p>and Calamity appears from the other side of </p><p>the car. </p><p> “He said, ‘It’s a mighty bad wagon,’ ”</p><p>I interprets, and Calamity nods his head: </p><p> “That Injun ain’t no danged idiot,</p><p>Henry. Wonder if he’d like to take a </p><p>ride?” </p><p> “Mesika klataiva kopa chick, chick}” I</p><p>asks, but the old redskin puts his thumb up </p><p>to his nose and wiggles his fingers at us. </p><p>A Prevaricated Parade </p><p>159 </p><p> “Nah-h-h-h-h!” he gargles, and points at</p><p> his moccasins.</p><p> We manages to get that wagon back on</p><p> the road. We drinks a toast to our good</p><p> luck and to honest and cautious Injuns, and</p><p> plods on up to the Cross J. I reckon our</p><p> toasts covers too much territory, ’cause</p><p> when Calamity opines to have me read his</p><p> book of rules, all I can do is sing.</p><p> IT’S ALMOST dark when I wakes</p><p> up. Beside me on the bunk is</p><p> Calamity, snoring like a shepherd,</p><p> so I sticks my boot into his ribs.</p><p> “Thanks,” says he, after a look around.</p><p> “Thanks, Henry. I was having a autymo-</p><p> bilemare.”</p><p> Just then in comes old man Whittaker.</p><p> He looks around, sort of mad-like, and</p><p> glares at me and Calamity.</p><p> “They don’t seem to be here—gol dingle</p><p> dangle it!” he yelps.</p><p> Me and Calamity looks around and</p><p> shakes our heads.</p><p> “No,” says I. “They must a left.”</p><p> “They never went alone!” he howls.</p><p> “That fancy, lodge war-bonnet and them</p><p> striped pants never went away alone. I</p><p> reckon I got to kill somebody!”</p><p> He slams the door, as he goes out, and</p><p> Calamity looks at me.</p><p> “What’s the matter with him?” he asks.</p><p> - “He never recognized me, and I’ve knowed</p><p> Whittaker for years and years.”</p><p> “Crazy,” says I. “He went crazy over</p><p> fancy clothes. He don’t know anybody</p><p> any more, Calamity.”</p><p> “Pshaw! I knowed he wasn’t-’’</p><p> We hears a voice at the door, and I yells,</p><p> “Come in!” and in ambles Pole Cat Perk-</p><p> ins. He’s got a bundle under his arm, and</p><p> he sets down on the bunk and grins at me</p><p> and Calamity.</p><p> “Huh-Hen, I’m after your permission,”</p><p> says he.</p><p> “You’ve got it, Pole Cat. What yuh</p><p> going to do with it?”</p><p> He unrolls that bundle and produces a</p><p> valler stove-pipe hat, dented and moth-</p><p> eaten, and an old rusty sword. He bal-</p><p> ances that old hat on his ball-shaped head,</p><p> and runs the sword along the palm of his left</p><p> hand.</p><p> “Do I qualify, Mister Peck?” he asks.</p><p> “For certain places, Pole Cat. What’s</p><p> the idea?”</p><p> “Chuck gives me these habiliments and</p><p>tells me that I’ll have to get your permis- </p><p>sion to lead the pe-rade tomorrow. I ad- </p><p>mires the chance so much that 1 ain’t lost </p><p>no time in coming. Do I get it?” </p><p> “Pole Cat,” says I, solemn-like, “you</p><p>probably will. Let your judgment be your </p><p>guiding star.” </p><p> “Thanks, Henry. I bids yuh good after-</p><p>noon.” </p><p> “Better make it farewell,” says I.</p><p> “Loco crop must be flourishing up here,”</p><p>observes Calamity. “Some smells worse </p><p>than others, Henry.” </p><p> “This one is named after his associates,”</p><p>says I, and just then somebody rides up to </p><p>the door and I hears Harelip Hansen’s voice. </p><p>“Get behind the bunk!” I hisses at Calam- </p><p>ity. “If Harelip sees you up here he never </p><p>will leave.” </p><p> “Howdy, Henry,” says Harelip. “I’m</p><p>glad to see yuh.” </p><p> “I’m pleased to know that the sight of me</p><p>makes folks glad,” says I. “What yuh got </p><p>on your mind and under your arm?” </p><p> He unrolls enough for me to see that he’s</p><p>got Whit taker’s lodge clothes. </p><p> “Chuck told me I could wear these at the</p><p>front end of that pe-rade tomorrow, but I’d </p><p>have to see you first.” </p><p> “What do yuh reckon to have me do—</p><p>dress yuh?” I asks, and he grins all over his </p><p>homely face. </p><p> “It’ll be all right, will it?” he asks, and I</p><p>nods and replies: </p><p> “You know best, Harelip. There’s a</p><p>divinity that shapes our ends.” </p><p> “Uh-huh. I gives you thanks, Henry.”</p><p>“I’ll take ’em, Harelip,” says I. “1 may </p><p>never have any use for them, but it will be </p><p>something to remember yuh by, old trailer.” </p><p>I watches him climb on his flea-bitten </p><p>cayuse, and jog off down the road. Calam- </p><p>ity is looking over my shoulder, and as </p><p>Harelip drifts out of sight he yelps: </p><p> “Where’s my aulymobile, Henry? We</p><p>left her right out there didn’t we?” </p><p> We goes out and looks around. There’s</p><p>the tracks we made when we came in, and </p><p>there’s the tracks where it went out, and </p><p>back down the road. Calamity scratches </p><p>his head, and hitches up his pants. </p><p> “Henry,” says he, “I’m sorry. What</p><p>yuh going to lead that pe-rade in now?” </p><p> I simply shakes my head, and says to</p><p>myself: </p><p> “That’s going to be a wrcll-led pe-rade.</p><p>She’s already got two front ends.” </p><p>i6o </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Henry,” says Calamity, pointing at the</p><p>dust, “they just missed that gate-post as </p><p>they goes out and they didn’t get on to the </p><p>road for a hundred yards. I’d opine that </p><p>they ain’t familiar with the thing.” </p><p> “Was there anything left under the seat?”</p><p>I asks. </p><p> “One two-gallon jug, Henry—and what</p><p>was left in ours.” </p><p> “There is much to look forward to, Ca-</p><p>lamity,” says I. “Maybe we better take a </p><p>shovel along. I hope they don’t bust up </p><p>your machine.” </p><p> “Don’t let that molest your heart strings,</p><p>Henry. I been thinking for several days </p><p>thay maybe she’s going to be a fatal fad. </p><p>Of course it’s going to spoil my entry into </p><p>Paradise. A person of my financial stand- </p><p>ing hadn’t ought to enter his old home </p><p>town except in a fitting equipage. Ain’t I </p><p>right, Henry?” </p><p> “Well,” says I, “since the old man left</p><p>with his buckskin team and rattle wagon, </p><p>and some heartless hombre has turned loose </p><p>every bronc on the place, there ain’t no </p><p>mode of locomotion in sight except them </p><p>two burros up there at the cook-shack. </p><p>Are yuh too proud to straddle a jackass, </p><p>Calamity?’ </p><p> “1 t’ll soon be dark, Henry. Many a man</p><p>has done tilings in the dark that he wouldn’t </p><p>do in the light. Let’s equip the shameful </p><p>things and be on our way.” </p><p> We puts saddles on them long-eared</p><p>things and pilgrims off down the road in the </p><p>dusty dusk. When we comes opposite the </p><p>Saunders place, I pulls up. </p><p> “Whow,” says I. “I got a mission to per-</p><p>form. We got to have a Miss Columbus </p><p>for your pe-rade, Calamity, and I got to </p><p>bear her the news.” </p><p> We goes up and knocks on her door, and</p><p>informs her of the fact. </p><p> “My gosh, Henry!” says she. “I ain’t</p><p>got nothing to wear!”</p><p> “Ma’am,” says Calamity, bowing low,</p><p>“don’t you let that worry yuh. A figure </p><p>like yours don’t need no clothes.” </p><p> The door shuts off the conversation, and</p><p>we wanders back to our trusty steeds. </p><p> “Calamity, you been a lot of help to me</p><p>this evening,” says I. “You sure cut our </p><p>cinch with the widder Saunders.” </p><p> “I'm prostrated with grief,” orates the old</p><p>pelican. “Anyway I don’t see what Co- </p><p>lumbus has to do with my home-coming, </p><p>Henry.” </p><p> “I can’t explain it to yuh, Calamity.</p><p>You’d have to see it for yourself.” </p><p> We pilgrims down to Paradise, and ties</p><p>our steeds on a side street. There’s a </p><p>scarcity of rolling stock in sight, and it </p><p>makes me wonder a heap. Usually yuh </p><p>can see broncs tied all over town, when a </p><p>celebration is in prospect. </p><p> We pokes along up the street to Mike</p><p>Pelly’s saloon and goes inside. Mike is </p><p>alone in there, setting at the end of the bar, </p><p>with a shotgun beside him. </p><p> “What’s the matter with Paradise?” I</p><p>asks. </p><p> “Civilization,” says Mike.</p><p> “Are we welcome?” asks Calamity, ta-</p><p>king in the attitude of Mike, and sizing up </p><p>the place. </p><p> “You are,” replies Mike. “This place is</p><p>neutral. I’d advise you to get out of line </p><p>with that window. The town is divided </p><p>against itself.” </p><p> “What causes the divisions?” I asks, ta-</p><p>king Mike’s advice. </p><p> Mike bites off a fresh chew and settles</p><p>back in his chair. </p><p> “NUMEROUS and sundry tilings,</p><p>Henry. Old man Whittaker is set- </p><p>-c—1 ting up there in Henderson’s bar- </p><p>bershop, with a Winchester, swearing he’s </p><p>going to perforate Harelip Hansen, who is </p><p>across the street in Dug Chaffin’s corral,</p><p>nursing a peeled nose and a six-shooter. </p><p>The old man swears that Harelip stole his </p><p>clothes. </p><p> “Pole Cat Perkins is behind my place</p><p>here, trying to jam some lead into Scenery </p><p>Sims before Scenery can slip some to him. </p><p>It seems that their trouble grows out of a </p><p>clothes controversy, too. Pole Cat avers </p><p>that he’s going to slit Scenery with a rusty </p><p>sword. </p><p> “Doughgod Smith seems to be seeking</p><p>Hank Padden’s gore over something about </p><p>Columbus’ daughter, and Dug Chaffin’s got </p><p>the same thing against old man Whittaker </p><p>and orates his intentions of puncturing the </p><p>old man’s hide for prevarication. Bill </p><p>McFee refuses to arrest anybody except </p><p>Scenery Sims, and his feelings seem some </p><p>rasped over this same Columbus thing. </p><p>Who in-is Miss Columbus, Henry?” </p><p> “I don’t know.”</p><p> “You don’t, eh?” laughs Mike. “The</p><p>-yuh don’t! You sure ought to, Henry. </p><p>Yuh sent notes to both of the Mudgett </p><p>A Prevaricated Parade </p><p>161 </p><p>sisters, to Hulda Peterson, cook at the Tri- </p><p>angle, Annie Schmidt, at the Seven A, and </p><p>to Mrs. “Breezy” Benson, asking ’em to fill </p><p>the part. Every one of them has been </p><p>down here looking for you today. Accord- </p><p>ing to what I can find out there can’t more </p><p>than one be it, and that seems to cause a </p><p>heap of dissatisfaction, Henry. Abe Mud- </p><p>gett and Breezy was here today, and they </p><p>are wishful to see yuh.” </p><p> “Henry,” says Calamity, “you’ve over-</p><p>done your duty.” </p><p> “It would look thataway to a innocent</p><p>bystander,” I agrees. “Where’s all the </p><p>broncs, Mike? Did everybody walk in </p><p>today?” </p><p> “That’s where the civilization part comes</p><p>in. A autymobile invades our fair city </p><p>today, and she swept us clean of hossflesh. </p><p>Out on them racks is fifteen pieces of rope </p><p>flopping in the breeze. Old man Whit- </p><p>taker’s buckskin team was in the lead the last </p><p>we seen of the race. That’s why nobody is </p><p>leaving. They’d rather be shot at than </p><p>walk.” </p><p> “Who had the autymobile?” asks Ca-</p><p>lamity. </p><p> “Nobody knows. It went too fast for us</p><p>to see.” </p><p> “Hoo, hoo!” comes a voice from outside,</p><p>and we all ducks. “Hoo, hoo!” she comes </p><p>again, and then we hears a female voice, </p><p>“Is Mister Peck in there?” </p><p> “Go out and see who it is,” I whispers to</p><p>Mike, but he shakes his head: </p><p> “Not me. She wants you, Henry.”</p><p> “She can take it out in wanting. I don’t</p><p>take no chances. You go out, Calamity. </p><p>Nobody’s got a thing against you.” </p><p>Calamity thinks it over, and then goes out </p><p>all humped like he was suffering from kidney </p><p>disease. Me and Mike lays low, and pretty </p><p>soon Calamity comes sneaking back. </p><p> “It was that female person we went up to</p><p>see,” he states. “She wishes to forgive me,</p><p>and wants me to tell you that she’ll take up </p><p>your offer, Henry. She’ll be Miss Co- </p><p>lumbus.” </p><p> “Another victim,” grunts Mike. “You’re</p><p>a bigger liar than Chuck Warner.” </p><p> “He done it for me,” defends Calamity.</p><p>“Henry wanted to make my homecoming a </p><p>complete success, and it ain’t all his fault if </p><p>it don’t exactly work out. When a man </p><p>has a pe-rade given in his honor he can’t </p><p>kick if some of the details do get a little </p><p>balled up.” </p><p>11 </p><p> “In your honor?” wonders Mike, out loud.</p><p>“Are you Fourth of July, Mister?” </p><p> “Fourth of July?” Calamity looks at</p><p>me and Mike, and then seems to dig deep- </p><p>like into his memory for buried information. </p><p> While he seems to check off some num-</p><p>bers on his fingers, I edges toward the back </p><p>door. He nods, sort of agreeable-like, </p><p>chaws one side of his mustache, and fingers </p><p>his waistline, where his gun makes a bulge. </p><p>“Fourth of July,” he mutters. “Uh-huh. </p><p>That’s right. Henry Peck told me-” </p><p> I opens the door, easy-like, and misses the</p><p>rest of the complaint. </p><p> “Now,” says I to me, “you’re branded as</p><p>a liar, Henry Peck. The best thing you can </p><p>do is to get your little jackass and go home. </p><p>Your forefathers never fought for glorious </p><p>freedom, so there ain’t no use of you cele- </p><p>brating the happy event. The men who </p><p>were responsible for the Pecks’ family tree </p><p>was all hung for lying and stealing long be- </p><p>fore the Declaration of Independence was </p><p>signed.” </p><p> With these few cheering words ringing in</p><p>my windpipe I ambles around the corner, </p><p>and down to where we left them burros. I </p><p>gets there just in time. Scenery Sims is </p><p>untying one of my trusty animiles, so I </p><p>quickens my pace and shoves a gun in his </p><p>ribs. </p><p> “Unhand that charger!” I roars in his ear,</p><p>and Scenery wilts against the hitchrack. </p><p>“You danged burro thief!” I hisses. "If</p><p>you wants to lead that pe-rade—go get </p><p>your own rolling stock.” </p><p> “I—I—I dud-don’t want to le-lead noth-</p><p>ing but the sus-simple life,” he stutters. “I </p><p>want to go home, Henry. Pup-Pole Cat </p><p>shot the back out of my suspenders, and </p><p>stuck a bullet into the cylinder of my gun </p><p>so she won’t work. I’m through, Hen. </p><p>You lead it.” </p><p> Here comes somebody down the street</p><p>toward us, puffing like a bronc with the </p><p>heaves. He lopes up to us, sticks his heels </p><p>into the ground and skids around to the op- </p><p>posite side of the burros. It is old man </p><p>Whittaker. </p><p> “Quick!” he pants. “I’m rushed to</p><p>death.” </p><p>Then he begins to fuss with a tie rope. </p><p>“Is speed essential?” I asks, and he </p><p>snorts. “You know it is! I’m out of shells </p><p>—got more at the ranch. Dang the man </p><p>what tied this rope!” </p><p> Just then somebody fires a shot up the</p><p>162 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>street and I don’t hesitate. I hops on to </p><p>that Rocky Mountain canary, sets my spurs </p><p>into his hide, and down the street we goes, </p><p>frog-hopping, high, wide and handsome. </p><p>A bullet plows under my steed, and he sails </p><p>out of Paradise faster than any burro ever </p><p>did before or since. </p><p> We keep up that speed for about a mile,</p><p>and then slows down to a amble. I know </p><p>where a pack-trail leaves the main road, a </p><p>mile or so above where the road does, so I </p><p>opines to take the shortest route to the </p><p>Cross J. I leads my animile, while I </p><p>searches for the trail in the dark, and all to </p><p>once 1 hears voices down the road. I hears </p><p>Muley’s bass and Chuck’s baritone, a cross </p><p>between a greaseless wheel and pneumonia, </p><p>raised in song— </p><p> “ ‘It was at Aunt Dinah’s quilting</p><p>partee-e-e-e-’ ” </p><p> Then Telescope’s tenor rings in—</p><p> “ ‘I was see-e-e-e-e-eing Nellie-e-e-e-e</p><p>home.’ ” </p><p> “Tha’s harmonee,” I hears Chuck opine.</p><p>“Le’s all shing ‘Holy City.’ ‘Lash night as I </p><p>lay shecping—shay, Teleschope, why don’t </p><p>this machine go on, eh?” </p><p> “How do I know,” replies Telescope.</p><p>“Shomebody light ’nother match so I can </p><p>read the reashon in the little book.” </p><p> “Aw, who cares?” asks Muley. “Let’s</p><p>have more cheer—listen: </p><p> ‘‘I love a little lager beer,</p><p> I love a little wine;</p><p> A little bit a alcohol</p><p> Makes my heart feel fine.</p><p> But when I want a reg’lar drink,</p><p> To make my feelings hug,</p><p> I take a little snifter</p><p> From the old brown jug.”</p><p> I sets there and listens to that kind of a</p><p>conversation for a while. They tries to sing </p><p>another song, but she don’t finish, and after </p><p>a while I wanders down and looks ’em over. </p><p>CHUCK is in the bottom of the </p><p>machine, with his boots hanging </p><p>over the dashboard, while Telescope </p><p>is doubled up in the seat, with his feet on </p><p>Chuck’s head. Muley is on the ground, </p><p>with his head through a space in a front </p><p>wheel, where some spokes are missing, and </p><p>he’s snoring by note. </p><p> I rolls him away from the machine. I</p><p>gives Telescope a gentle shove, hangs on to </p><p>his leg so he won’t hit too hard and deposits </p><p>him along with Muley. Chuck is wedged in </p><p>there pretty tight, and when I opines to </p><p>loosen him a little he orates something </p><p>about wanting his maw to wake him up, </p><p>’cause he’s going to be queen of the May. I </p><p>never did like to ride alone, so I lets him </p><p>stay. It pains me to see the flower of young </p><p>manhood in the gutter of alcohol thataway. </p><p>I finds the jug, and am glad to see that part </p><p>of it is still there. </p><p> I drinks what would measure about three</p><p>inches in a wash-tub, before I remembers </p><p>how Calamity runs that machine, but all to </p><p>once she comes back to me. I sets that </p><p>brake, gives her a mighty twist, and away </p><p>she goes, whirrup, whirrup, whirrup, zuz, </p><p>zuz, zuz, zuz. </p><p> I’ve rode a lot of broncs that didn’t sabe</p><p>the meaning of a bit, but that thing was less </p><p>bridlewise than anything I ever seen. We </p><p>grinds back toward Paradise, smelling of </p><p>burnt grease, gasoline and so forth. I takes </p><p>another look into that jug, and feels so ele- </p><p>vated that I puts my feet over the dash- </p><p>board. Somehow that seems to give the </p><p>critter more freedom, and we goes faster. </p><p> I gets so expert right away that I can</p><p>drive one-handed, and I discovers a little </p><p>jigger on the handle that will make her </p><p>prick up her ears at a touch. I gives her a </p><p>few touches, and marvels at how fast the </p><p>mesquite goes past, when all to once I hears </p><p>a yelp, and we hits something or somebody, </p><p>and when I stops I’m cross ways of the </p><p>road. </p><p> My machine is as dead as a nail. Pretty</p><p>soon I hears a rustling noise in the dark, </p><p>and then old man Wliittaker’s voice: </p><p> “Who run into me? Gol dingle dang yuh!</p><p>Blasted mule couldn’t run faster than I </p><p>could! Hey, you feller with a autymobile! </p><p>Ain’t yuh got no sense? Gol dang your </p><p>soul, I’ll show yuh how yuh can run me </p><p>down! Bang!" </p><p> He cut loose with that six-gun, and I drops</p><p>out the other side and sneaks behind a tree. </p><p> I hears the old man cussing some more,</p><p>and pretty soon he finds the machine and </p><p>strikes a match. He has to light the second </p><p>one before he finds what he’s looking for. </p><p>He holds the match above his head for a </p><p>minute and then wails: </p><p> “Gol dang yuh, Chuck! Why didn’t yuh</p><p>speak? Aw -! Chuckie, where did I </p><p>hit yuh? Can’t yuh speak to a feller? Are </p><p>yuh dead? My-!” </p><p> He’s silent for a spell, and then he</p><p>starts again: </p><p>A Prevaricated Parade </p><p> “Where’s that danged slow-footed mule?</p><p>Here yuh are, yuh long-eared snail! Got to </p><p>get a doctor. Self-defense—nope, acci- </p><p>dent. Whoa! Maybe his neck is broke, </p><p>too. Aw, this ain’t no way to celebrate </p><p>nohow.” </p><p> He pilgrims off up the road, complaining</p><p>about everything and cussing that mule for </p><p>taking him all over the State instead of </p><p>straight to the Cross J. I’d opine that the </p><p>old man was so excited that he’d taken the </p><p>wrong road out of town. </p><p> I hauls the front end of that machine</p><p>around again, and winds her up. If that </p><p>front end hadn’t been against a rock my </p><p>obituary would have been written right </p><p>there in the dusty road, ’cause she’s wide </p><p>open, with no brake set. She’s backing and </p><p>filling when I hops aboard, and we begins </p><p>our merry ride once more. </p><p> I rubs my heel on Chuck’s ear and yells:</p><p>“Chuck, you’re dead! Old man Whit- </p><p>taker shot yuh.” </p><p> “Tha’s good,” he replies. “Same to you</p><p>and many of ’em.” </p><p> We runs slow-like to Paradise, and I</p><p>bumps the front end of the machine into </p><p>McFee’s corral to stop her. I gives Chuck </p><p>an alcoholic anesthetic, and leaves him </p><p>there. I ambles over to the town, and finds </p><p>a crowd in front of. Mike’s place. I moves </p><p>up closer and hears the conversation. </p><p> “It was deplorable,” I hears old man</p><p>Whittaker state, with tears in his voice. “I </p><p>loved Chuck like he was my own son. It </p><p>was a accident, Bill—just accidental. You </p><p>don’t think I’d kill him with malice afore- </p><p>thought, do yuh, Bill?” </p><p> “We can tell better what yuh killed him</p><p>with after we sees the re-mains,” replies </p><p>Bill. “I can’t help jailing yuh, Whit. It’s </p><p>the law. If you’re innocent, yuh ain’t got </p><p>nothing to fear. I got Scenery Sims down </p><p>there now, so yuh won’t get lonesome.” </p><p>“What did Scenery do?” asks the old </p><p>man. </p><p> “Disturbed the peace. This place is law-</p><p>abiding, if yilh asks me. Just for the looks </p><p>of the thing we’ll take Doc Milliken along,</p><p>while we gets your victim’s body. Where </p><p>did yuh say this here dastardly deed was </p><p>done?” </p><p> “It wasn’t dastardly!” whoops the old</p><p>man. “It was accidental, I tell yuh! It </p><p>happens near where the old pack-trail leaves </p><p>the main road. You know where that </p><p>is?” </p><p> “I know. Wait a minute, fellers, and</p><p>I’ll be with yuh.” </p><p> He takes the old man and goes off down</p><p>toward the jail, and when he comes back </p><p>they all gets in that wagon and rattles off </p><p>down the road. The old man must a been </p><p>rattled, ’cause it happens a long ways this </p><p>side of the pack-trail end. That’s where I </p><p>leaves Muley and Telescope. </p><p> Mike and Calamity stands there on the</p><p>porch as the wagon leaves, and I hears Mike </p><p>yell at Bill: </p><p> “Hey, Bill! Be sure and get back before</p><p>sunrise on account of them salutes.” </p><p> “What salutes is them?” asks Calamity.</p><p>“Bill’s got ’em down in the jail. He’s got </p><p>five ten-gallon kerosene cans full of water </p><p>down there, and in each can is six sticks of </p><p>dynamite, wrapped in canvas and covered </p><p>with axle-grease. They’re all ready to </p><p>touch off. Some salute, eh? Now, if </p><p>Bill’s late we won’t have our sunrise sa- </p><p>lute.” </p><p> They goes back inside. I looks at my</p><p>watch, and sees that it’s danged near morn- </p><p>ing, and at the same time I gets a happy </p><p>idea. I ambles back to the autymobile, </p><p>and finds Chuck setting on the seat, holding </p><p>his head in his hands. </p><p> “Henry,” says he, “how came I here, and</p><p>why am I so dry?” </p><p> “I brought yuh here, Chuck, and I hid</p><p>the jug under the wagon.” </p><p> I gives him a shock and he gets en-</p><p>thusiastic. </p><p> “Chuck,” says I, “would yuh like to hear</p><p>a big, big noise?” </p><p> “That’s the idea, Henry—a great big</p><p>noise. Can’t be too big. Where yuh going </p><p>to get it?” </p><p> I tells him about them loaded cans down</p><p>at the jail, and he’s for me. We enthuses </p><p>over the jug a little more, and then goes </p><p>down to the jail. I posts Chuck about a </p><p>hundred feet from the jail, and tells him to </p><p>watch for anybody coming from town. </p><p>FwHnnrl THE Paradise jail ain’t much. </p><p>It’s one story, mostly dobe, and </p><p>stands way out from any other </p><p>shack, a grim reminder that there still is law </p><p>and order—at times. A strong man might </p><p>kick the walls loose if they wasn’t afraid the </p><p>roof would fall on ’em. I takes a rock and </p><p>busts the padlock. There’s only one cell in </p><p>the place, and when I lights a match I sees </p><p>the faces of Scenery Sims and the old man. </p><p>164 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>I busts the lock off the cell door, and lets ’em </p><p>out. </p><p> “Vamoose!” I whispers. “Get a-go-</p><p>ing. We don’t want no lynching in Para- </p><p>dise on the Fourth of July.” </p><p> “But, Henry—” squeaks Scenery.</p><p> “No time for argument!” I snaps.</p><p>“You’ll find out later. Go fast and far. </p><p>Sabe?” </p><p> “I’ll make this right with you, Henry,”</p><p>says the old man, earnest-like, and I nods </p><p>in the dark and says to myself— </p><p> “You’ll likely try.”</p><p> They Slips out together, and in about a</p><p>minute I hears Chuck come up to the door, </p><p>and he seems peevish over something. </p><p> “Hen!” he whispers. “Aw, Hen! Henry</p><p>Peck!” </p><p> I don’t say nothing, and pretty soon he</p><p>remarks, sad-like: </p><p> “Drunk. Saw two Henry Pecks go away</p><p>from here. Must be drunk as a boiled </p><p>owl.” </p><p> He goes out of hearing, complaining to</p><p>himself about the effects of alcohol on the </p><p>optic nerves. </p><p> I takes the dynamite out of them cans</p><p>and puts it in one pile on the floor. Bill </p><p>must a been afraid of that stuff, ’cause he’s </p><p>got about ten minutes’ worth of extra </p><p>fuse. </p><p> I runs the fuse out the door, puts the pad-</p><p>lock back in place, and touches her off. I </p><p>goes back up to Mike’s place but don’t go </p><p>in. Mike and Calamity are playing cards, </p><p>while they waits for Chuck’s body to arrive, </p><p>so I goes over and climbs up on the hitch- </p><p>rack. I gets up there, and gets right down. </p><p>Comes a rumble and a shake, the town is lit </p><p>up for a second, and then it begins to rain </p><p>pieces of jail all over town. Thirty sticks </p><p>of dynamite is some little dwelling-mover. </p><p> Mike and Calamity staggers out on the</p><p>porch, and gazes at the world. </p><p> “What do yuh reckon it was?” gasps</p><p>Calamity. </p><p> “Dynamite!” yells Mike. “There’s-</p><p>to pay and no pitch hot!” </p><p> “BillMcFee insisted on leaving that stuff</p><p>in the jail until it was time to touch it off, </p><p>and he done put old man Whittaker and </p><p>Scenery Sims in there—and—they both </p><p>smoke!” </p><p> “Gosh all hemlock!” wails Calamity.</p><p>“There ain’t a tiling we can do, is there, </p><p>Mike?” </p><p> “Nothing. When you’re near thirty</p><p>sticks of dynamite, and she goes off, there </p><p>ain’t notliing that anybody can do—not </p><p>even the coroner.” </p><p> They don’t much more than get inside,</p><p>when I hears the rattle of wheels, and into </p><p>Paradise comes the ambulance. They </p><p>swings around in front of the place and </p><p>stops. Out comes Mike and Calamity. </p><p> “Was he dead?” asks Mike, and we hears</p><p>McFee snort: </p><p> “Old man Whittaker must be crazy!</p><p>We couldn’t find Chuck nor the autymobile. </p><p>All we found was Muley and Telescope, set- </p><p>ting along the road trying to sing. They </p><p>don’t know about no shooting scrape. </p><p>Whittaker is a danged old liar!” </p><p> “Don’t speak disrespectable of the dead,”</p><p>advises Calamity. “No matter how a man </p><p>acted in this vale of tears yuh hadn’t ought </p><p>to besmirch his memory with recrimina- </p><p>tions.” </p><p> “He ain’t dead, I tell yuh!” yelps Bill.</p><p>“Well,” says Mike, “if he ain’t he’s </p><p>made of iron. No man can stand a shock </p><p>like that and ever be the same.” </p><p> “Shock? Who do yuh mean—Chuck?”</p><p>“No,” says Mike, sad-like. “I mean </p><p>Whittaker.” </p><p> “And Scenery Sims,” adds Calamity, re-</p><p>moving his hat. “They must a threw a </p><p>match on to a fuse. The padlock came </p><p>through the back door, and is sticking in </p><p>Mike’s bar.” </p><p> There’s complete silence for a while, and</p><p>then McFee gasps— </p><p> “My-!”</p><p> He yanks the team around, and away he</p><p>goes, rattlety bang, down toward the jail, </p><p>while the crowd races along behind him. </p><p>Muley and Telescope sets there on the steps </p><p>and finishes up their song. </p><p> “Ret-ret-retribution,” pronounces Tele-</p><p>scope. “The old man kills Chuck, and then </p><p>gets hoist with his own petard.” </p><p> “Hoisted,” corrects Muley. “I never</p><p>heard dynamite called petard but a rose by </p><p>any other name would smell as sweet. Some </p><p>celebration, eh, Telescope. I wonder if </p><p>anybody has yet killed Henry Peck this fair </p><p>morning?” </p><p> “The day is yet young, so why worry?”</p><p>says Telescope. “I fain wouldst look upon </p><p>the red when it is wine. Let’s tend a little </p><p>bar, Muley.” </p><p> I wanders around back of Mike’s place.</p><p>I feels weary, and when I notices Mike’s </p><p>little barn, I gets an inspiration. Why not </p><p>A Prevaricated Parade </p><p>165 </p><p>sleep until celebration time? I climbs into </p><p>the loft and sprawls on the hay. </p><p> “All the comforts of home,” says I out</p><p>loud. </p><p> “Hey, Henry,” comes a whisper. “Was</p><p>Chuck dead?” </p><p> “Uh-huh,” says I. “Is Scenery with</p><p>yuh?” </p><p> “He is,” squeaks Scenery. “What was</p><p>that explosion, Henry?” </p><p> “They say that Harelip and Pole Cat</p><p>blew up the jail. I don’t know how much </p><p>truth there is in it.” . </p><p> “Henry,” quavers the old man, “you was</p><p>a friend in need. I’ll-” </p><p> Just then a faint voice begins singing,</p><p>somewhere in the hay. It’s a voice that </p><p>nobody ever heard and forgot. Cross be- </p><p>tween a greaseless wheel and pneumonia. </p><p> “‘Rockuhvages clef’ for me-e-e, le’ me</p><p>hide myself-’ ” </p><p> We listens for a few seconds. Old man</p><p>Whittaker gathers his legs under himself like </p><p>a rabbit, and shoots out a that hay-loft like </p><p>a swaller. We hears him hit the ground </p><p>and gallop out of range. Scenery don’t say </p><p>a word. He yawns, crawls over to the win- </p><p>dow, and lets himself down, easy-like, and </p><p>sneaks away. </p><p> “Henry,” says Chuck, “did I hear your</p><p>voice?” </p><p> “You did.”</p><p> “Stop talking to yourself, you shepherd,</p><p>and let a man sleep. I had a awful dream, </p><p>Henry. Dreamed that the world blowed </p><p>up. It hit me and—ho, hum-m-m!” </p><p> “Ho, hum-m-m-m!” says I, and goes to</p><p>sleep, too. </p><p>WHEN I woke up the birds were</p><p>singing, and the sun was shining </p><p>through the cracks in the loft. </p><p>Chuck is still snoring, so I climbs down </p><p>alone. I’m as dry as a drouth in Arizona, </p><p>so I pilgrims into Mike’s place regardless of </p><p>consequences. </p><p> The place is fairly filled, and sadness is the</p><p>prevailing color scheme. On the bar stands </p><p>Scenery’s old stove-pipe hat, with a wide </p><p>band of black cloth around it, and Mike’s </p><p>mirror is hung with the emblem of </p><p>mourning. </p><p> McFee is standing there with bowed head,</p><p>and sadness fairly drips from his lips. </p><p> “It’s a most awful situation,” he orates.</p><p>“If we could only find a single piece of ’em. </p><p>There ain’t nothing left—nothing!” </p><p> “There ain’t nothing left of poor Chuck</p><p>either,” tolls Muley. “Poor old Chuck. </p><p>He was a gentleman and a scholar. I’d love </p><p>to gaze upon his face once more. </p><p> “He’s went away and left us</p><p> In the prime of his young life.</p><p> He’s gone from this here vale of tears</p><p> With all it’s joy and strife.</p><p> No more we'll see his banty legs,</p><p> Nor hear him tell a lie.</p><p> He’s vanished from old Paradise,</p><p> And we never said good-by.”</p><p> “That’s a mighty pretty thing, Muley,”</p><p>applauds Pole Cat. "Can’t yuh think of </p><p>something nice to say for old man Whit- </p><p>taker?” </p><p> “The rest of you fellers stand back from</p><p>Pole Cat and Harelip, and old man Whit- </p><p>taker will say something for himself,” states </p><p>a voice at the door, and there stands the old </p><p>man, with a shotgun which he levels at </p><p>Pole Cat and Harelip. </p><p> The crowd obeys. Bill McFee’s legs</p><p>get so weak that he sets down on the </p><p>bar-rail where he gasps like a fish out of </p><p>water. </p><p> “You danged pair of dynamiters!” snaps</p><p>the old man. “With the shadder of the </p><p>gallows staring me in the eye, and Chuck </p><p>Warner’s ghost haunting my dreams, I </p><p>comes back to show yuh that your das- </p><p>tardly deed failed. When yuh blowed up </p><p>that jail yuh didn’t get me and Scenery. </p><p>Sabe? Shut up!” he snaps, as Harelip </p><p>starts to say something. “Don’t try to </p><p>deny it, Harelip. I can prove it by the </p><p>heero what let us out. There he stands, </p><p>gents. Henry Clay Peck. He busted the </p><p>lock and liberated-” </p><p> The crowd turns to look at me, but I don’t</p><p>seem to be the point of interest at that. </p><p>They looks right past me. Old man Whit- </p><p>taker’s gun slips from his hands, and clangs </p><p>on the floor. I twists my neck and looks </p><p>behind me, and there stands Chuck. He </p><p>yawns and leans against the pool-table. </p><p> “Well,” says Chuck, in a dry voice,</p><p>“ain’t somebody going to set ’em up? </p><p>Sleeping in timothy makes a feller dry.” </p><p> Bill McFee looks at Chuck and back at</p><p>Whittaker and the tears of joy runs out of </p><p>his eyes. Whittaker leans against the door </p><p>and tries to laugh, but he can’t. </p><p> “Haw!” says Harelip, but that’s as far as</p><p>he got. </p><p> Chuck ambles up to the bar, and looks</p><p>’em over. </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Holy henhawlts!” he snorts. “Have</p><p>yuh all gone loco?” </p><p> “Ain't—ain’t yuh dead, Chuck?” stutters</p><p>the old man. </p><p> “Almost—from thirst.”</p><p> Bill McFee has been looking, steady-like,</p><p>at me for some time, and when he gets on his </p><p>feet he sort of starts edging toward me. I </p><p>edges the other way, sort of unconcerned- </p><p>like, and bumps into Calamity. He’s got a </p><p>billiard cue in his hands. </p><p> “Henry,” he whispers, “you lied to me.”</p><p>I nods, kicks his feet out from under him, </p><p>and goes out of that back door like a shot. </p><p>I races around to the front, and runs into </p><p>something. They’re grouped, and I’m into </p><p>’em before I has time to think. </p><p> There’s the two Mudgett sisters, Hulda</p><p>Peterson, Annie Schmidt, Mrs. Benson, </p><p>Maggie Smith, Clarice Chaffin and the </p><p>widder Saunders. The male members of </p><p>the vigilance committee is Abe Mudgett and </p><p>Breezy Benson. </p><p> “We’ve been waiting for you, Henry,”</p><p>states the widder, sort of belligerent-like, </p><p>and the chorus sings the last four words. </p><p> “We’re looking for a little explanation</p><p>from you,” states Breezy Benson, and Abe </p><p>nods— </p><p> “We desires the same.”</p><p> “Exactly,” says I. “In the course of</p><p>human e-vents-” </p><p> “Grab that dynamiter!” yells McFee,</p><p>from the front door, and Breezy tried to foi- </p><p>ler instructions. Anybody that reaches out </p><p>to grasp old man Peck’s loving son Henry, in </p><p>times of stress, is in continuous danger. </p><p>Breezy got it on the jaw, and yours truly </p><p>went away from there with the enraged citi- </p><p>zens on the trail. </p><p> Never again do I sic a pack of hounds</p><p>after a coyote. What few broncs are in </p><p>town are immediate and soon rode after me, </p><p>and I sure have a plenty to attend to. I </p><p>got a good start, but I know I can’t keep it</p><p>forever. I’m hopping oh' down a washout, </p><p>when I happens to see McFee’s corral. I </p><p>gets an idea right there. </p><p> The gang is quite a ways behind me, try-</p><p>ing to make me come out of a old shack, so’ I </p><p>takes a chance and races for lhat corral. </p><p>The autymobile is pointed the wrong way, </p><p>and I ain’t got no time to turn it around. I </p><p>yanks the front wheels around, sets the </p><p>brake, grabs the crank and prays. Bingo! </p><p>She took it the first turn. I yanks off the </p><p>brake, and away I goes, straight for the </p><p>posse. </p><p> I yanks the little jigger down and we sure</p><p>hits for Paradise in a hurry. They scat- </p><p>ters at my approach, swings in behind me, </p><p>and up the main street of Paradise we goes, </p><p>strung out for a quarter of a mile and </p><p>stretching all the time. </p><p> That machine was a humdinger as long</p><p>as I’m in danger, but when I leaves ’em far </p><p>behind she lays down and quits like a yal- </p><p>ler pup. I sets there and looks around, and </p><p>out into the road wanders three saddled </p><p>broncs. I ducks, thinking they’re some of </p><p>the posse, but a second look tells me that </p><p>they’re some of the broncs what left Para- </p><p>dise yesterday, when the autymobile first </p><p>came in. </p><p> One Cross J bronc has a long rope drag-</p><p>ging,- so I catches him and then ropes the </p><p>other two. I strings out across the hills </p><p>toward home, puts ’em in the home corral, </p><p>and goes to bed. I reckon it’s almost morn- </p><p>ing when the Cross J bunch gets home. </p><p>Muley, Telescope, Chuck and the old man </p><p>all comes into the bunk-house, but they </p><p>don’t see me. </p><p> “Ho, hum-m-m-m!” yawns the old man.</p><p>“I’m glad to be home. This has been one </p><p>strenuous holiday, fellers.” </p><p> “She sure has,” agrees Telescope. “That</p><p>pe-rade was a humdinger.” </p><p> I sets up in bed and looks ’em over.</p><p> “Pe-rade?” I asks. “Did they have a</p><p>pe-rade?” </p><p> “Yes, little one,” replied Muley. “We</p><p>had a pe-rade that we’ll date time from. </p><p>We had eight Miss Columbuses and-”</p><p> “Who—who led it?” I asks.</p><p> “You did, you danged fool!” whooped</p><p>Telescope. </p><p>OFF THE COURSE </p><p> hy RoyP. Churchill</p><p>Author of‘‘The Welding," “A Shift ItUo Reverse," etc. </p><p> S THE steam-launch shoved off</p><p>from the protecting sides of </p><p>the cruiser Glouster, the fog </p><p>■	swallowed her up in a couple</p><p>of boat lengths, but failed to soften or hide </p><p>the growing enmity between two members </p><p>of her crew. Kirk Morton, the coxswain, </p><p>stood with his hands on the steering wheel, </p><p>and his eyes on the dancing needle of the </p><p>compass, as he guided the launch through </p><p>the ghostly vapor which shut the little </p><p>boat and its crew of five into a world apart. </p><p>Outside on the boat’s small deck in the </p><p>bowman’s place Singleton Smith, until </p><p>recently known as “Hobo” Smith, balanced </p><p>himself on bare widespread toes, holding </p><p>his boat-hook with one hand, and the </p><p>launch’s canopy with the other, while he </p><p>peered forward into the gray wall ahead. </p><p> But the thoughts of these two men were</p><p>little taken up with their work. Their </p><p>closeness to one another, despite the duty </p><p>in hand, was almost an overwhelming </p><p>irritant. Kirk Morton was a master hand </p><p>at the wheel of the steam-launch—nick- </p><p>named the “Jumping Jack”—and he had </p><p>brought her out when waves threatened </p><p>to drown the fire by way of the smoke </p><p>stack; and maneuvered alongside the ship </p><p>when an error of an ounce of pressure on </p><p>the wheel, or a second of time, would have </p><p>smashed her like an egg against the side. </p><p> But coupled with this expertness was a</p><p>certain habit of smuggling aboard a couple </p><p>of bottles of native drink for the use;of </p><p>himself and friends. This morning, on </p><p>account of it, he had been compelled to ask </p><p>for a relief bowman, and as usual, Smith </p><p>had been detailed. </p><p> “Can’t you give me some one else, sir?”</p><p>he complained to the officer of the deck as </p><p>the cargo was loaded. “This fellow’s no </p><p>good.” And the officer had looked at him </p><p>coldly without reply. </p><p> “And the dog, too?” grumbled Morton,</p><p>pointing to the first division’s mascot </p><p>already curled up on one of the boxes in the</p><p>stern sheets. </p><p> “Yes,” said the officer in a tone which</p><p>meant that Morton had gone as far as he </p><p>dared. “Shove off and let’s hear no more.” </p><p> So it was that Kirk Morton not only</p><p>carried Hobo Smith, but Smith’s dog, Arab, </p><p>a full-grown shaggy Airedale, whose home </p><p>from puppyhood had been the forecastle </p><p>of the Glouster, and whose friends were </p><p>Smith’s friends in the exact ratio of that </p><p>relationship, for true to his breed, Arab </p><p>was loyal and Smith was master supreme. </p><p>He lay now between Smith’s widespread feet </p><p>with his head on his paws, and his alert </p><p>brown eyes searching the fog bank ahead with </p><p>every acute instinct. Smith raised one of </p><p>his feet and stroked across the shaggy head, </p><p>and Arab smiled up at him with a wave of </p><p>his tail. </p><p> Unconscious of the obtrusion, the end of</p><p>the tail settled back across Kirk Morton’s </p><p>view of the compass, and with an exclama- </p><p>tion of anger, he struck down across it </p><p>cruelly with the hard edge of his open hand. </p><p>He had expected a yelp of pain, but Arab </p><p>168 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>did not cry out. Instead, he reversed in- </p><p>stantly, and his long-jawed, wicked muzzle </p><p>appeared in Morton’s face. The dog knew </p><p>his enemies as well as his friends, and his </p><p>lips were drawn back from his white keen </p><p>teeth, and his soft brown eyes had become </p><p>bright points of yellow flame. </p><p> Morton jumped back as Smith’s restrain-</p><p>ing hand was laid on Arab. One vicious </p><p>snap of the jaws had come uncomfortably </p><p>close to his face. </p><p> “You’d better hold him,” he told Smith,</p><p>and turned to the fireman behind him. </p><p>“Give me that short slice bar. I’ll fix this </p><p>-pup so he won't be so anxious to take a </p><p>bite out of a fellow. What he needs is a </p><p>few manners.” </p><p> “Let the dog alone,” said Smith, leaning</p><p>over and putting his head under the canopy. </p><p>“Wliat did you want to pinch his tail for? </p><p>He wasn’t hurting you.” </p><p> One of the hardest things that Arab had</p><p>to learn as he grew to full strength was </p><p>that his friends, and even his master, </p><p>preferred sometimes to fight without help </p><p>from him. This was one of the times. </p><p>Smith had dragged him back and told him </p><p>to lie on the deck. Waves of hatred surged </p><p>through him and kept the hair on his back </p><p>in a bristle, but to make doubly sure that </p><p>this time he was not to interfere, his master </p><p>called to the sternman on the launch— </p><p> “Keep Arab out of this, will you,</p><p>Jimmy?” </p><p> At the same time Kirk Morton was</p><p>saying, as he rang to shut off the engine </p><p>and climbed out on deck: </p><p> “We’ll settle this thing now. The dog</p><p>gets a licking, and it just suits me to start </p><p>on you.” Shut in by the fog, and safe </p><p>from interference, it was Morton’s oppor- </p><p>tunity to show Smith his place. “I’ll make </p><p>this boat too hot a place for any trimming </p><p>upstart to light on, trying to take a man’s </p><p>billet away from him.” </p><p> This was Morton’s real grievance. Smith</p><p>had been the joke of the ship, a dirty, un- </p><p>redeemed tramp, and after a bitter struggle, </p><p>helped immeasurably by the Airedale </p><p>puppy, he had fought back to manhood. </p><p>Morton’s words brought the hot blood </p><p>to Smith’s face. It was not his fault that </p><p>the coxswain was becoming unreliable, and </p><p>to be called a trimmer—an officer’s pet— </p><p>was deadly insult to any sailor. He took a </p><p>step forward with fists clenched, and </p><p>Morton met him with a blow. </p><p> The two men were evenly matched in</p><p>size, but Morton had the advantage of </p><p>having his back to the canopy, and the </p><p>comparatively secure footing of the widest </p><p>portion of the small deck, while Smith had </p><p>to balance himself further forward, where </p><p>one step either way or behind him would </p><p>put him overboard. Thus it was that he </p><p>could not well dodge Morton’s blow, so he </p><p>parried and clenched to keep from being </p><p>forced off the deck. Straining and whirling, </p><p>locked in each other’s arms, the two </p><p>stumbled over Smith’s discarded boat-hook </p><p>and fell to the deck, Morton on top. </p><p> Arab whimpered under the restraining</p><p>hand of the sternman, but knew that until </p><p>his master called him, he must keep out. </p><p>With a mighty heave Smith strained up- </p><p>ward to get the advantage, and the men </p><p>rolled back to the wide part of the deck </p><p>just over the steering wheel. </p><p> “Look out, you two!” yelled “Fatty”</p><p>Walters, the engineer, and made a frantic </p><p>grab for the compass. </p><p> He was too late. The instrument was</p><p>upset, rolled to the side of the boat, and fell </p><p>overboard. </p><p> For several precious seconds they con-</p><p>tinued struggling while Walters secured a </p><p>boat-hook, and made ineffectual jabs which </p><p>only succeeded in turning the compass over </p><p>and sinking it lower in the water, as still </p><p>alloat in its small wooden box, it bobbed out </p><p>of reach and disappeared in the fog, for the </p><p>launch was still going ahead of its mo- </p><p>mentum. </p><p> “Cut it out!” appealed the engineer,</p><p>turning his boat-hook on the fighting men. </p><p>“You’ve kicked the compass overboard!” </p><p> With the full meaning of the loss gaining</p><p>a place in their wrought up minds, Smith </p><p>and Morton sat up. </p><p> “It’ll float,” said Morton between pants,</p><p>as he scrambled back into the cockpit and </p><p>rang for full speed. “We’ll pick it up. </p><p>Which way did it go?” </p><p> The fireman pointed, and turning in a</p><p>swift arc the launch cut back into the fog. </p><p>After five minutes of fruitless circling, </p><p>Morton was ready to give up. </p><p> “It’s gone down,” he announced sullenly.</p><p>“We’ll have to go on without it.” </p><p> “We ought to signal the ship with the</p><p>whistle and go back to her for a new com- </p><p>pass.” said Smith. </p><p> “I’m running this launch,” said Morton.</p><p>“Keep your mouth out,” and he turned </p><p>Off The Course </p><p>the boat in what he thought was the general </p><p>direction of the shore and went ahead at </p><p>full speed. </p><p> Yet Smith’s protest had been well taken,</p><p>for the boat was loaded to her full capacity </p><p>with rifle ammunition for the landing party </p><p>ashore, and the search for the compass was </p><p>enough to bewilder any sense of direction. </p><p>CSCP3 THE landing force from the </p><p>1*3*1 Glousler had first taken possession </p><p>“ 1 of the Haitian port’s custom house, </p><p>and gradually widened its sphere of influ- </p><p>ence until it controlled the bay on which </p><p>the town was built. But this bay was </p><p>divided by a point of land from a smaller </p><p>one, which had only a rude cluster of native </p><p>huts on its protected shore-line, but which </p><p>was still in command of the revolutionists. </p><p> The sides of this bay were mountainous</p><p>and thick-grown with jungle vegetation, </p><p>and after a couple of attacks when the </p><p>landing force had found the houses deserted </p><p>by all except the women and children, the </p><p>sailors had adopted the easier policy of </p><p>letting the remnants of revolutionary bands </p><p>driven from the larger town gather there </p><p>unmolested to grow tired of the unequal </p><p>struggle and return to peaceful pursuits, </p><p>cut off as they were from all supplies, par- </p><p>ticularly ammunition. </p><p> But Kirk Morton knew that the blame</p><p>for the loss of the compass would rest on </p><p>him, even though it had been Smith’s foot </p><p>which had sent it overboard, for he was in </p><p>charge and had started the fight, but he </p><p>hoped to have this offset somewhat if he </p><p>could deliver his cargo without delay, and </p><p>so he meant to take a chance. </p><p> After a time Smith spoke again. He</p><p>was standing as far forward as he could </p><p>balance himself, peering intently ahead, and </p><p>the Airedale stood at his side with every </p><p>muscle and nerve alert. </p><p> “It don’t sound right,” he said, and</p><p>despite the anger which leaped over him </p><p>at Morton’s sneer, he continued, “we would </p><p>be out of luck if we hit the upper bay </p><p>instead of the one we control. You know </p><p>the shore is steeper on that side, and it </p><p>would make the engine sounds different.” </p><p>The other men of the crew were interested</p><p>if Morton was not. and Smith kept on. </p><p> “Look at the dog. See how he’s all</p><p>bristled up. He senses something strange </p><p>about where we are.” </p><p> “Bosh!” scoffed Morton, and kept ahead,</p><p>beginning to be worried under his mask of </p><p>indifference, but too proud and too con- </p><p>temptuous of Hobo Smith to acknowledge </p><p>that he might be wrong. </p><p> The fog seemed to be thicker than ever,</p><p>and stubbornly the coxswain drove the </p><p>little boat on through it. His first warning </p><p>of the seriousness of the boat’s danger </p><p>was seeing Hobo Smith and Arab as they </p><p>stood on the bow go plunging forward over- </p><p>board, as the boat’s keel scraped on the </p><p>first outlying branches of a coral reef, and </p><p>came to a sudden stop among the spongy </p><p>dripping mass, being not seriously damaged, </p><p>and almost on an even keel, but stuck hard </p><p>and fast. </p><p> And then Kirk Morton in a moment of</p><p>panic did a very foolish thing. He ordered </p><p>the engineer to back her at full speed, and </p><p>the continued thrash of the screw in its </p><p>ineffectual attempt to pull the boat off </p><p>made noise enough to be heard on the close- </p><p>lying shore, and advertised that the boat </p><p>was in trouble. </p><p> “Pull the whistle cord,” advised Smith.</p><p>“Perhaps the ship will hear us.” </p><p> “We’ll lie still and see where we are,</p><p>first,” objected Morton. “Who knows </p><p>whether we’ve hit the upper bay or not?” </p><p>He had dropped his voice to a hoarse </p><p>whisper, and continued: “There’s been too </p><p>much talking in the boat. Keep quiet, all </p><p>of you.” </p><p> Morton was so anxious to discount any</p><p>suggestion of Smith’s that his own judgment </p><p>was warped. </p><p> At the end of ten minutes the engineer</p><p>whispered a protest. </p><p> “The tide’s going out, and we’re getting</p><p>stuck harder every minute. The fog looks </p><p>like it’s good for a week. Let’s do some- </p><p>thing.” </p><p> But Morton shook his head.</p><p> “You fellows give me a pain,” he said.</p><p>“If we’re in the upper bay, blowing the </p><p>whistle will only bring the rebels down on </p><p>us, and if we’re on our side, we will be </p><p>laughed at for a bunch of boobs. Be game </p><p>and stick it out.” </p><p> Thus appealed to, the engineer gave up</p><p>and went back to wiping his engine with a </p><p>piece of waste. </p><p> “Keep that dog quiet, or choke him,”</p><p>ordered Morton, as Arab strained forward </p><p>over the bow with a low growl. </p><p> The dog’s keen ears had caught the sound</p><p>of a stealthy oar, and fifty yards in front </p><p>170 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>of them the ghostly shape of a native </p><p>dugout appeared. After being challenged </p><p>and allowed to advance under cover of the </p><p>crew’s revolvers, the boat contained only </p><p>two harmless-appearing native women with </p><p>a scanty assortment of fruit, which they </p><p>held up for sale. </p><p> “Just like I told you,” said Morton</p><p>with assurance. “We’ve hit shore some- </p><p>where inside our own bay, and you fellows </p><p>all excited, wanting to blow the whistle </p><p>and raise Ned generally!” </p><p> Then with signs and his scanty supply of</p><p>native jargon, he bought some of the fruit, </p><p>and asked that help be sent out from shore </p><p>to pull the boat of!. The black beady eyes </p><p>of the two women took in every detail </p><p>of the boat’s predicament, and the nature </p><p>of its cargo, while they shrugged and chat- </p><p>tered and seemed to try to make out </p><p>Morton’s instructions. Then abruptly they </p><p>disappeared in the fog. </p><p> Morion was well pleased with himself.</p><p>There seemed a good chance now of getting </p><p>the boat off the reef and the cargo safely </p><p>ashore without having to ask for help, with </p><p>its embarrassing explanations, from the </p><p>ship. But the rest of the crew were not so </p><p>optimistic. Smith at least was uneasy, </p><p>for Arab gave almost constant signs of the </p><p>presence of enemies. </p><p> “Smells some dog ashore,” said Morton.</p><p>But Smith did not answer the thrust, </p><p>for Arab had run to the other end of the </p><p>boat away from shore, and seemed puzzled </p><p>and disturbed. As they watched, from near </p><p>at hand in the fog bank came a dozen rifle </p><p>shots, and two of the bullets went through </p><p>the launch’s canopy. A few seconds after- </p><p>ward from the other side of the boat, but </p><p>further off, came a like fusillade of shots. </p><p> “They’re all around us!” said Fatty</p><p>Walters, as he and the fireman strapped on </p><p>their revolver belts and crouched down in </p><p>the waist of the boat. The other members </p><p>of the crew were already armed. “Guess </p><p>there’s no argument now about where we </p><p>are, or what we’re up against.” </p><p> “They’ll hear the shots out on the ship,”</p><p>said Morton hopefully. </p><p> “You’re a bum guesser,” said the engi-</p><p>neer. “Get busy with the whistle cord, </p><p>like you should have long ago. Firing don’t </p><p>mean anything to the ship. Somebody is </p><p>always doing a little shooting on shore.” </p><p>Smith and Arab had taken their places </p><p>for defense in the stern of the boat behind </p><p>the ammunition cases with Jimmy Wood, </p><p>the sternman, while the coxswain’s place </p><p>was in the bow. </p><p> As Morton took the whistle cord to</p><p>commence his belated signaling, the first </p><p>of the attacking canoes was so close in to </p><p>the bow that he had to let go and crouch </p><p>in the cockpit again as he emptied his </p><p>revolver to repel boarders. Two natives </p><p>armed with rifles fired rapidly from the </p><p>small boat, while their craft was sent </p><p>swiftly along by two other men at the oars. </p><p>Canoe after canoe did this. </p><p> The launch crew would catch a fleeting</p><p>glimpse of a boat as it came in sight, and </p><p>vanished in the fog, and get in a few shots </p><p>at each moving target, some of which were </p><p>hits, while the natives, seeing the larger </p><p>bulk of the launch better, riddled the </p><p>canopy and smokestack and upper sides </p><p>with bullets. </p><p> One of these shots going too high to do</p><p>any damage to the boat’s crew proved a </p><p>luckier chance blow for the attackers than </p><p>if it had struck a man, for it took overboard </p><p>the small brass steam whistle secured to the </p><p>smokestack, and destroyed the launch’s </p><p>only means of communication with the </p><p>Gloiister. The fireman cursed Morton’s </p><p>stubbornness in not using the whistle sooner, </p><p>as he shut off the valve to stop the escaping </p><p>steam, and at the same time the natives </p><p>changed tactics and rushed the launch from </p><p>all sides at once. </p><p> Despite the best efforts of the defenders,</p><p>they seemed determined to take the boat </p><p>by storm, thinking perhaps that the quick </p><p>move of the fireman and the hiss of steam </p><p>meant disaster. But at close range the </p><p>deadly automatics of the five sailors were </p><p>terribly effective, as they stood up at their </p><p>places and emptied the revolvers as swiftly </p><p>as they could push in the fresh clips. </p><p>THE attack collapsed, but not until </p><p>the defenders had paid their toll, as </p><p>well. Jimmy Wood had a bullet </p><p>in the left shoulder, Morton had a nasty </p><p>head wound from a splinter of the deck </p><p>planking, and a bullet had plowed across </p><p>the engineer’s cheek in a deep, painful </p><p>furrow. Smith and the fireman had es- </p><p>caped. </p><p> “I don’t want many more like that,”</p><p>said Walters, as he sank wearily into his </p><p>seat by the engine, and let the fireman tie </p><p>on a first-aid bandage. </p><p>Off The Course </p><p>171 </p><p> Smith was busy with Wood, while Morton</p><p>managed to bandage his own wound. </p><p> “The ship’s bound to miss us and send</p><p>a rescue party,” said the fireman hopefully. </p><p> “Sure,” answered the pessimistic engi-</p><p>neer. “She’ll wait an hour at least, for a </p><p>report from shore, and then she’ll wireless </p><p>in. After that when they locate the C.O. </p><p>the landing party will make a report. Then </p><p>they’ll begin to get busy and then get ready, </p><p>and then start. Where do you think they’ll </p><p>go? Who’s going to put them next to </p><p>where we are? In this fog they’ll have to </p><p>find us before they rescue us. </p><p> “We’ve got to hold on,” said Morton,</p><p>“until they do come.” </p><p> “You can bet it’s hold on,” agreed the</p><p>engineer. “You know what happens to a </p><p>poor boob that’s captured by these spig- </p><p>goties.” </p><p> “We might signal with revolver shots,”</p><p>suggested Smith. “Maybe they could pick </p><p>the shots out, now that it’s quiet again.” </p><p>“It’s a bright scheme,” said Morton </p><p>sarcastically. “What made it take you </p><p>so long to think of it? But jar your brains </p><p>a little. At three miles the sound would </p><p>be mighty faint, even if they caught it at all, </p><p>and we would have to repeat it over and </p><p>over, and not be interrupted by any shots </p><p>from another point while we were doing it. </p><p>Then, you know,” he continued, making the </p><p>explanation childishly simple, so that Smith </p><p>would get the full back-kick from his </p><p>blunder, “even if the stern sheets is full </p><p>of ammunition, you don’t see any rifles </p><p>aboard, do you? And all the revolver </p><p>ammunition we have is what’s left in our </p><p>belts. Any more brilliant suggestions?” </p><p> A soft bump against the launch’s side</p><p>interrupted further talk. The men leaned </p><p>over the side with pistols read)', but only </p><p>an empty native boat had bumped along- </p><p>side. It was a third full of water and its </p><p>blood-stained thwarts gave evidence of what </p><p>had happened. </p><p> “I didn’t think they would tackle it again</p><p>for awhile,” said Morton with relief, as he</p><p>dropped his automatic back into its holster. </p><p> “I remember that boat,” said the fireman,</p><p>as the dugout began to drift away, “because </p><p>it was such a small one. One man was </p><p>firing and one rowing. They got in close </p><p>and Jimmy Wood got them both before they </p><p>fixed him.” </p><p> Smith took a boat-hook and pulled the</p><p>craft alongside. The boat seemed un- </p><p>damaged, and this discovery had suggested </p><p>a plan. He ignored Morton’s growl to let </p><p>the boat alone, and turned to the fireman. </p><p> “What do you use for a bailer?” he asked.</p><p> “What’re you up to?” challenged Morton.</p><p> “Wait and see,” said Smith, turning on</p><p>him furiously. “But don’t try to stop </p><p>me.” </p><p> Morton had provoked his temporary</p><p>bowman to the limit, and the same Smith </p><p>who had come to the defense of his dog, </p><p>and who had refused to let the coxswain’s </p><p>sarcasm and criticism keep him from making </p><p>suggestions for the welfare of the boat, faced </p><p>him now defiantly, ready to fight if he had </p><p>to, to carry out his plan. </p><p> “I’m the boss here, temporized Morton.</p><p>“I’m the coxswain.” </p><p> “Let’s not argue,” cut in Smith. “It</p><p>was your pig-headed stubbornness in going </p><p>on without a compass that got us into this </p><p>fix. I’m going to bail out this boat and </p><p>go after help. It’s the quickest way to tell </p><p>the ship that we’re in trouble, and where </p><p>we are.” </p><p> With the fireman’s tin bucket which he</p><p>used to scrub clothes, Smith let himself </p><p>carefully down into the small boat, and </p><p>began to empty it of water. </p><p> “Let him go,” said Morton to the engi-</p><p>neet. “These spiggoties are all around </p><p>us thick, laying for a move like this. What </p><p>the coward is thinking of is a chance to get </p><p>away with a whole skin himself.” </p><p> Smith had straightened up, his task</p><p>finished, and heard the last remark. </p><p> “You go then,” he offered Morton, re-</p><p>straining the hot words which came to his </p><p>lips, but leaving his fists clenched. “Can’t </p><p>you see that if we don’t use this chance to go </p><p>for help it means not only death to us, but </p><p>to dozens of our shipmates if the natives </p><p>capture the ammunition? Who goes doesn’t </p><p>make any difference, just so somebody </p><p>does go.” </p><p> His earnestness had an effect on Morton,</p><p>who answered sullenly: </p><p> “The chances are better here. They’re</p><p>sure to get anybody that makes a dash for </p><p>the ship. Your best chance is to stay and </p><p>fight it out with us.” </p><p> “I’ll go, then,” said Smith, as he un-</p><p>strapped his ammunition belt, and handed </p><p>it over. “I’ll keep what’s in the gun,” </p><p>he said. </p><p> Then giving the word to the eager</p><p>Airedale, who jumped down beside him, </p><p>172 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Smith took up the paddle, and shoved </p><p>silently off into the gray wall of fog. </p><p> In half a dozen strokes the launch had</p><p>disappeared, and paddling silently Smith </p><p>headed in obliquely toward shore. His </p><p>plan was to let the shore-line guide him to </p><p>the outer point, and from there head for </p><p>the ship, letting the run of waves outside </p><p>determine his general direction, and hoping </p><p>by this means to strike somewhere near </p><p>enough to hear some sound from her, like </p><p>the striking of the bell, or the calling of an </p><p>order. Watching for a glimpse of the </p><p>steep sandy beach, or the faint outline of a </p><p>tree or shrub, Smith failed to give enough </p><p>attention to the growing uneasiness of Arab. </p><p>A growl warned him, and he looked aside to </p><p>where the dog’s muzzle pointed. </p><p> Out of the fog came a native canoe, a</p><p>large one, with four paddlers and two rifle- </p><p>men. They saw Smith even before he </p><p>saw them, and a challenge rang out, for </p><p>the fog had turned both natives and white </p><p>man into gray shapes without identity. </p><p>Smith was afraid to answer for fear his </p><p>voice would betray him, and as if he did </p><p>not hear, he kept on obliquely past the other </p><p>canoe, but the challenge was repeated, and </p><p>the larger boat moved forward to block </p><p>his course. Seeing that discovery was un- </p><p>avoidable, Smith opened fire, sending the </p><p>six shots from his automatic into the center </p><p>of the crowded boat, and then paddled </p><p>ahead feverishly. </p><p> The natives had not been sure that the</p><p>small boat contained an enemy, and were </p><p>anxious to save their scanty store of ammu- </p><p>nition, besides not wanting to betray their </p><p>position in the ring of boats that encircled </p><p>the launch. The heavy revolver fired at </p><p>close range killed the rifleman in the bow, </p><p>who fell forward across the gunwale, giving </p><p>the boat an ugly list, wounded two of the </p><p>paddlers, and so confused and handicapped </p><p>the second rifleman that Smith’s boat was </p><p>disappearing into the fog before he could </p><p>free himself from the body of the paddler </p><p>who had fallen backward acrpss his legs, </p><p>put his weight on the light side of the boat </p><p>to keep it from capsizing, and fire. </p><p>SMITH was bending low, paddling</p><p>with all his strength. A bullet came </p><p>through the thin side of the boat </p><p>just above the water’s edge, and another </p><p>seared his back like the stinging cut of a </p><p>vicious whip. The native, for a rarity, </p><p>was a good shot, and only the fog saved </p><p>Smith. As he whirled the boat’s head </p><p>into a new course to offset the rifleman’s </p><p>aim, he realized that the man could no longer </p><p>see him or the boat, and hurried away from </p><p>the angry smack of the bullets in the water </p><p>around the spot where he had disappeared. </p><p> The native boat with its dead and</p><p>wounded and a hole in the bottom the size </p><p>of a man’s thumb, where one of Smith’s </p><p>bullets had been deflected and tore end </p><p>over end instead of boring through, could </p><p>not give chase, and following the shore-line </p><p>Smith made the mouth of the bay and </p><p>headed for the ship. </p><p> Fortunately for his cockle-shell, the sea</p><p>was smooth, there only being enough </p><p>motion in the gentle swells to give him </p><p>direction. There was no wind. The fog </p><p>still lay a damp enveloping pall over every- </p><p>thing. From his watch Smith knew that </p><p>he had been away from the launch less than </p><p>fifteen minutes, and since there had come </p><p>no sound of shots or of a struggle behind </p><p>him, he knew that the Jumping Jack with </p><p>its crew and cargo was yet safe. </p><p> Roughly, from the point of land to the</p><p>ship’s position was about two miles, and </p><p>paddling steadily Smith took up his muscle- </p><p>and-nerve-trying task. Not only must he </p><p>paddle with all his strength, but to keep </p><p>his direction he must watch constantly the </p><p>roll of the sea and pay no attention to the </p><p>disconcerting influence of the fog. He </p><p>hoped to make it in half an hour. He must </p><p>make it, he told himself, or it would have </p><p>been better if he had stayed to help in the </p><p>defense of the launch. </p><p> At the end of fifteen minutes he stopped</p><p>to listen. Weirdly and faintly as if it </p><p>might be imagination, he caught the strik- </p><p>ing of five bells. </p><p> “We’re going back to the ship,” he said</p><p>to the dog. “Do you get me, Arab, old </p><p>man?” </p><p> In answer the dog whined understand-</p><p>ingly, and thrust up his nose to take </p><p>Smith’s caressing strokes. </p><p> “Where’s the ship, Arab?” said Smith,</p><p>an idea coming to him, and the dog ran to </p><p>the bow and leaned over, letting out a little </p><p>yelp of eagerness. “Good boy!” said </p><p>Smith, and repeated, “Back to the ship, </p><p>Arab, back to the ship!” as he took up the </p><p>paddle to commence his work again. </p><p> The crease across his back was beginning</p><p>to burn and stiffen, and from behind him </p><p>Off The Course </p><p>173 </p><p>shoreward had come an intense outburst of </p><p>firing, but whether from the vicinity of the </p><p>launch or from some other point ashore, </p><p>he was unable to determine. Then came </p><p>a danger which he had not counted on. </p><p>The next native boat in line from the one </p><p>he had run foul of, had rushed in at the </p><p>sound of firing, found the disabled boat, </p><p>and followed from where he had disap- </p><p>peared in the fog. </p><p> Not the zigzag course around the shore-</p><p>line, but straight out to the mouth of the </p><p>bay to head him off in his dash for the ship. </p><p>By chance he had eluded them there, </p><p>but knowing the direction of the ship, and </p><p>thinking that the sailor would now take a </p><p>straight course, they came swiftly after, </p><p>being guided finally by the sound of Smith’s </p><p>inexpert paddling. </p><p> Arab’s stiffening bristles and his interest</p><p>at the stem of the boat, warned Smith of </p><p>the presence of enemies. Soon he, as well </p><p>as Arab, caught the sound of the pursuing </p><p>boat, so close that it was only a question </p><p>of minutes until it would be near enough </p><p>for the natives to see him. Smith’s only </p><p>chance to dodge was while still hidden </p><p>in the fog, and dipping his paddle with as </p><p>little noise as possible, he turned abruptly </p><p>to one side, and after a dozen strokes quit </p><p>paddling to listen. </p><p> The native boat went by so close that he</p><p>could hear the suck of the paddles and the </p><p>slap of the bow against the water, and then, </p><p>no longer hearing him as a guide ahead </p><p>of them, Smith heard a half-toned order, </p><p>and the native boat stopped also, so that </p><p>the keen ears of its occupants could pick </p><p>up the trail again. </p><p> Smith was afraid to paddle, afraid almost</p><p>to move, and Arab stood motionless beside </p><p>him, restrained from all soimd by his </p><p>master’s stroking hand. His presence gave </p><p>Smith a plan of action. With the point </p><p>of his jack-knife he scrawled on the dog’s </p><p>brass collar, “Help! Launch upper bay,” </p><p>and that done, he bent over and, putting </p><p>command and faith and entreaty into his </p><p>tone, whispered softly into Arab’s ear— </p><p> “Go to the ship.”</p><p> The dog seemed bewildered for a moment,</p><p>and so Smith lifted him carefully and placed </p><p>him over the side into the water. Then </p><p>he pointed and again whispered his order, </p><p>commandingly, almost harshly, and the </p><p>dog with one glance backward to make sure, </p><p>commenced swimming ahead. </p><p> “Go to the ship,” repeated Smith with</p><p>his lips, and Arab looked back one more </p><p>time to catch his master’s hand waving </p><p>him on. </p><p> Then-noisily Smith took up the paddle</p><p>and commenced to row in the other direc- </p><p>tion. Immediately from the fog came the </p><p>answering swish of water, as the native </p><p>boat came after him. </p><p> Smith knew that free from interference</p><p>the dog would make the ship, and he pad- </p><p>died shoreward long enough to make sure </p><p>that Arab was not discovered before he </p><p>dodged again. This time the natives were </p><p>close enough to see him. He turned the </p><p>little boat swiftly, and by a desperate effort </p><p>regained the shelter of the fog. The </p><p>natives were too close to the ship to risk </p><p>the alarm of gun-fire, and preferred a more </p><p>silent method of disposing of the mes- </p><p>senger. </p><p> Smith felt this, and with the growing</p><p>distress from his wound, knew that he </p><p>could not hope to dodge the larger boat </p><p>much longer, so while still hidden, he aban- </p><p>doned the boat, preferring to take his </p><p>chance by swimming and floating with the </p><p>tide toward the ship, than to fall into the </p><p>hands of the natives. </p><p> To help keep afloat, he took both the</p><p>boat’s paddles. He was just in time, for </p><p>safe in the fog bank, he heard the two </p><p>boats scrape together, and the contention </p><p>of excited voices. The firing on shore </p><p>had broken out afresh. Smith floated on </p><p>his back, afraid to make strokes for fear </p><p>the splashing would betray his position, </p><p>and planned to dive under the surface, </p><p>if he heard the boat coming nearer. The </p><p>argument continued. </p><p> Part of the natives wanted to con-</p><p>tinue the search for the swimmer, while </p><p>the others, stimulated by the shots ashore </p><p>and disgusted with the fruitlessness of</p><p>their chase, wanted to get back into the </p><p>attack on the launch. </p><p> This faction won out, and Smith heard</p><p>the sound of a hatchet, as the bottom of </p><p>the small boat was smashed in, and then </p><p>the sound of paddling growing fainter as </p><p>the boat went shoreward. Cautiously he </p><p>swam back toward the wrecked boat, and </p><p>after a search which left him exhausted, </p><p>threw his tired body across its sunken edge, </p><p>for though destroyed for the use of a paddle, </p><p>there was enough buoyancy left in the wood </p><p>to keep him afloat. </p><p>174 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>DICK REASONER was seeing to </p><p>the adjusting of a side-cleaner’s </p><p>stage when a moving spot out on </p><p>the fog-wreathed water attracted him. He </p><p>rubbed his eyes, and beckoned to “Slim” </p><p>Higgins. </p><p> “What’s a seal doing six thousand miles</p><p>away from home?” he demanded. </p><p> “Where?” asked Slim, trying to follow</p><p>Reasoner’s pointing finger, and then “Dic- </p><p>tionary Dick” made a wild dash toward the </p><p>gangway. </p><p> “It’s Arab,” he flung back over his</p><p>shoulder,” and swimming with just his </p><p>nose out like he was about done for.” </p><p> A moment later he was helping the dog</p><p>aboard, where safe on the lower platform </p><p>Arab stood up and shook himself before </p><p>he followed Dictionary Dick up the ladder. </p><p> “What’s up, old boy?” asked Reasoner,</p><p>stroking his wet head. “Something wrong </p><p>with the launch?” </p><p> Arab turned back toward the gangway</p><p>and spoke the only language of entreaty </p><p>he knew—a low whine. </p><p> “If Smith sent a message, Arab must</p><p>have lost it,” said Higgins. “Nothing is </p><p>tied to his collar.” </p><p> “Maybe there’s something under it,”</p><p>answered Reasoner, and unbuckling the </p><p>iet leather, he took it off for a closer look. </p><p>The fresh scratches on the brass name plate </p><p>attracted him. </p><p>Help! Launch upper bay. </p><p> Meanwhile, the first lieutenant had</p><p>become uneasy at the launch’s late return. </p><p>To be half an hour-late from slow running </p><p>to and from shore in the fog was reasonable, </p><p>but when the launch was an hour overdue, </p><p>he wirelessed an inquiry ashore. To make </p><p>sure there was no mistake, each person in </p><p>authority, including the commanding offi- </p><p>cers of the blue-jackets and marines and </p><p>their supply departments, was notified </p><p>before a reply was made, and when it did</p><p>come, bearing undeniable proof that the </p><p>launch had gone astray, the first lieutenant </p><p>consulted the captain, and then ordered </p><p>the reserve landing party called away. </p><p> The bugles commenced their shrill calls</p><p>to “Cast loose and provide,” “Lower all </p><p>boats,” and “Away, landing party,” just </p><p>as Dictionary Dick made his discovery of </p><p>the message on Arab’s collar. </p><p> “Good,” cried the first lieutenant, as</p><p>Reasoner handed him the collar. “This </p><p>tells us where to go at once, without any </p><p>blindman’s buff in the fog. The dog </p><p>ought to have a medal. Grab a squad out </p><p>of the first and second divisions. We’ll </p><p>take the second steamer and let the slower </p><p>boats follow as they get away. Get me </p><p>the compass course for the upper bay,” </p><p>he told the officer of the deck, “and see </p><p>that every boat has it before they shove off.” </p><p>TO THE men on the launch the </p><p>second attack had come and failed, </p><p>but had left them with only the </p><p>revolver ammunition which their guns held. </p><p>The unlucky Jimmy Wood had received </p><p>another wound, but propped among the </p><p>ammunition cases he refused to give up. </p><p>The second attack had been better planned </p><p>than the first, and the natives had kept </p><p>further away so that they had suffered </p><p>less, while the launch crew used more </p><p>ammunition, and made fewer hits. </p><p> “Here comes one of them with a white</p><p>rag on a paddle,” announced Walters. </p><p>“What do you say I take a shot at him? </p><p>I don’t trust these fellows, white flag or </p><p>not.” </p><p> “Let him come on,” advised Morton,</p><p>and the native boat came close enough for </p><p>conversation. </p><p> From a quick flow of words from this</p><p>native, Morton interpreted the command, </p><p>“Vamose, no kill,” or words to that effect. </p><p> “I don’t get you, said Morton in the</p><p>native tongue. </p><p> With gestures the native repeated his</p><p>offer. </p><p> “He wants us to beat it, and leave the</p><p>ammunition,” interpreted the engineer. </p><p>“He says they’ll let us go away safely.” </p><p> “Nothing doing,” said Jimmy Wood.</p><p>“I don’t trust him, and what are we going </p><p>to get away in, anyhow? You know what </p><p>they did to the marine sentry they caught.” </p><p> “I don’t know, fellows,” hesitated Mor-</p><p>ton. “It looks as if it might be our only </p><p>chance, if they’d furnish us boats. They’re </p><p>bound to get us-” </p><p> He was interrupted by an outburst of</p><p>firing, and bullets began to screech and </p><p>sing through the canopy as the men dodged </p><p>down. With their attention directed to </p><p>the man with the flag of truce, it was too </p><p>good an opportunity for a surprise attack </p><p>for the natives to miss. </p><p> “I got that one, anyhow,” said Jimmy</p><p>Wood, as the man with the rag on his </p><p>Off The Course </p><p>175 </p><p>paddle stooped to pick up a gun from the </p><p>bottom of the boat and lurched overboard. </p><p> From all about them the attack developed</p><p>with new fury, and the sailors carefully </p><p>hoarding each cartridge, fired only when </p><p>an actual hit seemed probable. With the </p><p>slacking of resistance, the attacking boats </p><p>grew bolder and came in closer, riddling </p><p>the upper part of the launch with bullets </p><p>while the sailors crouched on the bottom </p><p>with almost empty revolvers, waiting for </p><p>the rifle-fire to cease and the end to come. </p><p>Morton had rifled the boat box for the ax, </p><p>while the engineer put his trust in a heavy </p><p>wrench, and the fireman in a short slice bar. </p><p> “Here they come,” cried Jimmy Wood,</p><p>taking a firmer grip on the heavy spare </p><p>tiller which he had taken from its rack </p><p>under the seat, and firing the last of his </p><p>cartridges at the leading boat. </p><p> Echoing his words came the shrill call</p><p>of a steam launch’s whistle, and the despera- </p><p>tion in Wood’s tone faded out instantly. </p><p> “Shout!” he cried. “All together! It’s</p><p>help from the ship!” </p><p>“Boat ahoy!” the men called and were </p><p>answered by another blast from the whistle. </p><p> The natives fired a last scattering volley,</p><p>and at a command from the leader, paddled </p><p>shoreward to where the fog bank let down </p><p>its sheltering wall. Again the launch sig- </p><p>naled, and guided by shouts from the </p><p>boat’s crew, soon came in sight. </p><p> “We’re on a reef,” cried Morton. “Don’t</p><p>get too close!” </p><p> A few minutes later the boats under oars</p><p>began to arrive, and while some of them </p><p>guarded against another attack, the launch </p><p>was lightened of its load of ammunition, </p><p>and pulled off the reef by a line from the </p><p>other steamer. Then the belated cargo </p><p>of ammunition was sent around the point </p><p>to its destination, the guard boats were </p><p>called in, and the rescuing expedition </p><p>started back to its ship. </p><p> Dick Reasoner was worried about his</p><p>friend Singleton Smith. He had con- </p><p>fidently expected to find him in the rescued </p><p>launch, and Jimmy Wood’s story of what </p><p>had happened did not reassure him. </p><p> “We heard shooting soon after he put</p><p>off,” said Wood. “That’s when they done </p><p>for him, but it’s a blessing he was game </p><p>enough to send the dog on to deUver the </p><p>message. A few minutes more and [that </p><p>bunch of spiggoties would have had enough </p><p>ammunition to last ’em a year. Besides,” </p><p>he smiled grimly, “the Glouster would have </p><p>been shy five men instead of one.” </p><p> “We’ll fan out as we go back,” instructed</p><p>the first lieutenant. “I’m hoping yet we </p><p>will find Smith alive, and if we do, he’s to </p><p>be coxswain of the launch. I’m disgusted </p><p>with Morton.” </p><p> Reasoner was afraid to hope. The</p><p>chances against Smith looked too big, </p><p>but he remembered now the queer actions of </p><p>Arab as the second steamer came ashore. </p><p>The dog had been all eagerness, and yelped </p><p>with joy from his place on the bow as they </p><p>started, but when a few hundred yards </p><p>away from the ship, had suddenly leaped </p><p>overboard. On an errand of life and death </p><p>the boat had no time to stop for him. </p><p> “He’ll make it back to the ship,” said</p><p>Slim Higgins. “He’s all worried because </p><p>he can’t find Hobo.” </p><p> The boats reached the ship with the</p><p>problem unsolved, and there found Single- </p><p>ton Smith safe in a cot in the sick bay with </p><p>Aral) stretched out on the deck beside him </p><p>sound asleep. To the dog’s keen instinct </p><p>Smith owed his life, for lying across the </p><p>sunken boat, paddling with his hands in </p><p>the direction of the ship—he had lost the </p><p>paddles—he was so near unconsciousness </p><p>from exhaustion that when the launch </p><p>passed near him on its way ashore, he could </p><p>be heard by the men. </p><p> But the supersensitive ears of the dog</p><p>had caught his master’s voice, and the </p><p>coming of Arab gave Smith fresh courage. </p><p>As they drifted and paddled nearer the ship, </p><p>Arab barked loudly for help, and finally </p><p>guided the dingey to them. When rescued </p><p>Arab stood up to his neck in the hollowed- </p><p>out boat, and Smith was barely breathing.</p><p> Dictionary Dick tiptoed to the sick bay</p><p>door with a blanket over his arm. It was </p><p>unneeded, for the hospital apprentice had </p><p>already wrapped the wet Airedale in one ol </p><p>his own, and Reasoner went away wiih his </p><p>finger on a word in his little dictionary. Slim </p><p>Higgins caught him scratching his head. </p><p> “Reward,” he said, grinning. “What’s</p><p>the matter with that?” </p><p> “Fine,” said Reasoner, “but where does</p><p>Arab come in? How are we going to </p><p>reward him?” </p><p> “That’s carrying the thing too far,”</p><p>said Slim Higgins. “Try him with a piece </p><p>of fresh meat. ‘Doggone the dictionary, </p><p>if it ain’t practicable,’ Arab would say him- </p><p>self, if he could talk.” </p><p>THE TWELVE </p><p>PADLOCKS by </p><p>Carroll K.Mickener </p><p>Author of “The Woman of The Desert." </p><p>T1"' |HE CARLETON had a habit of </p><p>being crowded at the dinner hour, </p><p>so at tiffin I bribed the blue- </p><p>gowned No. x boy to reserve me a </p><p>table. I am fussy, I confess. I do not like </p><p>to wait for a table and I do not care to dine </p><p>vis-a-vis with a stranger who perhaps takes </p><p>his soup in an unpleasant manner. This is </p><p>the result, doubtless, of being pampered too </p><p>long by the obsequious Orient. </p><p> But I found my table was not reserved</p><p>for me, after all. The stranger who was </p><p>established there had without question </p><p>outbid me in the matter of cumshaw, which </p><p>is the Chinese name for the species of </p><p>brigandage we denominate the “tip.” </p><p>“Boy,” I inquired, in exasperation, “why- </p><p>for you no have reserve table?” </p><p> “Yes, Mahstah, no have reserve,” he</p><p>responded, smilingly, with characteristic </p><p>Chinese indirectness. </p><p> “Why-for—why-for?” I persisted, though</p><p>I knew well enough how futile it was to </p><p>expect a direct answer. </p><p> “Not on account of any reason Mah-</p><p>stah,” the boy assured me seriously, leav- </p><p>ing me to adjust myself, if possible, to the </p><p>situation and to the stranger. </p><p> “Queer fish, these Chinks,” volunteered</p><p>the man at my table. He was irreproach- </p><p>ably, though unpleasantly because of my </p><p>irritation, partaking of his soup. His </p><p>accent advertised him for an American—in </p><p>fact I should have known him for a fellow- </p><p>countryman by no more than the cut of his </p><p>clothes and the angle of his chin. He had </p><p>the weathered look of an ex-soldier combined </p><p>with the appearance of having been long </p><p>ennuied by the exotic life of the East. </p><p> There was a subtle quality about his eyes</p><p>that seemed to reflect evidence of much </p><p>travel in many and diverse lands. That un- </p><p>mistakable quality lurks somewhere about </p><p>all much-traveled persons. There was a </p><p>trace of dissipation in his face—or perhaps</p><p>it was only the souvenir of Oriental fevers. </p><p>He looked withal well seasoned to the </p><p>East. </p><p> I made no answer to his introductory</p><p>remark. I was feeling much too uncivil. </p><p>But apparently he took no notice. There </p><p>are people—born salesmen they must be— </p><p>who cannot be rebuffed. He talked on </p><p>until I was compelled either to reply or beat </p><p>a retreat, and in the end he won me over. </p><p> “Of course,” he was saying, “it was all a</p><p>matter of cumshaw. I offered him more </p><p>than you did. He could not foresee any- </p><p>thing like that when he promised to reserve </p><p>the table for you. Therefore, he would </p><p>argue—if he could argue—that he could not </p><p>be expected to hold to an agreement that </p><p>turned out to his disadvantage Not </p><p>Anglo-Saxon logic, is it? But what interests </p><p>me more is the Chinese habit of indirection. </p><p>They won’t approach any subject in a </p><p>straight line. </p><p> “You heard the answers the boy gave you?</p><p>Neither one responsive. Ah, they’re diffi- </p><p>cult to understand—and crafty. But </p><p>there’s another characteristic—their super- </p><p>stition—that knocks their craftiness clean </p><p>out. We foreigners never will fathom the </p><p>Chinese well enough to beat them at all </p><p>points of the game, but we can always get </p><p>them on this weak spot—their superstition. </p><p>The Twelve Padlocks </p><p>177 </p><p>I happen to have a case in mind that fits </p><p>the theory-” </p><p> He paused to glance at me, apprehen-</p><p>sively. </p><p> “You’re not bored?” he asked. “So</p><p>many people out here are bored, you know. </p><p>One never knows. You’d rather not hear </p><p>me chattering?” </p><p> I could see that his inquiry was made not</p><p>so much with an eye to my real convenience </p><p>as to insure my attention. I gave him a </p><p>shake of the head, and he went on at once: </p><p> “I’m from inland, you know—and I must</p><p>talk. We chaps from up-river have to talk </p><p>to a white man occasionally or we’d go </p><p>insane. Think of it, man, months in a </p><p>reeking interior city, without railroads, </p><p>without electric lights, without any visible </p><p>reminder that you’re in the twentieth </p><p>century and not in the sixteenth. No white </p><p>face for months at a time. </p><p> “When we get a furlough—and the com-</p><p>pany’s none too generous on that score—it </p><p>usually comes just in time to save our </p><p>sanity. We take the first boat down-river </p><p>for the coast. Now here I am, just in an </p><p>hour ago on a steamer that carried four </p><p>hundred and seventy-five Chinese farmers, </p><p>their loquacious wives, their bleating goats, </p><p>their quacking ducks and their enormous </p><p>bundles. </p><p> “There was only one other white man on</p><p>board, and we talked each other completely </p><p>out. We probably would have done some </p><p>mutual knifing over our own beer in another </p><p>night on board. And now that I’m here I’ve </p><p>got to talk to some one—to a white man. </p><p>That’s what I’ve come eight hundred miles </p><p>for, after a penal servitude, or solitude, of </p><p>eight months. </p><p> “But I started to tell you about these</p><p>crafty Chinese. Their only weak point is </p><p>their superstition, I maintain, and that’s </p><p>how a clever white man can get the best of </p><p>them. This case I have in mind is a queer </p><p>one. A fiction writer might make it into a </p><p>story. He could call it ‘The Twelve Pad- </p><p>locks.’ It’s about a friend of mine—we’ll</p><p>call him Andrews—and a bunch of very </p><p>clever but very old-fashioned Chinese </p><p>merchants. I believe there was even a </p><p>magistrate among them. It can’t do </p><p>Andrews any harm to tell you this, even </p><p>though he’s an American and you are in the </p><p>consular service. </p><p> “Oh, I don’t need to be told that—I</p><p>would have guessed it even if the No. 1 boy </p><p>12 </p><p>here hadn’t told me. But the case probably </p><p>hasn’t been brought to your attention. It </p><p>probably won’t be. The crafty old Chinks </p><p>that lost their four hundred thousand dol- </p><p>lars to this Andrews chap aren’t going to </p><p>lose a million dollars’ worth of ‘face’ by </p><p>taking their troubles to the American con- </p><p>sular service. </p><p> “I suppose you’ve been out here long</p><p>enough to discover how suspicious and dis- </p><p>trustful the Chinese are. No one really </p><p>trusts anybody. The son mistrusts his </p><p>father, and father suspects son. Business </p><p>partners don’t trust one another. Of course </p><p>this characteristic is being modified con- </p><p>siderably in the treaty ports where the </p><p>Chinese come in business contact with </p><p>foreigners; that’s evident from the growth </p><p>of the native banking business. But there </p><p>are still big communities in China that </p><p>won't keep their money in a bank. </p><p> “This was the case with the merchants in</p><p>a walled city where Andrews was stationed </p><p>by his company—British-American tobacco, </p><p>you may have guessed. There was a big </p><p>Chinese hong there—pottery firm—that </p><p>must have had an annual income of half a </p><p>million. Do you suppose the directors </p><p>would do business with a bank? They </p><p>would not! The twelve fat, whiskered, </p><p>silk-coated old rascals kept the company </p><p>funds in a huge iron box locked with </p><p>twelve old-fashioned padlocks. Each had </p><p>his own padlock, and business couldn’t </p><p>be transacted unless all twelve were present </p><p>to perform the rite of opening the safe.” </p><p> I had mellowed a bit toward the stranger,</p><p>or rather, I had become resigned to him. </p><p>At this point I even asked some more or less </p><p>intellingent question by way of expressing </p><p>interest. </p><p> “I suppose,” he explained, “it’s a good</p><p>deal like this: these twelve old boys were </p><p>all honest enough—with one another. </p><p>They must have been or they wouldn’t </p><p>have hung together for so long. But the </p><p>collection of padlocks was designed not so </p><p>much for protection against one another </p><p>as for protection to themselves from all </p><p>suspicion of dishonesty. </p><p> “In a country where every one suspects</p><p>some one, it is necessary to take even such </p><p>a ridiculous precaution as that to avoid the </p><p>finger of suspicion. If the safe was robbed, </p><p>they figured, no one of them could be </p><p>blamed, since it would have required all </p><p>twelve to get it open. </p><p>i78 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>“ANDREWS shared warehouse </p><p>space with the pottery hong. In </p><p>fact his offices were practically iden- </p><p>tical with those of the Chinese outfit. The </p><p>big iron box with the twelve padlocks stood </p><p>in a room where it was always visible to </p><p>Andrews. It was so large—so he told me— </p><p>that the room must have been built around </p><p>it. The door was not large enough to have </p><p>let it through. </p><p> “No great attention was given to guard-</p><p>ing this treasury. There were watchmen </p><p>on duty at the warehouse, but I fancy the </p><p>twelve directors put their faith largely in </p><p>the great strength of the box, and in the </p><p>imposing cluster of padlocks. </p><p> “I’d better tell you something about this</p><p>Andrews, I guess. Can’t do him any harm, </p><p>because Andrews is not his real name and </p><p>there’s probably lots of salt water by this </p><p>time between China and the place where </p><p>he’s enjoying that cool four hundred thou- </p><p>sand. Andrews was a reformed yeggman. </p><p>You’ll agree with me such a thing is </p><p>possible? Not the ordinary sort—don’t </p><p>think of him as the lingo-talking jailbird </p><p>kind you read of in the fiction. </p><p> “He had an education. And what he</p><p>didn’t get in school he got from a woman—a </p><p>decent woman. What put him into the </p><p>yegg business there’s no good asking. </p><p>Probably he’s not telling. Why should he? </p><p>He ‘worked’ mostly along the California </p><p>coast. The San Francisco police would re- </p><p>member him yet for several little jobs </p><p>they’ve never been able to clean up. But </p><p>Andrews squared for them in a way by get- </p><p>ting into a uniform in the Spanish-Amer- </p><p>ican war. He served in the Philippine </p><p>insurrection, and later in the Constab- </p><p>ulary. </p><p> “Then he drifted about the China coast</p><p>for a while in various more or less respect- </p><p>able occupations—all of them, at any rate, </p><p>just short of his old vocation of lock pick- </p><p>ing. There were times when he might have </p><p>gone back to it, but he managed to stick his </p><p>reform resolution out. </p><p> “Well, you can see what a trial that old</p><p>iron box in the pottery hong was for An-</p><p>drews. It offered so easy a job it was </p><p>ridiculous. In twenty minutes he could </p><p>have filed a master key that would unlock </p><p>all twelve padlocks. He hadn’t cracked a </p><p>safe in a mighty long time, and his ethics </p><p>were pretty good, but that strong box was </p><p>a cruel temptation. He wavered many a </p><p>time, and twice he filed keys that would </p><p>have done the job. </p><p> “Once he went so far as to open the box,</p><p>while the Chinese watchman dozed outside </p><p>in the compound. He fingered the packets </p><p>of Chinese bank-notes. Curiously, these old </p><p>merchants pinned their faith to banking </p><p>currency though they avoided the banks as </p><p>depositaries. Two things at first helped </p><p>Andrews over the temptation: genuine </p><p>honesty, and a bit of wholesome fear. On </p><p>the one hand the habits of his recent years </p><p>of semi-decency held him back, and on the </p><p>other hand his knowledge of how difficult </p><p>it would be for him to get away with his </p><p>booty. </p><p> “There were several hundred miles of</p><p>slow river travel between him and the coast. </p><p>His sudden departure would put him under </p><p>suspicion, and concealment of the money </p><p>would be next to impossible. Nothing can </p><p>be concealed among the Chinese. There </p><p>are no secrets. If he should carry off the </p><p>contents of the box the robbery would be </p><p>discovered a few hours afterward, when </p><p>the directors gathered for the daily cere- </p><p>mony of removing the twelve padlocks. </p><p>Then the hue and cry would be down upon </p><p>him. </p><p> “Andrews used to tell me how comical</p><p>it was to watch the twelve directors </p><p>assemble for the unlocking ritual. It </p><p>was better than anything he’d ever seen </p><p>in comic opera. But its very openness— </p><p>its childish simplicity—seemed to be the </p><p>greatest security of the strong-box system. </p><p>A Chinese yeggman might have been equal </p><p>to the situation, but Andrews wasn’t. </p><p> “But by and by there came a sudden</p><p>event that made it very easy for Andrews </p><p>to fall. One of the twelve directors died. </p><p>Custom decreed that a new director could </p><p>not be elected until after the funeral of </p><p>the deceased. It was the superstition </p><p>that if the deceased’s key should be used</p><p>before the formal election of a successor </p><p>the spirit of the dead man would be jealous </p><p>and cause the user’s death. Do you see </p><p>how it was? The strong-box, on that </p><p>account, had to remain closed, and business </p><p>be hanged, until after the funeral. </p><p> “No man could possibly be found—least</p><p>of all among the directors—who would </p><p>have braved the superstition of meeting </p><p>death if he grated the dead man’s key </p><p>in its padlock. The best the directors </p><p>could do would be to consult the Taoist </p><p>The Twelve Padlocks </p><p>179 </p><p>priests and bribe them into picking an </p><p>early ‘auspicious date’ for the funeral. </p><p>You know how those things are arranged. </p><p>The priests, if they were greedy enough, </p><p>might hold them up for many days before </p><p>they completely exhausted the directors’ </p><p>patience. </p><p> “Andrews knew all this, and he wasted</p><p>no time in listening to his conscience. </p><p>The funeral, he figured, couldn’t take place </p><p>decently inside of two weeks. Robbery </p><p>of the strong-box, therefore, couldn’t be </p><p>discovered until after the thief was too far </p><p>away to give chase. </p><p> “Well, to be brief about how the affair</p><p>turned out, the doubled guard posted </p><p>that night at the warehouse saluted him </p><p>respectfully and without suspicion as he </p><p>left late in the evening after burning much </p><p>kerosene over ostensible office work. Care- </p><p>lessly protruding from under his desk was </p><p>a suitcase into which he had transferred </p><p>all the portable valuables in the iron </p><p>strong-box. He left thet welve ridiculous </p><p>padlocks dangling from the bolt of the big </p><p>safe, just as if they never had been touched. </p><p> “Two days later,, while the eleven sur-</p><p>viving directors were still engaged in </p><p>frantic negotiations with the Taoist priests </p><p>for the setting of a date for the funeral, </p><p>Andrews pulled the suitcase from under his </p><p>desk and boarded a river steamer for </p><p>Shanghai. </p><p> “Of course I’ve never heard the end of</p><p>the story. We can only imagine that. </p><p> “Picture the old silk-capped pottery mer-</p><p>chants escorting to the strong-box with </p><p>its silly padlocks their newly-elected asso- </p><p>ciate, entrusted legally with the deceased’s </p><p>key. Imagine them opening it up and </p><p>finding nothing inside but a few bars of </p><p>silver too heavy for Andrews to pack away. </p><p>Delicate, isn’t it?” </p><p> The stranger chuckled at this thought.</p><p>He seemed tremendously pleased—more </p><p>so than he ought, I reflected—over this </p><p>moral lapse of his friend. For my part </p><p>.1 could see nothing extraordinarily clever </p><p>in Andrews’ coup. It was very simple,</p><p>I thought, and said so. </p><p> The stranger was silent for a moment,</p><p>regarding me anxiously. He wore the </p><p>expression of a child that has been cutting </p><p>capers for admiring applause only to </p><p>receive the reproving and unflattering </p><p>glances of his elders. Before he could </p><p>reply a Hawaiian orchestra struck up one </p><p>of the plaintive tropic-island melodies, </p><p>and my companion directed his attention </p><p>eagerly to the performance. A look of </p><p>unmistakable nostalgia came into his face </p><p>as he listened. </p><p> “That music has a great effect on me,”</p><p>he remarked when the orchestra had </p><p>finished. “It always makes me homesick. </p><p>I’ve seen a good deal of the islands, coming </p><p>and going. They’ve come to mean some- </p><p>thing peculiarly like home to me, though </p><p>I’ve never lived there. I suppose it's </p><p>the sort of homey melody of the Hawaiian </p><p>songs that does it. They make you think </p><p>of old times and old places. How does </p><p>the poetry go, about that ‘Old unhappy </p><p>far-off things, and memories long ago?’ </p><p>That isn’t correct, I know, but that’s the </p><p>general idea. Have you ever felt that </p><p>way?” </p><p> He enlarged on this point almost to the</p><p>degree of irrelevance, and then suddenly </p><p>reverted to the padlocks. </p><p> “What do you think—tell me frankly,”</p><p>he asked, “of Andrews’ little stunt? Do </p><p>you blame the poor fool very much? </p><p>Remember all I’ve told you about him. </p><p>There he was, marooned among a lot of </p><p>yellow aliens, thousands of miles from </p><p>home—if he had any place he could call </p><p>homeland that’s it, you see—he was only </p><p>a poor bit of driftwood likely to end his </p><p>days with a touch of cholera or by means </p><p>of strong drink, in some odd corner of this </p><p>dirty old country. </p><p> “Do you blame him very much for falling</p><p>down on his good resolutions, for violating </p><p>the best traditions of the Service, and </p><p>taking a chance that would put him forever </p><p>beyond his miserable existence here? He </p><p>could go home, you see—probably has. </p><p>He could settle down to an honest life for </p><p>the rest of his days.” </p><p> “He could afford that,” I remarked, with</p><p>unnecessary dryness, I suppose. </p><p> “I guess you’re right. The poor fool</p><p>would never even be able to justify himself </p><p>to himself. He has been in the Service, </p><p>he’s been a soldier. You understand what </p><p>that means. And he’s had these few years </p><p>of honesty since then. All that would make </p><p>it hurt more. His conscience would be a </p><p>hell for him—it would be damnation. </p><p>And I suppose even now he has begun to </p><p>find his money a burden. </p><p> “He’ll be careless with it. He’ll gamble,</p><p>probably, and drink. That’s the worst </p><p>lt&gt;0 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>of it. He couldn’t enjoy it soberly. He’d </p><p>have to drink it up. Maybe something </p><p>worse—‘hop,’ for instance. It’s sure to </p><p>ruin him in the end. He’ll never get any </p><p>good out of it. The poor fool—the poor </p><p>imbecile.” </p><p>THE orchestra was playing again, </p><p>a medley of familiar home songs. </p><p>The stranger forgot his food in the </p><p>intensity of his listening. Then at the end </p><p>of the medley came a strain of “Dixie,” </p><p>and “The Star-Spangled Banner.” There </p><p>was only a bar of the latter, but with a </p><p>clatter the stranger got to his feet, standing </p><p>straight and grave until the notes of the </p><p>national anthem ceased. I stared at him, </p><p>scarcely comprehending at first. We </p><p>civilians, before the great war, were </p><p>insufferable clods in the matter of inatten- </p><p>ion to simple courtesies to the flag and </p><p>the national air. </p><p> Others were on their feet in the motley</p><p>assemblage that filled the cafe. It was a </p><p>good deal of an American rendezvous. </p><p>Among them was an officer of the Navy, </p><p>and with him a figure in khaki. The </p><p>stranger’s eyes rested on these men with a </p><p>proud glow. He made a half-movement </p><p>to approach them, then subsided into his </p><p>chair.	^</p><p> We said no more of Andrews, but talked</p><p>of things nearer to the hour and to his </p><p>starved interest. We left the cafe together, </p><p>almost as if we were old acquaintances. </p><p>My irascibility seemed to have vanished </p><p>under his dogged friendliness. I would </p><p>have taken him to the club, or to my rooms </p><p>for a cigar and a liqueur, but he seemed to </p><p>be in haste. Perhaps 1 only fancied it, </p><p>but his hurry seemed to be stimulated by </p><p>an incident at the door. </p><p> A well-dressed Chinese entered as we</p><p>came out, jostling clumsily against us. He </p><p>looked keenly at my companion—in fact </p><p>he stared. Apparently the Chinese fancied </p><p>an acquaintance which was not recognized </p><p>by the stranger, for he turned away and </p><p>stepping hastily into a rickshaw was </p><p>whirled away into the confusion of the </p><p>street. The Chinese called out to a man </p><p>waiting in the shadow of the doorway,</p><p>and after a moment of voluble instructions, </p><p>entered the cafe, leaving the other to dash </p><p>into the street in the direction taken by </p><p>the stranger’s rickshaw. </p><p> I suppose I spent the remainder of the</p><p>evening at the club. At any rate it was </p><p>late when I reached my rooms in the </p><p>consular building. I stumbled over a </p><p>suitcase that stood just inside the door. </p><p>Evidently it had been left there by mistake, </p><p>for it was not mine. It was closed but </p><p>not locked, and the catches seemed to invite </p><p>examination. Curiosity overwhelmed me. </p><p>I laid the suitcase open on a table, and for </p><p>a full minute stood whistling before its </p><p>contents. It was filled to the brim with </p><p>trim packets of Chinese bank-notes. </p><p> There was no name on the case, and I</p><p>could find no clue to the mystery of its </p><p>presence in my room. Was it unlikely </p><p>that this was the four-hundred-thousand- </p><p>dollar loot of the man Andrews? Still </p><p>further, was it unlikely that my dinner com- </p><p>panion at the cafe was himself this An- </p><p>drews? </p><p> I called my No. i boy. He shuffled his</p><p>way into the room, blinkingly, and pro- </p><p>fessed entire ignorance of the suitcase. </p><p>He roused all the servants, but they were </p><p>ignorant likewise. I gave them up in </p><p>exasperation. Doubtless some of them </p><p>knew all about it, but true to “character” </p><p>professed ignorance lest in some way they </p><p>should be involved in unpleasantness. It </p><p>was a sort of first cousin, I thought, to the </p><p>kind of suspicion that inspired the pad- </p><p>locks. </p><p> I pored over the contents of the suit-</p><p>case. Four hundred thousand dollars, </p><p>there was no doubt after a rough count, </p><p>lay before me. As I fingered the packets </p><p>I began a busy mental process of working </p><p>out an explanation. It seemed a reason- </p><p>able theory: that Andrews and the stranger </p><p>in the cafe were one and the same. But </p><p>could the presence of the suitcase here </p><p>mean a sort of repentance, a strange method </p><p>of reparation? What was I to infer? </p><p> Should I imply, that to me had been</p><p>intrusted the task of restoring the loot— </p><p>a task that probably might be both dan- </p><p>gerous and impossible to him? Or had he,</p><p>on the other hand, simply put the money </p><p>in my temporary keeping, intending to call </p><p>for it later? Perhaps he was the subject </p><p>of a pursuit—perhaps, in danger of capture </p><p>or detection, he adopted this fantastic </p><p>means of hiding his booty. In effect, then, </p><p>he made me an accomplice. Should I </p><p>accept such a role, or shoidd I return the </p><p>money at once to its owners? An inquiry </p><p>through the consular service doubtless </p><p>The Twelve Padlocks </p><p>181 </p><p>would discover for me who these owners </p><p>were. </p><p> On the whole I was inclined to the belief</p><p>that Andrews, repentant, had given me this </p><p>wordless, implied invitation to act as the </p><p>purifier of his conscience. </p><p> It was too late to trouble the consul.</p><p>It was too late even to carry the money </p><p>to a place of greater security. I deter- </p><p>mined to sleep with one eye open and </p><p>conceal the suitcase beneath the bed. </p><p> I slept well over so much treasure, but</p><p>with both eyes shut, it seems. In the </p><p>morning I found that even the cord with </p><p>which I had innocently tied the suitcase </p><p>to one of my hands had been snipped </p><p>without in the least distracting my slumber. </p><p>As for the suitcase, it was gone. </p><p> Of course I raged at the servants in a</p><p>thorough “foreign-devil” fashion. My </p><p>words were such as to express suspicion. </p><p>The servants grew very sad and patiently </p><p>indignant. I even went so far as to </p><p>threaten dismissal of them all, a thing </p><p>that did not seem remotely probable </p><p>either to me or to them. To dismiss </p><p>them undoubtedly would be to get a worse </p><p>set of servants; to keep them might </p><p>eventually be the means of solving the </p><p>riddle. </p><p> It did not appear to me, on reflection,</p><p>that there was anything in particular to be </p><p>done about the matter. I could only wait </p><p>further developments from some source </p><p>or other, probably from Andrews. If he </p><p>had meant to make me only a temporary </p><p>receiver for his loot he would be back again </p><p>for it. If he had intended its restoration </p><p>I probably would see no more of him. In </p><p>that case I was at something approaching </p><p>conscience-clear. But if he should return </p><p>demanding an accounting of my steward- </p><p>ship, what sort of conviction would my </p><p>explanation carry? Would he have his </p><p>revenge upon me? </p><p> It was not entirely in an easy frame of</p><p>mind that I dined that evening at my </p><p>accustomed table. The stranger was not </p><p>present. Nor did he appear while I was</p><p>there, though I loitered in the uneasy hope </p><p>of seeing him. </p><p> 1 had begun a stealthy investigation into</p><p>the truth of Andrews’ story. Through </p><p>means at my hand in the consular service </p><p>it seemed likely I should eventually learn </p><p>the remainder of the story of the twelve </p><p>padlocks. As an afterthought, when I </p><p>returned home that evening, I administered </p><p>a bribe to the No. i boy. It was not a large </p><p>bribe, and I should not have expected a </p><p>large return for it. In fact it brought only </p><p>another mystery—a pale one, scarcely rec- </p><p>ognizable at first as anything but accident. </p><p> While I dressed next morning I found on</p><p>my table a large iron key. It was of an </p><p>old-fashioned character, and bore the </p><p>curious trademark of some English maker. </p><p>I asked the room boy about it, but he was </p><p>able to express only a mild interest. He </p><p>either could not or would not venture an </p><p>opinion as to its origin or as to the reason </p><p>for its being there. </p><p> Doubtless I should have thought no</p><p>more about the key if another had not been </p><p>beside it when I arose on the following </p><p>morning. On the next morning there was </p><p>a third, and on each succeeding day an </p><p>addition, until I had half a pound or so of </p><p>the clumsy bits of steel and brass cluttering </p><p>my table. Once I bundled them up and </p><p>hurled them into the courtyard, exasperated </p><p>at the mystery they represented. The next </p><p>morning I was rewarded by finding them </p><p>all back again, with the usual addition. </p><p> Suddenly the collection ceased to grow.</p><p>And of a sudden, cursing myself for my </p><p>stupidity, a solution to the mystery of the </p><p>keys flashed upon me. I counted them, </p><p>and as I suspected, there were twelve. </p><p>Here, then were the keys to the twelve </p><p>padlocks! </p><p> But this far and no further would the</p><p>solution go. I had a daily desire to </p><p>commit medieval cruelties on my smiling </p><p>No. x boy, who I felt certain knew the </p><p>answer to the puzzle. I was torn between </p><p>this irritation and an impulse to meet his </p><p>undoubted terms—a handsome cumshaw. </p><p>Also I began to fear this crafty servant </p><p>somewhat. There was somewhere in all </p><p>this business of the keys and padlocks a</p><p>lurking menace—perhaps tragedy. </p><p> My inquiry through the consular service</p><p>yielded me nothing. I could not find even </p><p>the habitat of the twelve gray merchants </p><p>of the iron strong-box. Neither did I </p><p>encounter Andrews, nor could I find trace </p><p>of him among the numerous haunts of </p><p>white men in either the foreign or the </p><p>Chinese quarters. I found those who </p><p>knew him, but none who had seen him </p><p>recently. </p><p> At the offices of his firm they had no</p><p>knowledge of his arrival from up river. </p><p>182 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Doubtless, I thought, he had sailed away. </p><p>Fear might have sped him to this disappear- </p><p>ance, but I was inclined to stick to my </p><p>theory of an eleventh-hour repentance. </p><p>I had conceived a certain respect for him </p><p>that could not wholly be discounted by </p><p>his own recital of “Andrews’ ” moral lapse. </p><p>THE hot season was just coming </p><p>on, and I slipped away for a week </p><p>or two into the hills at Mokanshan. </p><p>When 1 returned 1 had almost forgotten the </p><p>mystery of the twelve keys. I was not </p><p>thinking of it, at least, on the morning I set </p><p>out on one of my numerous jade-collecting </p><p>excursions into the native city. For an </p><p>hour or more I browsed about among the </p><p>shops of a quarter with which I was familiar. </p><p> I was growing a bit tired of the heat, the</p><p>sweating coolies, the stench of sewage, and </p><p>the ruck of so much crowded, unlovely </p><p>humanity, and would have returned to a </p><p>comfortable lemonade and tiffin if it had </p><p>not been for the Chinese guide that stepped </p><p>up and wheedled me into following him to </p><p>a new jade shop of which I never had heard; </p><p>I followed him, though I did it reluctantly, </p><p>for he led me some distance beyond the </p><p>streets with which I was familiar. He was </p><p>a guide I did not recall seeing before, and </p><p>this did not reduce my reluctance. </p><p> We were jostled in the narrow thorough-</p><p>fares by shouting coolies, assailed by the </p><p>cries and stares of filthy street urchins, </p><p>and followed by the insistent choruses of </p><p>disease-scarred beggars. We passed down </p><p>a long shaded street of violin-makers, and </p><p>then delved into alleys broken by frequent </p><p>puzzling traverses designed to obfuscate </p><p>Chinese devils that can proceed only in </p><p>straight lines. At last we came to the </p><p>ocher-colored wall of a Chinese temple, </p><p>looking more ancient even than its un- </p><p>doubted years because of its leprous </p><p>splotches of saltpeter. </p><p> I was not surprised to have the guide</p><p>lead me inside the temple grounds, for </p><p>such inclosures usually are lined with shops, </p><p>but I was disturbed to find the temple yard </p><p>deserted. Weeds grew rankly between </p><p>the flagstones of the court, and the temple </p><p>buildings were in a state of unusual decay.</p><p>The sun beat down into this desolate </p><p>enclosure and the sounds of the teeming city </p><p>seemed suddenly remote. I had a feeling </p><p>of apprehension that made me clutch tenta- </p><p>tively at the little revolver I carried—quite </p><p>needlessly, my friends told me—on such </p><p>excursions. </p><p> The guide led me rapidly along the shaded</p><p>pavilion of vacant shop-fronts to an inner </p><p>court. Here was a slimy green basin that </p><p>doubtless once had boasted of being a lotus </p><p>pool. It seemed to be fed from the tide- </p><p>water overflow of a canal. The place </p><p>recked with heat and miasma. I felt sick </p><p>and dizzied by the frightful breath of </p><p>sewage, and the gusts of noon-day sunlight </p><p>reflected from the gray tiles of the temple </p><p>roofs. </p><p> The guide paused significantly, and I</p><p>followed his gaze to one end of the green </p><p>basin where there was visible, half in shade </p><p>and half in sunlight, the iron bars of a </p><p>curious enclosure. I moved nearer, in- </p><p>spired by a rising curiosity over something </p><p>that moved sluggishly behind those bars. </p><p>Not until I had gazed a full minute upon </p><p>the horrible creature visible there did the </p><p>meaning of the thing come to me. </p><p> I was stupefied by the filth that sur-</p><p>rounded him and made his features hideous; </p><p>by the uncomprehending look of senility </p><p>and disease in his vacant eyes; by frag- </p><p>ments of meaningless, parrot-like English </p><p>words that dropped from his imbecile lips. </p><p>The creature was the relic of Andrews, my </p><p>companion at the dinner-table. For that </p><p>he was Andrews I could no longer doubt </p><p>from the circumstance of the twelve ugly </p><p>padlocks that fastened the iron grate </p><p>behind which he rotted. </p><p> The guide disappeared, I found, as with</p><p>a murmur of rage—and I will not deny it: </p><p>of fear—I rushed back through the outer </p><p>courtyard, in mad haste to bring the keys </p><p>that would give liberty to poor Andrews. </p><p> He still is in the sanatorium in Japan</p><p>where his tobacco firm generously sent him, </p><p>but the doctors do not see great encourage- </p><p>ment for him. His eleventh-hour repent- </p><p>ance in the matter of the twelve padlocks </p><p>seems to have come—or at least so the </p><p>Chinese devils appear to have decreed it—</p><p>a moment or so too late. And I have an </p><p>idea that whatever devils were concerned </p><p>in the business of clouding his mind had </p><p>a fairly intimate working agreement with </p><p>the twelve crafty merchants whom Andrews </p><p>commiserated for their fatal superstitions. </p><p>wm </p><p> She CAMP FIRE</p><p>^ A Meeting-Place for </p><p>^Readers.Writers and </p><p>"Adveniurers * </p><p>/~\NLY those who don’t care for it claim </p><p>fishing is not adventure, yet both in </p><p>our stories and at our Camp-Fire there’s </p><p>been very little said about it. Now, how- </p><p>ever, Harold Titus raises a few points in </p><p>connection with his story in this issue that </p><p>may start something. </p><p> He is not fishing this season, however.</p><p>In the Army and trying hard to get to </p><p>France. Today also comes a letter from </p><p>Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur who, like his </p><p>collaborator, Farnham Bishop, after many </p><p>attempts and some special physical training, </p><p>has finally got into the Army, though not </p><p>so close to the front as he tried for. Roy P. </p><p>Churchill, also with a story in this issue, is </p><p>back in the sea service of his country, to- </p><p>day’s mail bringing word of his work. </p><p>HPHESE are only four out of many of </p><p>our writing comrades who are in our </p><p>country’s service. I often wonder how </p><p>we are able to go on getting stories up to </p><p>our standard in numbers sufficient to our </p><p>needs. On the face of things it looks im- </p><p>possible, but our magazine has been growing </p><p>not only in circulation but in the number </p><p>of writers who send us stories, enough, it </p><p>seems, to keep things nearly normal in spite </p><p>of the fact that our writers are particularly </p><p>of the type which furnishes men for war. </p><p>I have no facts for comparison but venture </p><p>that our writers have furnished an un- </p><p>usually high percentage of men in service. </p><p> A ND meanwhile here is that fishing story.</p><p>We have need, in these times of tension, </p><p>of amusements that temporarily relieve our </p><p>minds and nervous systems of the strain </p><p>under which labor all of us not too dull to </p><p>understand the world-crisis slowly develop- </p><p>ing day by day. That is why our magazine </p><p>is buying even fewer stories with the </p><p>atmosphere of the present war than for- </p><p>merly. So far as we can be of service, the </p><p>more closely we keep our minds on the war, </p><p>the„better. But when we have time for </p><p>deliberate relaxation and amusement the </p><p>more relief we get from the war-strain, the </p><p>better able we’ll be to carry our end of it </p><p>when we turn back from relaxation to work.</p><p> At our Camp-Fire it would be both</p><p>foolish and wrong to bar discussion of the </p><p>war, but we make up the magazine well </p><p>ahead, as you know, and events move too </p><p>rapidly for current topics to be still current </p><p>by the time written words have reached </p><p>you in print. What I’m writing now will </p><p>reach you in June, but I’m writing it in </p><p>April while all the world is trembling on </p><p>the issue of the great Hun offensive now </p><p>under way. Yet, though it’s hard to think </p><p>of anything else, there is nothing I can say </p><p>that would have any interest two months </p><p>from now. No man now knows whether </p><p>the Germans will be held and bled to death </p><p>or whether they will be able to pound their </p><p>way through to a victory that would damn </p><p>the world for generations and doom it to </p><p>years more of warfare, on our own soil as </p><p>well as on many other bloody fields. </p><p>Probably you will know when you read this. </p><p>No one knows now. What a vast gulf two </p><p>months can be! </p><p>A ND while destiny unfolds we must keep </p><p>our balance by meeting the strain </p><p>intelligently, working as long as we can work </p><p>effectively, resting and relaxing when we </p><p>need to rest and relax for the sake of the </p><p>work itself. So it is good to go fishing with </p><p>Harold Titus, forgetting war a while so </p><p>that we may come back rested, refreshed </p><p>and better able to do each his own part in </p><p>the grim task lying to our hands. As the </p><p>author of this story is himself doing. </p><p> I suppose my home town, Traverse City, Michi-</p><p>gan, is the “fishingest" place they could find with </p><p>a search warrant. We are located on some of the </p><p>best trout water east of the Rockies. In fact, the </p><p>Boardman River, which flows through the town </p><p>itself, has been one of the remarkable streams of </p><p>the Great Lakes country, and we are' within easy </p><p>184	Adventure</p><p>reach of innumerable rivers that offer splendid </p><p>sport. A big proportion of the population fishes, </p><p>too. I believe that some of the best fishermen </p><p>that ever wore waders call this particular place </p><p>home. You see, we have men here who have </p><p>followed the sport through all its phases from the </p><p>days when grayling were plentiful until now, </p><p>when those varieties of trout that will survive warm </p><p>waters are being planted in streams which drain </p><p>settled country to keep them from being fished out. </p><p>'T'HE catch which I describe in this story is one </p><p>which was made by my friend “Pat” Hastings, </p><p>who has hooked his share of ’em. It’s a dog-gone </p><p>good fish story (his, I mean) and may seem a bit </p><p>incredible to a novice who reads it, but I’ll vouch </p><p>for its adherence to fact. Two changes I must </p><p>mention, however; the first is that I have moved </p><p>the time of the catch forward three or four hours </p><p>for the purposes of the plot; the other is that the </p><p>fish actually taken was not quite as large as the </p><p>one in my yarn. Six-pounders and larger are taken </p><p>from this water occasionally, but a fact which I </p><p>have never had clearly explained is that these </p><p>big fish, caught after dark, do not fight with any- </p><p>where near the vigor they display when hooked </p><p>in daylight. </p><p> It is during the hatch of the caddis fly that the</p><p>big browns arc taken from the Boardman River </p><p>in the greatest numbers. The best water is within </p><p>fifteen minutes from town by automobile and each </p><p>evening during the hatcli of this insect you’ll see a </p><p>representative gathering of liars and fly-fishermen </p><p>strung out along the stream trying to get the big </p><p>one of the season. </p><p>'FHIS river, by the way, demonstrates what </p><p>can_ be done by restocking. To a large </p><p>extent it flows through relatively newly-settled </p><p>country. Fifteen or twenty years ago it was alive </p><p>with speckled trout, but as the timber was cut off, </p><p>the water warmed, and the number of fishermen </p><p>increased, these fish fell off. Rainbow were </p><p>planted and did fairly well but, even then, the </p><p>sport was mediocre. Then the State commenced </p><p>sending up German Brown spawn and now the </p><p>Boardman shows every sign of reviving and some </p><p>regular old-time catches were made last Summer. </p><p>We know that the speckled trout, like the grouse, </p><p>can not stand up under civilization. Many men </p><p>do not like the Rainbow, although it’s a sporty </p><p>fish. The Brown, however, is a noble fighter, good </p><p>to eat and seems to withstand the clearing up of </p><p>streams. Propagating this variety in quantities is </p><p>going to keep rivers stocked indefinitely, it seems. </p><p>(")NE attractive feature about this part of </p><p>Michigan is the diversity of water and country </p><p>offered. We have pond fishing in many places. </p><p>There are trout streams, like the Boardman, </p><p>almost in your dooryard. Again, given a Ford </p><p>and three hours, you can slrike streams like the </p><p>Manistee or the Au Sable (that last will take an </p><p>hour or so longer), which run through country as </p><p>desolate as any white man could ask for. The </p><p>upper waters of the Manistee are still well stocked </p><p>with speckled trout, than which no better fish ever </p><p>rose to a fly, and many other rivers still offer this </p><p>particular kind. The Rainbow predominates else- </p><p>where and the Brown is fast appearing in waters </p><p>hitherto strange to it. Another interesting fact </p><p>is that you can fish, say, one day in the little Platte </p><p>River where the speckled trout has a bright steel- </p><p>blue cast, the next in the Rapid where they color </p><p>a rich orange with lots of red on the fins and again </p><p>in streams farther to the eastward where they get </p><p>the pink tint on the belly. </p><p> Lots of bass, too, in this country, but most of the</p><p>natives go nutty over trout and the bulk of the </p><p>bass fishing is done by men who come especially </p><p>for it.—Harold Titus. </p><p>/^OD knows where Lieutenant Dwyer </p><p>will be by the time your answer to his </p><p>inquiry of January could reach him, but if </p><p>you know what he asks, write him in our </p><p>care and we’ll forward to the best of our </p><p>ability. He was in a U. S. camp when he </p><p>wrote. Perhaps it would be safer just to </p><p>print the answer in the magazine. </p><p> Wherever I have been among tropical tramps</p><p>there is one poem always known. It begins thus: </p><p> “So, so, you’re come to the tropics.</p><p> Thought all that you had to do</p><p> Was to be in the shade in a coconut glade,</p><p> While the dollars rolled in to you.</p><p>and ends: </p><p> “You don’t go down with a short, hard fall;</p><p> You just sort of shuffle along</p><p> And lighten your load of the moral code,</p><p> Till you don’t know the right from the wrong</p><p> Could you not reprint it; or tell where the entire</p><p>thing may be obtained?—Richard M. Dwyer, </p><p>First Lieut., - Infantry.</p><p>NOT the least interesting part of Hugh </p><p>Pendexter’s stories about our old </p><p>Indian frontier days is the little chat from </p><p>him at Camp-Fire concerning the history </p><p>and real Indian customs upon which all his </p><p>tales are based: </p><p>Norway, Maine. </p><p> The Skidi, a tribe of the Pawnee confederacy,</p><p>believed in supernatural animals and located their </p><p>underground dwellings, or Nahurac lodges, in the </p><p>valley of the Loup River, Nebraska. In this belief </p><p>of mythic animals holding councils they will remind </p><p>you of the Cherokee myths. Guide Rock in </p><p>Kansas was another Nahurac lodge. </p><p>TX7HEN the Siouan tribes entered the Platte </p><p>valley they found the Pawnee there. Hara- </p><p>hey was the name of the province which the Pawnee </p><p>told Coronado contained much gold, the Wichita </p><p>country of east-central Kansas. The confederacy </p><p>had no totems and descent was traced through </p><p>the mother. Each tribe had several secret societies, </p><p>each based on the belief in supernatural animals. </p><p>One writer gives the time of the last Skidi sacrifice </p><p>of a human being as 1838. During the first quarter </p><p>of the nineteenth century Petalesharo, a Skidi </p><p>chief, rescued a Comanche woman, who was bound </p><p>to a cross preliminary to being sacrificed, and </p><p>The Camp-Fire	185</p><p>carried her back to her people, some four hundred </p><p>miles. This chief was one of the signers of the </p><p>treaty at Grand Pa\&lt;mee Village on the Platte in </p><p>Nebraska, October 9, 1833, by the terms of which </p><p>they ceded all their lands to the United States </p><p>south of the Platte River. One authority (Powell) </p><p>states they were least understood of any of the </p><p>important plains Indians, and this, perhaps, </p><p>because during the seventeenth and the greater </p><p>part of the eighteenth centuries they remained </p><p>outside the Spanish-French sphere of influence. </p><p>Their prowess as warriors is established by their </p><p>successful warfare against the many surrounding </p><p>tribes.—Pendexter. </p><p>WHEN we read “On Short Allowance” </p><p>I queried Mr. Pladwell about several </p><p>points in it in order to be on the safe side, </p><p>as we often do on our stories. My queries </p><p>are of no present interest, but Mr. Plad- </p><p>well’s reply to them is worth listening to. </p><p>The queries can be gathered from the </p><p>context; they were intended to make sure </p><p>of points that might disturb the average </p><p>reader, not as comments from one wise in </p><p>all the technicalities of nautical lore: </p><p>Oakland, California. </p><p> In the first place, the story was a growth of a</p><p>query. I saw some rotting tubs in Oakland </p><p>estuary. I wondered what might happen if one </p><p>of them took a long trip. I got some yams from </p><p>old salts hereabouts, and gradually I evolved the </p><p>yarn, pieced out of the other yams. Then when </p><p>it was finished I took it to some of the veteran </p><p>mariners. I have mucked around the water a lot </p><p>myself, but never on a three-masted schooner. So </p><p>I needed criticism. </p><p> The mariners helped me much, and yet not one</p><p>of them saw the points that you saw. They are, </p><p>I think, debatable. </p><p>VOU will note on the map the long series of </p><p>islands of the Aleutian group, stretching </p><p>across the north Pacific. These islands as a </p><p>general rule comprise the northernmost Ixmndaries </p><p>of the average sailing-ship course across Uie western </p><p>ocean. Sometimes prevalent winds drive the </p><p>windjammers very dose to the Aleutians, often </p><p>in sight of them. The Aleutians are bare, bleak </p><p>islands, populated by sea-fowl, Aleuts, beach- </p><p>combers, seals, and occasional wanderers. Many </p><p>a ship’s crew has deserted to take a chance on </p><p>picking up seal illegally around these islands, and </p><p>while there is not a real settlement on any of the</p><p>islands except, I think, one lone mission church, </p><p>a crew getting there in a small boat has easy chances </p><p>for survival and, possibly, for profit. </p><p>FOR willingness to try such an alternative. </p><p>The schooner in the story is cheap. The food </p><p>is awful. The master is a martinet. The men are </p><p>scum, with not a first or second class seaman </p><p>among them. A few days of cheap food and un- </p><p>welcome work is enough to make such a collection </p><p>of men, I think, willing to take a chance, especially </p><p>when a glib-tongued person is stirring up trouble </p><p>and putting ideas in the men’s heads. To make </p><p>it more logical I might have put in something saying </p><p>Big Frank had hinted at seal-poaching; but as I </p><p>said, the mariners who saw the story took tliis </p><p>desertion so much as a matter of course that it is </p><p>safe to assume there is nothing new about leaving </p><p>a cheap ship for the thrills of the islands’ chances. </p><p>QFTEN in the dreary reaches of the night one </p><p>can find helmsmen dozing at the wheel when </p><p>the weather is calm. Why not? There is something </p><p>about the sleep of a man on the job that does not </p><p>let him make many bad slips. I have often dozed </p><p>myself at the tiller or the wheel, but the instant </p><p>the boat slewed off her course I set her right auto- </p><p>matically. She can not fall off very badly without </p><p>your knowing it. The motion of the ship tells you. </p><p>Now, in the story the crew is desperately short- </p><p>handed. In such a case it would be peculiar, </p><p>perhaps, if the helmsman were not taking a cat- </p><p>nap, especially with the weather calm. At least, </p><p>he might not be wide-awake enough to observe a </p><p>man sneaking up a hatchway from the after-cabin. </p><p>On a liner, a tramp or a big four-master such a thing </p><p>as a sleeping helmsman might be serious, but not </p><p>on that old tub. </p><p>~pVKN on the old scows sailing around San </p><p>Francisco Bay the master’s lone helper uses </p><p>the “sir” to the blowsy old bird who happens to </p><p>run the tiling. But there again my story skids </p><p>off the usual. With so much to contend with, </p><p>could the average master induce such a crew of </p><p>landsmen to observe this matter without possibly </p><p>starting more grief aboard? They are landsmen, </p><p>not sailor-men. And yet, toward the end of the </p><p>voyage, I think he would. I believe that a few </p><p>“sirs” might not hurt the story. And yet I’ve seen </p><p>a drill sergeant in the United States Army work </p><p>three weeks to make a bunch of rookies say “sir." </p><p>It’s the hardest word in the United States language. </p><p>I think.—E. S. Pladwell. </p><p>ONE of our comrades at the Camp- </p><p>Fire, one of the writers of our</p><p>stories, will no longer gather with </p><p>us at our meetings. William A. Shryer is </p><p>dead and I know that our sympathy goes </p><p>out to the wife and little son he has left </p><p>behind him. </p><p> Born in Terre Haute, Indiana, Mr. Shryer</p><p>has made his home in Detroit. Well </p><p>known as a writer on business subjects, he </p><p>was equally successful with fiction and it </p><p>was in the quest for material for future </p><p>stories that he met his death. The news </p><p>came to me from Honolulu, following by a </p><p>few weeks a cheerful letter from him en- </p><p>closing a newspaper clipping telling of a bad </p><p>fall he had had in the crater of the volcano. </p><p>March tenth he had preceded his family to </p><p>a temporary home taken on the Glenwood- </p><p>Volcano Road, met them at Hilo and on </p><p>the return trip met his death in an auto- </p><p>mobile accident due to a nut that had </p><p>worked loose in the steering gear, sending </p><p>the car over a sixteen-foot embankment. </p><p>Adventure </p><p> His wife and their Japanese maid were</p><p>severely injured, the boy escaping unhurt. </p><p>Mr. Shryer’s neck was broken and he lived </p><p>only long enough to tell his wife that he was </p><p>“done for.” The body was brought to </p><p>Honolulu from Hilo on the Mauna Kea and </p><p>was cremated. </p><p> Let us stand and salute him, our comrade,</p><p>for a life bravely lived, then wish him God- </p><p>speed on the Long Trail over which we all </p><p>will follow. </p><p>LOUIS ESSON, whose tale, “The Pearl </p><p>J of Torres,” you will find in this issue, </p><p>introduces himself to the Camp-Fire ac- </p><p>cording to our custom: </p><p> Most Australians are wanderers and adventurers.</p><p>This roving spirit is a racial characteristic; for if </p><p>their forebears had not possessed it there would </p><p>never have been any Australia. All my prople are </p><p>Scottish; but, though I was bom in Edinburgh, I </p><p>was taken to Australia as a child, and my first </p><p>memories are of the Big Bush, an ideal playground </p><p>for boys. There is an abiding fascination in the </p><p>life of the Bush, with its great spaces, its sheep and </p><p>cattle, and the quaint characters that meet in the </p><p>township on market day, or for some great sporting </p><p>event—a wood chop or race meeting. </p><p>T DUTIFULLY did an Arts course at the </p><p> Melbourne University, studying Latin and</p><p>Philosophy; but this brought me little credit with </p><p>Billy Smith, the stockman, who refused to take me </p><p>seriously at cattle droving, or even riding—-subjects </p><p>unfortunately not included in my academic cur- </p><p>riculum. I wasn’t up to the bushman’s standard, </p><p>so 1 drifted into journalism; thence the easy </p><p>descent! </p><p> I have written for most Australian papers and</p><p>magazines and worked for a year in London, beside </p><p>publishing a volume of verse and having a play </p><p>produced in Melbourne; but my best performance </p><p>in this line was editing a little daily newspaper on </p><p>tie edge of beyond. Strange types would drop </p><p>into the office—-we called it “the office”—drovers </p><p>and shearers setting out for far back stations, </p><p>miners from the coal fields, selectors and cockatoo </p><p>farmers, politicians, and what is called the “scrub </p><p>aristocracy.” It was an exciting life, especially </p><p>when the worthy president of a wayback agricultural </p><p>society dropped in to interview the staff with a </p><p>horsewhip. 1 usually referred him to the manager, </p><p>a burly man who had been an amateur pugilist in</p><p>his early days. </p><p>T ATER on journalism sent me to Asia where </p><p>I had my fair share of adventure, wandering </p><p>through many fascinating lands from Ceylon to </p><p>Japan. I have seen the dawn rise near Darjeeling </p><p>over the sacred Katchenjunga; I have been turned </p><p>back from the Khyber Pass, for my own good; </p><p>I have been in Peshawar after a raid by the Afridis </p><p>and I have seen the beggars and j'ogis ’round the </p><p>temples at Benares, the sacred cows and monkeys, </p><p>and the burning of a body at the burning Ghat by </p><p>the Ganges. </p><p> Once I traveled from Moulmein to Bangkok</p><p>through Burma and Siam. My traveling com- </p><p>panion, a forest officer who was going northwards, </p><p>left me in the middle of Siam. With much diffi- </p><p>culty I obtained a boat and a Lao crew who prom- </p><p>ised to take me down the Menam to Paknam-Po. </p><p>This was a terrible journey. None of the crew </p><p>could speak a word of English, and river traveling </p><p>was slow. Stores ran out, and for three days there </p><p>was no food except what the Laos had—gigantic </p><p>bananas, rice suitable perhaps for elephants, frogs </p><p>and larvae of bees—impossible, even curried. At </p><p>Paknam-Po I discovered a friendly Englishman </p><p>who put on a dinner that would have done no dis- </p><p>credit to Delmonico’s. </p><p>Jyf ANY Australian journalists are scattered along </p><p>the Asiatic coast from Singapore to Yoko- </p><p>hama. Among others I met at Hong-Kong Pratt, </p><p>who has since drifted to Bangkok, and Donald, </p><p>now representing a New York newspaper, both </p><p>acknowledged authorities on Asiatic affairs. </p><p> All Australians are deeply concerned in the fate</p><p>of the Northern Territory that lies close to Asia, </p><p>and is perhaps the largest unoccupied territory </p><p>in the world today. This is our land of romance, </p><p>a land of pearl and gold, of the mirage, of our </p><p>strange aboriginals, a more interesting race than </p><p>is usually supposed, and of the great bushmen and </p><p>adventurers from all the ends of the earth. My </p><p>half-brother, Frank Brown, at present in Meso- </p><p>potamia chasing Turks, has been thrice through </p><p>the Territory, studying the elaborate native customs </p><p>and making explorations in uncharted country. </p><p>I have been through it only once, but 1 can never </p><p>forget its subtle spell. </p><p>VET, after all, there is always romance at home. </p><p> Before going to New York and London I</p><p>spent two years in a cottage only forty miles from </p><p>Melbourne. But the little clearing was cut out </p><p>of the virgin forest, huge fallen trees and stumps</p><p>were ’round our door, and down by the creek an </p><p>old man, the last of the fossickcrs, was still puddling </p><p>for gold. This Bush homestead is at present </p><p>occupied by Vance Palmer, who is not unknown </p><p>to readers of Adventure.—Louis Esson. </p><p>T&gt; Y THIS time—I am writing in May— </p><p>I had expected to report considerable </p><p>progress by the American League for citi- </p><p>zenship, Inc., but I’ve been ill during most </p><p>of 19x8 so far and not able to be on my </p><p>regular job all the time, so work on the </p><p>League has had to tread water. </p><p> But the prospects are promising, and I</p><p>expect to have things moving before long. </p><p>It wa^ never intended that they should </p><p>move rapidly.

We hope you will be patient if their answers are at </p><p>times delayed: Capt.-Adj. Joseph Mills uanson; Capt. A. A/. Lochwitsky. </p><p>Employment in India </p><p> Question:—“I am interested in India, Burma</p><p>and Tibet. Can you give me some information on </p><p>Darjeeling? Can you give me the name of a news- </p><p>paper there? </p><p> “I am 36 years old, strong, and not afraid of work.</p><p>My line is electricity and machinery—over 15 years’ </p><p>experience. Am total abstainer from liquor and </p><p>tobacco and can furnish the best of references. My </p><p>family—my mother, sister and myself—wish above </p><p>all else to live in a country where we can at least </p><p>keep one servant without paying out one’s whole </p><p>salary to do so. </p><p> “I understand that employment is difficult to</p><p>secure in the Far East and that caste conditions </p><p>make it impossible for a man to work his way up </p><p>from a minor job. I appreciate that Ask Adventure </p><p>is no employment agency but I thought perhaps you </p><p>might know the names of some firms operating in </p><p>those parts. </p><p> “I will gladly pay you for any information locating</p><p>us in India. We greatly prefer Northern India, but </p><p>if we can't get there now, are going to try Hawaii or </p><p>Japan on account of the servant problem until we </p><p>can get to India.”- -, Cheyenne, </p><p>Wyoming. </p><p> Answer, by Gordon McCreagh:—Your letter is</p><p>one of the very few which I have received, in reply </p><p>to which I can give some encouragement about em- </p><p>ployment in India.</p><p> As an electrician and machinist I feel safe in as-</p><p>suring you that you certainly could find employ- </p><p>ment with one of the big engineering firms on a </p><p>salary commencing with about two hundred and </p><p>fifty rupees a month—say eighty-five dollars. This </p><p>sounds frightfully small, but I’m setting a low esti- </p><p>mate, and the buying power of the rupee in India is </p><p>a whole heap more than the dollar here. On two </p><p>hundred and fifty rupees you could live with your </p><p>mother and sister reasonably well and keep three or </p><p>four servants—you would have to keep at least that </p><p>number because caste laws restrict the duties of each </p><p>servant to very definite bounds. </p><p> I am sure you would have no trouble in getting</p><p>employment; but you must, of course, be prepared </p><p>to wait a while till you can locate yourself. With </p><p>your qualifications, a couple of months at the out- </p><p>side should see you comfortably settled. </p><p> Now about Darjeeling. It’s a fine place with a</p><p>splendid climate, considerably milder both ways </p><p>than New York. Situated 7,500 feet above sea </p><p>level, it is a sanitarium city for the wom-out business </p><p>men and their families from the tropical plains. </p><p>You will find there department stores, theaters, and </p><p>high rents. But, you will not find there a job. Not </p><p>Adventure </p><p> 190</p><p> right away, at any rate. The reason being that it</p><p> is such a paradise spot—for India—that every</p><p> man in the country spends all his spare time trying</p><p> to land there—and the town isn’t so large that jobs</p><p> are many. By large, I mean commercially large;</p><p> there are no mills or manufacturing plants.</p><p> Your one chance might be in tea. Tea planta-</p><p> tions spread in all directions along the mountain</p><p> slopes, and they employ one or more while men each</p><p> who must have a knowledge of machinery in addi-</p><p> tion to a knowledge of tea. You might get in as an</p><p> assistant manager on some garden. But pay and</p><p> prospects wouldn’t appeal to you for a minute. An</p><p> assistant gets about a hundred rupees a month and</p><p> house.</p><p> As to a newspaper. I don’t know how a paper</p><p> will help you, and I don’t know that I can give you</p><p> the name of one. There used to be a small local</p><p> sheet called the Darjeeling Standard; but I heard</p><p> that the war had put it on the fritz. People read</p><p> one of the big Calcutta dailies, The Englishman, or</p><p> The Statesman.</p><p> It seems to me that your best course would be to</p><p> ship for Calcutta, which is the big manufacturing</p><p> center of the country, and then look around there.</p><p> With your qualifications you should land a job</p><p> without any difficulty, particularly since men are</p><p> scarce right now.</p><p> The wise thing to do would be to leave your folks</p><p> at home, if you can manage it, and have them come</p><p> over when you have a job and a little bungalow to</p><p> bring them to. The journey is nothing for two</p><p> ladies alone to be frightened at. Many hundreds</p><p> \ of English ladies do it every year, and for just the</p><p> same reason; their men folks have gone on ahead to</p><p> • get things started.</p><p> If you are not particularly struck on India, let me</p><p> suggest Burma to you as a field for your future.</p><p> Rangoon, the capital is only three days’ sail from</p><p> Calcutta, and, while the opportunities for employ-</p><p> ment are not quite so great as in Calcutta, the scale</p><p> of pay is a half as much again, and you will find the</p><p> people very much pleasanter to get along with.</p><p> The natives are a vastly more decent race and there</p><p> is considerably less social snobbery among the</p><p> English residents.</p><p> Burma is a tremendous country and a growing</p><p> one. There are oil and lumber and mining com-</p><p> panies all of which could use a practical electrician.</p><p> It is worth looking at, and the steamer fare from</p><p> Calcutta is only about fifteen dollars.</p><p> Regarding your offer of payment for information—</p><p> this Ask Adventure service is entirely free; and</p><p> Adventure Magazine is always pleased to have been</p><p> able to be of assistance to its readers. If you feel</p><p> that you want to express your appreciation, why,</p><p> pass the good word along to the next guy.</p><p>School-Ships </p><p> Question:—“I am interested in seafaring life, and</p><p> very anxious to learn navigation. I have heard</p><p> that there are school-ships that teach this, and</p><p> would like to know the names and locations of</p><p> these ships, and rules, regulations and conditions</p><p> for entering them.”—F. J. Shymkus, East St.</p><p> Louis, 111.</p><p> Answer, by Captain Dingle:—The schools for</p><p> merchant marine officers are scattered up and</p><p> down the coast, and all are under the supervision</p><p>of Mr. Henry Howard, Director of Recruiting, </p><p>Custom House, Boston, Massachusetts. </p><p> From him you can obtain full information.</p><p> There was a rule at first which demanded actual</p><p>sea experience in an applicant; but I believe this </p><p>has been waived, at least in part, and if you write </p><p>to Mr. Howard, giving particulars of yourself, age, </p><p>physical condition, degree of education, and so </p><p>forth, you may be able to enroll without previous </p><p>service. </p><p> Failing this, you might apply to the Navy De-</p><p>partment at Washington for the addresses of the </p><p>various school-ships taking cadets or apprentices. </p><p>There is one here, the Newport, and you can also </p><p>apply to the commander of her, North River, New </p><p>York. </p><p> In these school-ships young fellows are taken in</p><p>the raw, and trained completely to be officers in a </p><p>real ship under sea conditions. </p><p> If you fail on all counts write me again. But I</p><p>think you can get along with this brief information </p><p>if you try. _ </p><p>The Grand Canon of Arizona </p><p> Question:—“Can you give me any information as</p><p>to Aztec ruins in the Grand Canon of Arizona? I </p><p>have heard that their old sacred relics were hid in </p><p>there. Is there any authentic source to this rumor?</p><p>Has the canon ever been thoroughly explored? If </p><p>so, were any minerals found, such as copper, gold, </p><p>silver, vanadium asbestos? What is known alx&gt;ut </p><p>minerals in or near the canon? What kind of </p><p>game and fish? What is the altitude of the moun- </p><p>tains there? What is the general formation— </p><p>granite, limestone, basalt or lava? Volcanic or </p><p>layer deposit?”—Allen Peeler, Dolores, Colo. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Harriman:—There are cliff-</p><p>dwellings in the Grand Canon of the Colorado at </p><p>one point, but we do not know that the cliff-dweller </p><p>was Aztec. We can only guess at that, with the </p><p>probabilities pointing to another race entirely. </p><p>The Aztecs left records that proved authorship. </p><p>The cliff-dweller did not. Never heard of buried </p><p>Aztec relics there save in a novel of lurid and highly </p><p>imaginative type. </p><p> In the Spring of 1858 the canon was partly ex-</p><p>plored by Lieut. Ives of U. S. A. Eng. Corps. Went </p><p>up to lower end Black Canon in steamer Explorer, </p><p>then through Black Canon in rowboat to Las Vegas, </p><p>Wash. Left boat again 100 miles below, joined </p><p>ck-train, went up east bank to the plateau. Had </p><p>S. Newberry with him as geologist. </p><p> 1871 Lieut. Wheeler was sent out by chief of</p><p>Eng. Corps. Explored canon from below. In the </p><p>Fall started from Fort Mojave, went to the mouth </p><p>of Diamond Creek. Gilbert, geologist this trip. </p><p> Major J. W. Powell made many trips, in 1869,</p><p>1870, ’71, ’72, ’82, ’89, part up and part down the </p><p>canon. </p><p> Charles S. Russell of Prescott and E. R. Monett of</p><p>Goldfield, both practical miners, made a successful </p><p>trip. Julius F. Slone of Ohio, with Nathaniel </p><p>Galloway, S. S. Dubendorff and R. A. Cogswell went </p><p>from Green River Station, Wyoming to Needles in </p><p>boats, photographing and examining all the way. </p><p>Emery C. and Ellsworth L. Kolb, brothers, made </p><p>same trip to Tovar by boat. Dozens of prospectors </p><p>have prospected sections. </p><p> There are a few claims that give meager returns in</p><p>gold and many fake claims that wouldn’t board a </p><p>Lost Trails </p><p>burro, but are taken up to get a grip on some loca- </p><p>tion along the rim that may some day be worth </p><p>having. I never heard of copper or any other than </p><p>gold and gypsum there. </p><p> In the forests that cover plateaus at the south and</p><p>northeast there are deer, bear, mountain lions, bob- </p><p>cats, coyotes, wild turkeys, quail and other small </p><p>game. Trout are found in creeks. I do not know </p><p>the river fish of the Colorado. </p><p> El Tovar, the big hotel of the Santa Ffi system,</p><p>stands 7,000 feet elevation. Most of the country is </p><p>a series of great plateaus, not ridged and peaked as </p><p>are our Sierras, though there are some peaks and </p><p>191 </p><p>ridges at various distances. Look across the canon </p><p>and you have the impression of a level line, though </p><p>there are many dips in it. </p><p> The country is built up of layer deposits, capped</p><p>by lava from various volcanic eruptions. There </p><p>arc many cinder cones, mostly red. </p><p> One branch canon has extensive deposits of</p><p>beautiful marble. At other places, there are great </p><p>stretches of granite. A layer of blue limestone </p><p>exists 2,500 feet below the rim. Other rocks arc </p><p>basalt, black gneiss, slates, quartzites, sandstone, </p><p>and obsidian or volcanic glass. Thin seams or </p><p>layers of iron ore give color to much of the rock. </p><p>LOST </p><p>TRAILS </p><p> Note—We offer this department of the "Camp-Fire" free of charge to those of our read-</p><p>ers who wish to get in touch again with old friends or acquaintances from whom the years </p><p>have separated them.
