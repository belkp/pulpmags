            <seg type="columnLine">because of the pleasure it gave him to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The more elusive alterations at which I</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">one, in particular, was quite signal: Mars-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">definable apprehensiveness quite at vari-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ance with his former character. Even in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the midst of some trivial or commonplace</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">conversation, a look of manifest fear</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would suddenly pass over his face, he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would scrutinize the shadows of the room</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with an apprehensive stare, and would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stop half-way in a sentence, apparently</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">forgetting what he had started to say.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then, in a few moments, he would re-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cover himself and go on with the inter-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rupted speech. * He had developed some</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">odd mannerisms, too: one of them was,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that he could never enter or leave a room</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">without looking behind him, with the air</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of a man who fears that he is being fol-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lowed or that some imminent doom is</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dogging his every footstep. But all this,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of course, could have been explained as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nervousness attendant upon, or resulting</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from, the illness that I suspected. Mars-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">den himself would never discuss the mat-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ter; so, after a few discreet suggestions</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that might have led him to unbosom him-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">self, if he so wished, I had tacitly ignored</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the visible changes in his manner and per-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sonality. But I sensed a real and perhaps</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tragic mystery, and felt also that the black</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">figurine on Marsder's table was in some</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">way connected with it. He had told me</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">much concerning his trip to Africa, which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had been undertaken because of a life-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">long fascination which that continent had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">held for him; but I knew intuitively that</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">One morning, about six weeks after</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">following several days of absence during</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which I had been extremely busy. He was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">living alone, with one servant, in the large</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">house on Russian Hill, San Francisco,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which he had inherited together with a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">considerable fortune from his parents,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">who were long dead. He did not come to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">answer my knock, as was his wont; and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">if my hearing were not exceptionally keen,</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I do not think I should have heard the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">ing me to enter. Pushing open the door,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I went through the hall into the library,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">found him lying on a sofa, near the table</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on which stood the black statuette. It was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">obvious to me at a glance that he was very</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ill; his thinness and pallor had increased</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to a shocking degree in the few days since</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I had seen him last, and I was immedi-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ately impressed by the singular fact that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he had even shrunken more in stature than</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could be explained by the crouch of his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shoulders. Everything about him had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shriveled, had actually withered as if a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">flame were consuming him, and the form</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on the couch was that of a smaller man</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">than my friend. He had aged, also, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his hair had taken on a new hoariness, as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">if white ashes had fallen upon it. His</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">eyes were pitifully sunken, and they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">burned as embers burn in deep caverns. I</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">manifest that I had won the favor and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">At this, he made an humble obeisance</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">toward my lovely guide, who smiled, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">addressed a few sentences to him, which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he forthwith interpreted, saying that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mybaloe had proffered me an invitation</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to remain in Azombeii as her guest.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> I had intended to broach immediately</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">upon me as her words were being trans-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">told the interpreter to thank Mybaloe and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">an unforeseen magic were upon me: my</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and my normal processes of thought were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">benumbed as by the working of some in-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sidious opiate. I had been eager to reach</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Lake Tchad, and the idea of tarrying by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the way had never before occurred to me:</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">now, it seemed the most natural thing in</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Lake Tchad became a dimly receding</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">habits and religion of the people of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Azombeii. According to their traditions,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the worship of Wanaos among them was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">almost as old as the world itself, and had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been introduced ages and ages ago by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">some white strangers from the north, who</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">called themselves Aroumani. These stran-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gers had settled and married among the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">natives, and their blood had gradually</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">become disseminated throughout the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whole tribe, who had always remained</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">apart from the other pagans of Adamawa.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">All white people were called Aroumani</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by them, and were looked upon with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">peculiar respect, on account of these tra-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ditions. Wanaos, as the Foulahs had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">said, was a deity of love and fecundation,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the mother of all life, the mistress of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">so that the Azombeiians might have an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">exemplar for their idols. It had always</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been customary to associate a living</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">sible that the pale strangers of whom he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spoke had been a party of Roman ex-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">plorers, who had crossed the Sahara from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Carthage and penetrated the Sudan.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">This would account for the classic fea-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">vague familiarity of some of the words</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spoken by Mybaloe was now explicable,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">since I realized that these words had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">borne a partial resemblance to Latin</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">vocables. Much amazed by what I had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">learned and by all that I had succeeded</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in piecing together, I lost myself in odd</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">reveries, while Nygaza continued his</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The day wore on, and I did not see</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mybaloe, as I had fully expected,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nor did I receive word from her. I began</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to wonder a little. Nygaza said that her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">absence was attributable only to urgent</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> I went for a walk through the village,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">have comprised two or three thousand</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">people. All was neat and orderly, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the general degree of cleanliness was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">quite remarkable. The Azombeiians, I</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Toward the hour of sunset, a messen-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ger came, bearing an invitation from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mybaloe, which Nygaza translated. I was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to dine with her in her palace, and then</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">attend the evening rites in the local</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">temple.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> The palace stood on the very outskirts</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the town, among palms and pandanus,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and was merely an overgrown hut, as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">African palaces are wont to be. But the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">interior proved to be quite comfortable,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">even luxurious, and a certain barbaric</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">taste had been displayed in its furnishing.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">There were low couches along the walls,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">covered with draperies of native weaving,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">or the skins of the ayu, a sort of fresh-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">water seal found in the Benuwe. In the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">center was a long table, not more than a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">foot in height from the floor, around</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which the guests were squatted. In one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">corner, as in a niche, I noticed a small</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wooden image of a female figure, which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I rightly took to be a representation of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Wanaos. The figure bore a strange re-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">semblance to the Roman Venus; but I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">need not describe it further, since you</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">have often seen it on my library table.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Mybaloe greeted me with many com-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pliments, which were duly translated by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Nygaza; and I, not to be outdone, replied</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with speeches of a flowery fervor by no</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">means insincere. My hostess had me</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">seated at her right hand, and the feast</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">began. The guests, I learned, were most-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ly priests and priestesses of Wanaos. All</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of them regarded me with friendly smiles,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with the exception of one man, who wore</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a murderous frown. This man, Nygaza</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">told me in a whisper almost inaudible,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was the high-priest Mergawe, a mighty</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sorcerer or witch-doctor, much feared</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rather than revered, who had long been in</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> As unobtrusively as I could, I surveyed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mergawe with more attention. He was a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">muscular brute, over six feet in height,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and broad without being stout. His face</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was regular in outline, and would have</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been handsome, were it not for the distor-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tion due to a most malignant expression.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Whenever Mybaloe smiled upon me or</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">addressed some remark to me through</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Nygaza, his look became a demoniacal</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">glare. I readily perceived that the first day</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of my visit in Azombeii had brought me a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">powerful enemy, as well as a possible</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sweetheart.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> The table was laden with equatorial</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">delicacies, with the meat of young</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rhinoceros, several kinds of wild fowl,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bananas, papayas, and a sweet, highly in-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">toxicating palm-wine. Most of the guests</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were prone to gorge themselves in true</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">African fashion, but Mybaloe's manner of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">eating was as dainty as that of any Eu-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ropean girl, and she endeared herself to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">me all the more by her restraint. Mergawe</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">also ate little, but drank immoderately, in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a seeming attempt to achieve inebriation</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as soon as possible. The eating and drink-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing went on for hours, but I paid less and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">less attention to it and to my fellow-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">guests, in the ever-growing enchantment</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of Mybaloe's presence. Her sinuous youth-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ful grace of figure, her lovely tender eyes</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and lips, were far more potent than the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wine, and I soon forgot to notice even the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">baleful glaring of Mergawe. On her part,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mybaloe displayed toward me a frank</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">favor, swiftly conceived and avowed,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which she did not even dream of disguis-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing. She and I began to speak a language</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which did not require the interpretation</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of old Nygaza. With the one exception</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of Mergawe, no one seemed to regard</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">our mutual infatuation with anything but</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Presently the time of the evening rites</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">approached, and Mybaloe excused herself,</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">telling me that she would meet me later</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in the temple. The gathering broke up,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and Nygaza led me through the nocturnal</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">village, where groups of people were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">feasting and revelling about their fires in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the open air. We entered the jungle,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which was full of voices and flitting</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shadowy forms, all on their way to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fane of Wanaos. I had no idea what the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">temple would be like, though somehow I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">did not expea the usual African fetish-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">house. To my surprize, it proved to be an</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the rough edge of the pit in the cavern-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dome. I saw a stealthy movement in the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">through the silver-gleaming ebony of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">find no visible sign anywhere. I won-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dered if she were not hiding from me in</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> I was about to leave the ledge on which</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">a headlong suddenness into the black pool</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">seven or eight feet below. The waters</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were deep, and I sank almost to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bottom before I recovered myself or even</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">realized what had happened. Then I rose</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">down with accessible gradations, but the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">I heard a furtive rippling, and knew its</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I saw two of the great saurians, whose</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> I think that I must have cried aloud;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for, as if in answer, I heard a woman's</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">then the rippled waters were cleft by a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">falling form that shone for an instant</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with a flash as of black marble. A breath-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">less interval, while the waters foamed,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and then a well-known head arose beside</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">me, and an arm that held aloft a glitter-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">to its hilt in the side of the foremost</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">crocodile, as the monster opened his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">met the same unerring thrust of Myba-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">pool, and the dark bodies of others began</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to appear. With a superhuman agility,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in what was seemingly no more than a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">single movement, Mybaloe drew herself</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">out on the rocks of the margent, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">caught my hands in hers. An instant</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">knowing how I had come there, so light</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and swift had been my ascent. The croco-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> To my astonishment, Mybaloe denied</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">had passed without speaking, in as much</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> After our return to the village, My-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">flag. The red flag of danger! The duke</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">laughed, silently. He did not need a red</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Poor old James Garey--he had meant</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">There was no mistake. On his finger</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was the ring that James Garey had worn</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Garey? How much did this devil of a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">it was a left-handed gift. She could take</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">have known that almost before he and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Garey left America. Any one could see</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">With a deep sigh, the duke undressed</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">a thousand times on the steep roads, bor-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Finally they returned to the castle.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The lady, pleading indisposition,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">begged to be excused, but promised to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">dressed in an Oriental fantasy of laces</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the duke; rather it was a flower that she</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">For a while the duke thought that he</seg>
