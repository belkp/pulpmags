                            <title>THE DIAMOND LENS</title>, by <persName>Fitz-James O'Brien</persName>. This is one of the world's classics. A story
                            written years ago, but which retains its flavor to the fullest exten and brings in an exquisite microscope being, the
                            enchanting heroine of the story.</ab>

                            <title>THE PURCHASE OF THE NORTH POLE</title>, by <persName>Jules Verne</persName>. Here we give our readers the second
                            and concluding installment of this entrancing story. The author's ingenuity in evolving a cause for the remarkable fault
                            in mathematics is only revealed in the last lines.</ab>

                            <title>A COLUMBUS OF SPACE</title>, by <persName>Garrett P. Serviss</persName>. The story draws to an end. Attack,
                            adventure, captivity are all successfully coped with. And then comes a tragic termination and the reader does not know by
                            what possible means the denouement( can be brought about. As always with this author, the science of the story is
                            absolutely correct in all details.</ab>

                            <title>THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU</title>, by <persName>H. G. Wells</persName>. One of the most astounding stories ever
                            written by the well-known author. We have never read a story that held our interest at such a feverish pitch of excitement
                            as does this classic; we will not give away the contents to spoil it all for you. You may take our word for it that you
                            never read anything as weird and amazing as "The Island of Dr. Moreau."</ab>

                            a friendly visit. It is a powerful and gripping story which is sure to hold your interest. This story was crowded out of

                        and a prac- tical chemist with many well known achievements to his credit. Not only has Dr. Sloane taught chemistry for years
                        but he was for many years, engaged in commercial chemistry work.</ab>
                    <ab>Do you remember how the tales of pirate gold used to fire your imagination and make you want to sail the uncharted seas in
                        search of treasure and adventure? And then you would regret that such things were no longer done. But that is a mistake. They
                        are done--today and everyday--not on desert islands, but in the chemical laboratories throughout your own country. Quietly,
                        systematically, the chemist works. His work is difficult, but more adventurous than the blood- curdling deeds of the Spanish
                        Main. Instead of meeting an early and violent death on some forgotten shore, he gathers wealth and honor through his
                        invaluable contributions to hu- manity. Alfred Nobel, the Swedish chemist who invented dynamite, made so many millions that
                        the income alone from his bequests provides five $40,000 prizes every year for the advancement of science and peace. C. M.
                        Hall, the chemist who discovered how to manufacture aluminum made millions through this discovery. F. G. Cottrell, who devised
                        a valu- able process for recovering the waste from flue gases, James Gayley, who showed how to save enormous losses in steel
                        manufacture, L. H. Baekeland, who invented Bakelite--these are only a few of the men to whom fortunes have come through their
                        chemical achievements.</ab>

                    <ab>I have not written since I received the big set. I can still say that it far exceeded my anticipations. Since I have been
                        studying with your school I have been appointed chemist for the Scranton Coal Co. testing all the coal and ash by proximate
                        analysis. The lessons are helping me wonderfully, and the interesting way in which they are written makes me wait patiently

                    <ab>I wish to express my appreciation of your prompt reply to my letter and to the recom- mendation to the General Electric Co. I
                        in- tend to start the student engineering course at the works. This is somewhat along electrical lines, but the fact that I
                        had a recommenda- tion from a reliable school no doubt had con- siderable influence in helping me to secure the job.--H. VAN

                        yours is the fifth one I've studied.--JAMES C. FELIX.</ab>
                    <ab>From the the I was having Chemistry it has never been thus explained to me as it is now. I am recommending you highly to my

                        touching intimately every business and every product in the world. The work of the chemist can hardly be called work at all.

                        delightful experimentation, with the alluring prospect of a discovery that may spell Fortune always at hand to spur your
                        enthusiasm.</ab>
                    <ab>You Can Learn at Home</ab>
                    <ab>To qualify for this remarkable calling requires elaborate specialized training. Fomerly it was necessary to attend a
                        university for several years to acquire that training, but thanks to our highly perfected and thorough system of instruction,
                        you can now stay at home, keep your position, and let us educate you in Chemistry during your spare time. Even with only
                        common schooling you can take our course and equip yourself for immediate practical work in a chemical laboratory. Dr. Sloane
                        give every one of his students the same careful, personal supervision that made him celebrated throughout his long career as a
                        college professor. Your instruction from the very beginning is made interesting and practical, and we supply you with
                        apparatus and chemicals for performing the fascinating analyses and experimental work that plays such a large part in our
                        method of teaching, and you are awarded the Institute's official diploma after you have satisfactorily completed the
                        course.</ab>
                    <ab>Experimental Equipment Furnish to Every Student</ab>
                    <ab>We give to every student without additional charge this chemical equipment, including forty-nine pieces of labora- tory
                        apparatus and supplies, and forty different chemicals and reagents. These comprise the apparatus and chemicals used for the
                        experimental work of the course. The fitted heavy wooden box serves not only as a case for the outfit but also as a useful
                        laboratory accessory for performing countless experiments.</ab>
                    <ab>Easy Monthly Payments</ab>
                    <ab>You don't have to have even the small price of the course to start. You can pay for it in small monthly amounts - so small
                        that you won't feel them. The cost of our course is very low, and inlcudes everything, even the chemistry outfit - there are
                        no extras to buy with our course. Our plan of monthly payments places a chemical education within the reach of everyone. Write
                        us and let us explain our plan in full - give us the opportunity of showing you how you can qualify for a highly trained
                        technical position without even giving up your present employment.</ab>

                    <ab>Unfortunately the demand for men with electrical training has grown faster than the number of schools who can train them. The
                        big electrical firms depend upon School of Engineering of Milwaukee. Even the United States Government definitely requested
                        that S. of E. students make the acceptance test on the gigantic generating unit for the Panama Canal, shown in the picture
                        above. We need more men for these preferred jobs!</ab>
                    <ab>No wonder the U. S. Government calls for S. of E, men on the jobs that mean something. No wonder Commonwealth-Edison,

                        Engineering. If you were hiring men, wouldn't you naturally give the best jobs to those with the best training? To graduates
                        who had studied under men like Prof. Ball, formerly associated with Dr. Steinmetz, the electrical wizard. Wouldn't you prefer
                        men who had been out on important jobs like the Gov't Diesel engine test, described above, right while they were in
                        school?</ab>
