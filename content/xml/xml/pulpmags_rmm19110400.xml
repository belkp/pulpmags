I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought I would like to see how the law</seg><seg type="columnLine">would deal with his case, and, incident-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally, I wanted to be sure than an ex-caval-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ryman got a square deal, so I also went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the office of the justice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His honor was an ex-clerk from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quartermaster's department at the fort and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had accepted the office of justice against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the advice of his friends.

In time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his name became a nightmare to evil-doers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">When Cheyenne, Wyoming, was only a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">city of tents, Cheap John set up in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clothing business in a " ten-by-thirty "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">frame covered with canvas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Huge " Joke.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The story goes that he was such a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cringing, helpless little fellow that outlaws,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and even drunken loafers, would swagger</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into his place, cuff him around his own</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">store, help themselves to his goods and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">walk out without paying. This was enough</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to break the heart of any man. In those</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">days, every man carried the law in his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">own holster, and the weak went to their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">death without a murmur. Cheap John</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stood the cuffing and bullying, until, one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">day, three whisky-soaked cowboys entered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"and began their old game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  One of them, after rubbing the skin off</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the end of Cheap John's nose with the muz-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">zle of his six-shooter, laid the cocked weap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on on the counter, snaked the begging</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">little merchant by the hair to the back of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his store, then kicked him back again and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">under the counter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  While the three cowboys were roaring</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the huge joke, Cheap John popped up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on the other side of the counter, grabbed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the six-shooter of the nearest man, and in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">three seconds and three shots killed all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">three men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After that Cheap John was another man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He became a power in the wilderness.

Thus the need of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buffer was first recognized.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For more than thirty-two years after that</seg><seg type="columnLine">historic trip was made, passenger - cars</seg><seg type="columnLine">were coupled together with links and pins.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was somewhat better than the original</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mohawk and Hudson arrangement, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">still left a fearful amount of slack between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cars, so that a railroad journey was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">endless succession of bumps and jerks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Or course, the light equipment of early</seg><seg type="columnLine">days was not capable of exerting the tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous force of a modern steel train, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the difference was only in degree, and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">in kind. Just what railroad travel would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be without the buffer and the vestibule has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been eloquently set forth by the dyna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mometer.

Usually,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are under 35,000 pounds; but occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sionally they run as high as a hundred thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand pounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Buffing shocks, which are the reverse of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the jerks, vary from 5,000 to more than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">300.000	pounds.

The old link-</seg><seg type="columnLine">and-pin couplings kept the cars so far apart</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, in passing from orie to another, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveler had to make a leap-for life across</seg><seg type="columnLine">a yawning chasm. If he didn't drop be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the cars, he was likely to be wafted</seg><seg type="columnLine">out over the landscape if he ventured out</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the exposed platform when a high wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">was blowing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In case of collision, the frail platforms</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered no resistance, but crumpled like pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per. The heaviest loss of life on railroads</seg><seg type="columnLine">of early days was due to this cause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Miller's Platform.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This serious defect in passenger-cars was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the subject of a great deal of discussion;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but no one could suggest a remedy until</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ezra Miller secured his first patent on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform, buffer, and coupler in 1863.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miller was born in Bergen County, New</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jersey, in 1812. He was given a technical</seg><seg type="columnLine">education, and prepared for the profession</seg><seg type="columnLine">of civil engineer. He went to Wisconsin in</seg><seg type="columnLine">1848, where he lived the usual life of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pioneer until his attention was directed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the need of better cars. He undertook to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find some means to protect the lives of pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sengers in case of accident, and also to pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mote their comfort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The solution of the problem was the fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous Miller platform. Strength to resist</seg><seg type="columnLine">buffing shocks was given to the platform</seg><seg type="columnLine">and coupler by placing them in line with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car sills, instead of below them, as had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the practise. To take up the slack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so put an end to the bumps and jerks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miller added a buffer to his platform.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was simply a steel plate with an area</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a little more than a square foot on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">420</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">single stem in the center line of the car.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The buffer spring was of one-inch steel, five</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a half inches in diameter, backed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">by an eight-by-nine-inch timber fastened in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center platform sills. This relieved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw-bar spring of considerable stress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">First Automatic Coupler.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Miller platforms fitted together so</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely that one could step from one to an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other in entire safety. In fact, it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been impossible to fall between them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Such success could not have been accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plished with the old link-and-pin coupling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of necessity, the first automatic coupler was</seg><seg type="columnLine">introduced along with the Miller platform.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was die renowned Miller hook,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which every old-time railroad man will re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">call with a shudder. It cannot be denied</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Miller hook did splendid service</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its day, but--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On a straight track you could generally</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple two cars equipped with Miller hooks</seg><seg type="columnLine">without trouble. Miller hooks have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">known, also, to uncouple themselves while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the train was running without assistance or</seg><seg type="columnLine">solicitation; but when you wanted to cut off</seg><seg type="columnLine">a car at a station or in the yards, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">different.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having spotted your car, you seized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lever and "heaved on it." Next, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed your feet to better advantage, took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh grip on the lever, and heaved again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again, and yet again. Then you sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">naled the engineer to slack back, which lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">did after submitting some unkind remarks</seg><seg type="columnLine">about "cornfield sailors who tried to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroading."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Your partner came and helped heave on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lever, and, at length, the conductor</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang up to show how to cut off a car in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the highest style of the art, but only suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded in getting his hands soiled, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him grouchy for the rest of the trip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally, a car-repairer came along and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">those infernal hooks having wearied of each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other's' company, pulled the lever up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Coupling an engine or a car with an ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary draw-bar on to a Miller hook was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worst. You began by prospecting in a foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wet cinders 011 the back of the tank for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crooked link. You never found it until</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the cinders had been plowed over, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">required strong finger-nails.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As there was only a little niche in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of die hook for the reception of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">link, it was impossible to make a coupling</seg><seg type="columnLine">by guiding the link into place. Instead, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">link was placed in the hook and onto it the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary draw-bar was backed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no play for the link in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hook, and a man dared not' stand between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cars where he could guide it properly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for fear the hook would swing out and slip</seg><seg type="columnLine">bv, as it did nine times out of ten. Coup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling a Miller hook onto an ordinary draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar was like cracking an egg with a steam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammer. It could be done, but it required</seg><seg type="columnLine">a genius to do it and not lose his life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Miller platform, buffer, and coupler</seg><seg type="columnLine">were first tried on the Chicago and North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">western, and the Milwaukee and Prairie du</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chien in September, 1864. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hailed as the greatest life-saving inventions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the age.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miller lived to see his inventions adopt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed by every railroad in the United States,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in many foreign countries. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">earned a princely fortune, which he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to New Jersey to enjoy. He died</seg><seg type="columnLine">in 1885.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Miller platform was a long step in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right direction, but it did not go far</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough. Once given the cue, a host of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventors began groping after the vestibule.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first patent for a vestibule was grant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed to Charles Waterbury, June 29, 1852,</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve years before Miller brought out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform. It was a closed passage between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rounded ends of cars, with doors at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides. Its object was "to protect passen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers and exclude the dust."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was tried on the Naugatuck Railroad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Connecticut; but, being a flimsy affair</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wood and canvas, was discarded as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">failure at the end of two years. About the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time, similar affairs were tried in Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land and Russia with 110 better success.</seg><seg type="columnLine">None of these early vestibules made any</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt to perform the functions of a buffer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next attempt to provide a vestibule</seg><seg type="columnLine">was made by S. R. Calthorp, whose patent</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dated August 8, 1865, a year after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miller platform was brought out. Cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thorp's idea was to build a eigar-shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">train with pointed prow and rounded stern,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a ship. The vestibule was there, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Calthorp train looked like a caterpillar</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the dropsy. It never received serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frederick Upham Adams patented a ves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tibuled train on lines somewhat similar to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Calthorp's twenty years later, but the ves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tibule was merely an incident in his scheme</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BUFFER AND VESTIBULE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">421</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to reduce atmospheric resistance. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried out by the Baltimore and Ohio Rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">road, but was never adopted by any road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> C. S. Smith, among others, patented a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestibule in 1882. Smith's vestibule was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow passage, with a bellows-like hood</seg><seg type="columnLine">remotely resembling those in use to-day, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with doors in the corners of the cars. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not given a trial.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Sessions's Vestibule.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At length, H. H. Sessions hit upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right idea. He patented his "vestibule April</seg><seg type="columnLine">29, 1887. Then he showed it to George M.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pullman. The great palace-car builder</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought the patent outright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately the vestibule was made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pullman standard. As soon as possible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vestibuled train was built and started on</seg><seg type="columnLine">an exhibition tour of triumphal progress</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the principal cities. It created a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensation wherever it went. It was then</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed in service on the Pennsylvania.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">' The vestibuled train had not been run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning long when it figured in a collision--</seg><seg type="columnLine">running into another train at forty miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour. The engine was demolished, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passengers in the Pullmans were un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This spectacular demonstration of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">value of the vestibule as a life-saving device</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all that was needed to create a demand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Wagner Palace Car Company built</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestibuled cars without waiting for the for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mality of obtaining a license from Pullman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a great lawsuit, which resulted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a complete victory for the holder of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sessions patent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The vestibule, as Mr. Sessions first con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed it, was a narrow passage between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cars, with doors inside the line of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top step. A rubber bellows in a steel frame</seg><seg type="columnLine">with broad steel face-plates, kept in contact</seg><seg type="columnLine">by rods and springs, bridged the gap be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the wooden passage on the car plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A better buffer was needed than the Mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ler to make a continuous floor between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">platforms. So Mr. Sessions made the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">double-stem buffer the full width of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage, with broad bearing surface and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel apron to cover it and protect the feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of passengers. The face-plates of the ves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tibules performed the same service as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buffer by assisting to make a rigid connec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion between the cars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several unsuccessful attempts to im-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">prove the buffer were made. A. G. Leonard</seg><seg type="columnLine">invented a hydrostatic buffer, which con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sited of two cylinders placed between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center sills fitted with pistons and a ram</seg><seg type="columnLine">which held the buffer against a spring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a hand-pump in the car to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylinders filled with water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leonard's buffer was tried by the Wag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner Palace Car Company, but was quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">discarded. About the same time F. W.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Webb, an Englishman, got up a similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">contrivance with two cylinders nine inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">in diameter and a two-foot stroke, filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a mixture of petroleum, soap, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. It was tried on the London and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northwestern. A German inventor patent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed still another hydraulic buffer, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried in the fatherland. Both were failures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Solano's Face-Plate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> R. Solano patented a face-plate for vesti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bules, to be kept in contact by four pistons</seg><seg type="columnLine">working in air cylinders. F. A. Fox, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York, invented a face-plate held in</seg><seg type="columnLine">position by screw and bevel gear. J. N.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barr and others tried various inclined ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rangements by which gravity was used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold the plates in contact. All these schemes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were worthless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> H. C. Buhoup, however, really did im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove the face-plate in some particulars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Gould Coupler Company made a steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform which was very much stronger than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old wooden platform, together with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">two-stem, continuous-platform buffer, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a smooth floor in all positions, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">curves or elsewhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally, in 1895, the Standard Coupler</seg><seg type="columnLine">Company placed on the market the three-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stem buffer, in which the center stem was</seg><seg type="columnLine">free, while the end stems were attached to</seg><seg type="columnLine">an equalizer, which fully met the require-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of up-to-date railroad equipment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pullman, always quick to recognize a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, adopted it as the standard for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">palace cars, and by August, 1898, his lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been followed by forty-three railroad</seg><seg type="columnLine">companies..

With a feeling of disgust he threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">them aside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Sam opened another letter. This one was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a circular letter from the express company.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" One Thousand Dollars Reward " was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heading. It gave in detail the Bertillon</seg><seg type="columnLine">measurements and the description of a noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">international swindler, who had served sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral terms in jail and had many aliases.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He was about to throw it to one side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Agents generally give such things only pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing interest. But--he chanced to look on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opposite side of the circular.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He paled and his body seemed to become</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly paralyzed. Little chills began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">run up and down his back. His hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembled with excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Before him was a photographic likeness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crook wanted.

Then, also, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and fifty-four dollars were in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volved for which he would be held respon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible. The very thought of losing such an</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount made him shudder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was another risk to run. He might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be mistaken. Such coincidences had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened. He pulled out his watch. The pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of Mary on the inside of the case</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at Sam with a soft, tender gaze. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">white flame of passion shot through him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">charging his body with courage! He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrest this man!

He was so like an " old head " that Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">was uneasy. Now and then he \vould ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam a question that showed he was " dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">next to the job." This only made the situ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation more perplexing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twenty miles from Capeville was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town of Cooper--the division for the rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">road company.

It seemed to cling to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with the claws of a starving wolf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the first time in five years, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oxenham Fulward felt a cold and beady</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat on his brow. It is the sweat that</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes when fear enters the heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fulward didn't like it. It seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make him afraid of himself. He had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been that!--no, in all the years of his dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">honest}-, he had never lost his nerve or his</seg><seg type="columnLine">belief that lie could " make good " to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">institution when the time came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the thing was rising before him like</seg><seg type="columnLine">an insuperable barrier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fulward brushed the cold and beady</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat from his brow and began to think.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three things were quick in coming to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First: He had to stop stealing then and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. The matter had been going on long</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough. He would turn over a new leaf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Second: He would make good the amount</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Third: How?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The third was a stickler. It dissolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other two as the sun dissolves the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps the best plan was to make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good haul and take a flurry in the street.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could put his hands on some S25,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the trust company's money inside of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">week, for some unusually large collections</seg><seg type="columnLine">were coining in from the Western banks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He would watch the market closely, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew where he could get a tip or two that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be followed by a sudden rise--and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be well. Oh, it was easy!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, the whole thing might be blamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on another man! There was Bezon, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head collection-clerk, a silent, wan-faced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">plodding young man. His record was good,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been bonded by the surety company</seg><seg type="columnLine">because an influential friend had vouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him; he had to support a widowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother and all that--but sentiment could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no place when the getting of a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand dollars was the issue at stake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, he could not accuse Bezon</seg><seg type="columnLine">outright. Bezon was perfectly honest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">could prove it. Bezon would have to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found dead in the bank and, naturally, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">books would be examined and the shortage</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THOUSAND-MILE TICKET.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">439</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered. And Fulward would rise in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his might with horror-stricken countenance</seg><seg type="columnLine">and say, "How terrible!

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Fulward had an imaginative mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was yet another way out of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With peculiar force, it struck Fulward on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the solar-plexus of liis thinking apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he almost jumped with joy.

In a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">room of his Fifth Avenue mansion he gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the treasures of many lands, as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasures that marked various mile-posts in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his interesting career. Although these lat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter were of a personal nature, they were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nevertheless, as valuable to him as the real</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fake art objects of the old world for</seg><seg type="columnLine">which his money went so readily, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them, prided above all else, was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thousand-Mile Ticket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Because he was rich and powerful, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause his word was better than his bond,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he had done much for the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">town of his birth, the courts had set aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">all precedent and permitted him to take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">queerly made will into his own keeping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had promised that it would be more</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe in his private museum than in the safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the county court; that so long as life</seg><seg type="columnLine">was vouchsafed to him, he would guard it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with personal care.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The newspapers at the time made much</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the incident.

One day, despite bolts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bars, the famous book of transportation</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed up missing. Of course it was stolen</seg><seg type="columnLine">only for the reward. That was soon an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced. It was of goodly proportions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the book, without so much as a faded</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter, was returned to its rightful owner</seg><seg type="columnLine">and no questions were asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> J.

As before, it was returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">its gold case in the Low museum, and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up to the time of this narrative no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the courage to disturb it until Oxen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham Fulward, sitting in his private office</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Snowball Trust Company, racking</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brain for the quickest way to raise</seg><seg type="columnLine">$101,298 to cover his shortage, hit upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the theft of it as a particularly bright idea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So many months, aye, years, had elapsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">since its second disappearance that it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped the popular mind as a topic of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation.

No doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Low could be made to pay as much as</seg><seg type="columnLine">several hundred thousand dollars if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with the precious will in his possession</seg><seg type="columnLine">held out long enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the Iron Gate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">QXENHAM FULWARD sized up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own precaricus situation. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no cause for immediate danger.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was regarded as a first-class man. No one</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubted his integrity or business methods.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In short, he could let the matter stand for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">week or two--meantime he could take some</seg><seg type="columnLine">action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The more he thought of it, the more the</seg><seg type="columnLine">theft of the Thousand-Mile Ticket loomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up as-a possibility. He seemed to like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea the more he turned it over in his mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would work with the utmost caution,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay his plans with care and precision, get</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything arranged so there would be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitch--in fact, he would do it up brown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His first plan was to look over the Low</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THOUSAND-MILE TICKET.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">441</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mansion. This gabled and monolithed</seg><seg type="columnLine">domicile stood in the center of the mile of</seg><seg type="columnLine">millionaires' homes that bordered the east</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of Central Fark on the most aristo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cratic avenue in all the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is no time like the present,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">quoth Fulward to himself, and he tore up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheet of paper on which he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">figuring, recorded "$101,298 " in a corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the red-covered book, returned this</seg><seg type="columnLine">chronicle of his crime to its resting-place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started for the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shall I call you a cab, sir?" said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faithful Patrick, having devoured the politi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal sensations of the evening sheets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, thank you, Carr," replied the bank-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er.

Good</seg><seg type="columnLine">night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once outside, Fulward hurried up-town</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his club. While Patrick was musing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hard life of the overworked banker,</seg><seg type="columnLine">deprived of exercise by continuous appli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation to business, and seeking fresh air in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the highways, the object of his thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being whirled along in the Subway to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that part of the city where the theaters and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gay hotels cover the area that is commonly</seg><seg type="columnLine">known as the Tenderloin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He went to his club, ate a hurried dinner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">donned a long coat and a gray soft hat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made his way up Fifth Avenue. Tire</seg><seg type="columnLine">night was cool and inviting, and Fulward's</seg><seg type="columnLine">long perfecto never tasted quite so good.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He seemed-to have a certain spring to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">step that pleased him greatly. He was rath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er gay and light-hearted, rather jaunty and</seg><seg type="columnLine">debonair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a walk of some fifteen minutes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fulward reached the Low mansion. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in the shade of a tree that jutted over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Central Park fence. It finally dawned</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him that he had done a foolish thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for policemen, no doubt, were lurking in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows taking mental photographs of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">who leered suspiciously at the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It came to him again and again that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was foolish. What could he discover, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">could he help himself by simply staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that massive architectural monstrosity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel and stone?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could have secured a description of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place in any New York newspaper, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">columns were devoted to the minutest de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tails of its construction at the time of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">completion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked cautiously about him. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no officers in sight. Perhaps the guard</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of reserves had been ordered to a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant task. He turned. A bluecoat was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming down the avenue. Fulward started</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his direction with the casual air of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man out for an evening stroll. The officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed him by with silent tread. Fulward</seg><seg type="columnLine">surmised that he was the regular man on</seg><seg type="columnLine">patrol, walked on for a block or so, turned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed the street, and walked back until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was directly in front of the palace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " The museum is on the side facing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross street," he said as he strolled thither.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Placing his hands behind his back, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging his cane with a careless gesture,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stood there in a brown study.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Between the Low mansion and the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">that stood at its rear was a large yard--</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather large, indeed, even for the home of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York millionaire. The house was set</seg><seg type="columnLine">back from the street, and so was the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of the yard. This wall was of solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">brick and cement, and was built to a height</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ten feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the center of the wall was an entrance</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a heavy iron door--which opened only on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inside. Fulward was taking it all in</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a critical eye.

On the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, a lurking, suspicious man would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">more quickly " covered " than he who came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out boldly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes were making hast}' measure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of the various corners of the million-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aire's home, when, with a peculiar sudden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness that made his heart thump, the iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">door opened and a woman stepped out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fulward started to walk away as one</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconcerned, but something about the wom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">an arrested his attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the easy eye of the connoisseur, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been admiring the building.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instead, he was looking at the woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was quite sure that she was not one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the servants, for a servant would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have stood on the threshold of the gate so</seg><seg type="columnLine">gingerly and looked so appealingly up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">442</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">down the block. A servant would not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">started in the direction of Madison Avenue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and just because she saw a man approach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from that thoroughfare, turn and walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Fifth Avenue. But this particu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar maneuver pleased Mr. Fulward. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked to the corner of Fifth Avenue and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood on the curb and waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman came along and stood very</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to him, looking up and down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughfare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the darkness, and because of the rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy veil that covered her face, it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy to get a good view of her features.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fulward's keen eye, however, was not slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">in gathering that she was rather young and</seg><seg type="columnLine">frail and dressed in good taste.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her hat was small and jaunty, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut of her clothing showed that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied the modes. Around her neck was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a muffler of silver fox from the ends of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which dangled two tails of unusual size,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her hands were incased in a muff of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same expensive fur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fulward did not want to seem impolite or</seg><seg type="columnLine">impertinent. He did not want to exhibit</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ungentlemanly curiosity or the leering</seg><seg type="columnLine">look of a policeman. He wanted to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">why that young woman had so completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrested his attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Just then one of the big green buses that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply the avenue came along, and the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman stepped forward, held up a dainty</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and got aboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was only natural that Fulward should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be waiting for the very same bus. There-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, he boarded, too. The vehicle was</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat crowded, and the young woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so seated that when Fulward wedged</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself into a comfortable attitude, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly in front of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She took a tiny purse from her muff,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but she was some time in locating it in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">capacious hand-warmer. For a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fulward felt that he might have to offer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay her fare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fulward deliberately took her in from</seg><seg type="columnLine">head to toe. She was rather pretty. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">rould see through the veil, in the brightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">illumined bus, that she was more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinarily good-looking, with wavy blond</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair and a fair complexion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fulward began to wonder if she were</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of his persistent gazing. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly looked at him, but had kept her</seg><seg type="columnLine">poise so calmly under his apparent scrutiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he believed she was not disturbed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he thought himself a fool for having</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed her at all. Why had he gone to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this extreme? Why had he let this girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrest his mind to such an extent--he who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had cared so little for women as to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained a bachelor for forty-two years?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the other hand, there was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">so peculiar about the manner in which she</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out of the gate of the Low mansion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">something so queer, so unnatural in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner as she looked up and down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street, that he was sure that she had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret hidden, perhaps, in the silver fox</seg><seg type="columnLine">muff which she held so gracefully. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bus rumbled into Fifty - Seventh</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street. Near the corner of Broadway the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl beckoned to the conductor to stop. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">another breath she had gracefully stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the vehicle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fulward was so wedged in that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to turn to see the direction in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">she started when she left the car. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not care to attract attention by following</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. So he rode on for three or four blocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then alighted. Turning toward Broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, he walked in the direction of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughfare. When he reached it--gay</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the white lights that have given it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">world-wide fame--he looked in either di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection. not knowing which way to turn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I will stroll toward Forty-Second</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street," he said. "Maybe she will pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.

Home, to Fulward, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an apartment of three rooms in a building,</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely devoted to bachelors, that stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">midway between Fifth Avenue and Broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way in the forties--a building filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an array of apartments ranging from three</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms to seven, always crowded, and always</seg><seg type="columnLine">popular, and the tenants were all men whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">names stood for something in the various</seg><seg type="columnLine">callings of the great city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fulward occupied one of the smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THOUSAND-MILE TICKET.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">443</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'apartments. It was elaborately and most</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortably furnished. It contained all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little things that a bachelor likes--a read-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-table and a drop-lamp, a humidor for</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigars, a great bowl of line tobacco and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen pipes, and a walnut sideboard in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Fulward kept a small but select stock</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rare wines and several bottler of whisky</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and in order to establish a side of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's character not hitherto told, he was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">teetotaler in every sense of that hybrid word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The liquids were kept only for his friends,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they were legion. Fulward made friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made them quickly. Having made</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, he held them. He spent money on</seg><seg type="columnLine">them with a lavish hand, and he loaned it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them to. such an extent that he was called</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good thing. His dinners were a delight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his motor-trips to Long Island and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other spots dear to the New Yorker were</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequently attended by large parties--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fulward paid most of the bills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fulward drew his comfortable chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">alongside his reading-table and lit his fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vorite pipe. Peering through the clouds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke, he reviewed his own criminal career,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked with a pitying face at the portrait of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dear mother, whom he thanked God was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead and could never know the disgrace</seg><seg type="columnLine">that might come to him, and then -- he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he arose and paced the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm a fool! I'm a fool!" he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloud. " Why, that woman was nothing--</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing! I'll forget her. There!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did forget her. He drove her from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind, and all the next day and the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gave up his spare moments to the devel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">opment of the scheme that would lead to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the theft of the Thousand-Mile Ticket. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be the paramount issue in his career</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it was consummated or proved to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">worthless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed to him that, with his intimate</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendship among prominent men, it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be impossible for him to get some sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an introduction to the Low home. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">known in financial circles that the mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lionaire was not of the social few selected</seg><seg type="columnLine">by family, age, and wealth to represent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elite of the metropolis. Although he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">added the " Erasmus " to his name, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced the John to a simple " J.," this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the purpose of having a signature that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be unusual and not easy to imitate</seg><seg type="columnLine">should some evil-minded person try to use it</seg><seg type="columnLine">fraudulently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Aside from the exact value of the securi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ties and first mortgages that came into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping, and the whirling flourish with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he signed his famous name, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">art collection, he had no other whims what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soever. He was a plain, ordinary man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">fond of all the good things of life, but when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it came to putting on dadoes in order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear at Mrs. Tufthunter's tea or Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parvenu's evening, he was out of the run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning. The only man or woman who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">better than J. Erasmus, in his calculating</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, was the one who could make more</seg><seg type="columnLine">money than he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, with this kind of a man to deal with,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it did not seem difficult to Fulward to get an</seg><seg type="columnLine">introductory letter on the pretense of ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amining some of the art treasures in the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's collections.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, there was Jimmy Stanwood. Jim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">my was a sort of majordomo to the Lows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when the head of the family preferred</seg><seg type="columnLine">the comfort of his bed to a night at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opera, Jimmy acted as escort and got a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good dinner, a ride in the Low motor;</seg><seg type="columnLine">bus, and heard some good music--and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he was a comely good-for-nothing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a pleasant manner and a good tailor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, Jimmy would be just the very man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The very man, indeed. Fulward would ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to dinner at the club, and then, in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy-going way, would turn the subject to</seg><seg type="columnLine">art and art collectors, and J. Erasmus Low</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be the main topic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Fulward would say how he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">give his life to see the wonderful things</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were stored in the Low museum, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't Jimmy--wouldn't he please give</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a letter to Mr. Low, or get permission</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bring him to the house, or--anything, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">long a; lie could spend an hour or so in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful place drinking in the stories that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the collection would tell, and incidentally</seg><seg type="columnLine">slip the Thousand-Mile Ticket into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, Jimmy might hedge. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">might feel that he would be overstepping</seg><seg type="columnLine">his privileges in the Low household, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that--but Fulward had always been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">convenient man whenever a loan was needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and Heaven knew that Jimmy Stanwood</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed one often enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, that was the plan--the best, most</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fulward had come to that conclusion one</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon just before the close of the bank-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing day. Before he left the office he took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheet of his private note-paper and wrote a</seg><seg type="columnLine">most polite note to Jimmy asking him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">444</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">meet him at the dub for dinner on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">following night at seven, and if he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not make it on the night stated, to come at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earliest opportunity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He placed the letter in his pocket. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would mail it when he left the office. Lean-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing back in his chair, he lit a cigar and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">smiled at the prospect. He was more than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pleased with himself. He was a real genius,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a regular Napoleon, when it came to de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">veloping diplomatic moves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then, like a mighty wave of desire, like a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">powerful fever that robs one of his strength,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like the magnetism of one who vibrates in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unison with our ideas, Fulward felt the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">inclination to steal come over him. Oh,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there could be no harm in dipping into the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pot once more! He had taken so much, so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">very much, that another thousand or two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would not make the slightest difference</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whatsoever!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  If he were to be caught, it would be just</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as well to be hung for a sheep as a lamb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These and similar thoughts passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his mind, and they were emboldened</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the prospect of stealing the Thousand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mile Ticket, the absolutely certain prospect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very great reward that would be offered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the return of the precious document, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 covering up of his peculations, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">honest, upright life that he would lead ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">after. No, another thousand or two would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make no difference -- no difference what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Fulward arose, pushed his hat on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of his head, swung open the door of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his private office, and with the brisk air</seg><seg type="columnLine">and studied demeanor of a man on whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">head is resting the troubles of the world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked into the collection department.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Patrick Carr did not pay the slightest bit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of attention to him. Mr. Fulward was too</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">familiar a figure around the offices, work-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing after banking hours, and Patrick was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">too accustomed to his energy to give him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">even a look.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Mr. Fulward entered the collection de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partment. He remained within its brass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">latticed walls for a period of ten or twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes. Then he returned to his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">office, closed his desk, put on his overcoat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and passed into the street. At the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">mail-box he posted the letter to Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stanwood. Then he took four five-hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred-dollar bills from his trousers pocket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled them up tightly, and transferred them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his pocketbook.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He went up-town, and, after dinner, to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his favorite pastime--roulette. He played</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his usual luck. He ran the two thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand up to five thousand, and then, in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort to double, dropped back. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to quit, there remained about five</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred of the original two thousand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he reached home that night it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusually late. He had played longer tharf</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual, and it was nearly one in the morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he turned the key in the front door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and aroused the sleepy colored boy who</seg><seg type="columnLine">operated the elevator to a sufficient' state of</seg><seg type="columnLine">animation to be taken up to his floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hallway was illumined by subdued</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric lights, and the heavy carpet on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor--purposely used so that those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">came home late would not disturb those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were already asleep -- seemed softer</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ever to his footsteps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He inserted the key in the lock, opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door, and stepped inside. All this he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did with a peculiar sense of the unwritten</seg><seg type="columnLine">rules of the apartment--rules made by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bachelor tenants themselves--that one com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in during the small hours would move</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much like a ghost as possible. So Ox-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enham Fulward opened his door with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">caution of a nurse in a hospital ward, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with equal caution closed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had thrown his coat half off, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unmistakable metallic tapping in the liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-room turned him as livid as a stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He listened. The tapping stopped, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then it started again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There could be no mistaking the sound--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but what in the name of all that was good</seg><seg type="columnLine">could any burglar find in his rooms? He</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled at the thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pulled his coat over bis shoulders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stepped as softly as a cat from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little hall into the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew just where the button was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would throw the room into a flood of light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was right at his elbow. He had only</seg><seg type="columnLine">to touch it, and the midnight marauder</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be cowering before him in all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">iniquity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He watched the tiny round light of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">burglar's lantern as it flashed up and down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door of the walnut locker in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he kept his liquors.

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">man handled the same engine for a very long</seg><seg type="columnLine">period; he contributed toward few, if any, engine</seg><seg type="columnLine">failures, and he kept the machine out of the shop</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a phenomenal period, as such things are</seg><seg type="columnLine">measured, before heavy repairs became necessary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The interest which he feels in his locomotive is</seg><seg type="columnLine">largely proprietary.

He was born in New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York State in 1841, where he spent his first</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter of a century, and where he became the -</seg><seg type="columnLine">husband of Miss Clara Main. Like many other</seg><seg type="columnLine">energetic young men, the West looked attarctive</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him, so in 1865 he and his wife set their faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the prairies of Iowa. They stopped at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boone, which was the terminus of the Chicago</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Northwestern at that time, and started a</seg><seg type="columnLine">boarding camp for the men who were building</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first bridge across the Des Moines River.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was at this bridge in later years that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most thrilling incident in his life occurred, says</seg><seg type="columnLine">The North Western.

She ran to the bridge after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighting an old miner's lantern held in a railroad</seg><seg type="columnLine">frame, and saw that the bridge was gone. . She</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted and swung her lantern over the rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. A faint answer came from the engineer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was the only survivor of the crew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineer told her to go to Moingona sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, a mile away, and warn the fast express</seg><seg type="columnLine">train, then nearly due.

He wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to revel in his new-found wealth. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to paw it over until his hands were</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired of the worn crispiness of the notes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then he would put them to one side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a cat tired of her kittens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went to the door and looked out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landscape. He scanned the horizon, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran his eye over the tree tops, he looked into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley below, and he even looked into</seg><seg type="columnLine">several of the empty houses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was not a soul in sight.

He piled it up in various</seg><seg type="columnLine">piles according to its denomination.

He also unearthed a stew-pan that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was bent and battered and which the ero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions of time was quickly turning to rust:</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large spoon, also turning to rust ; several</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller pans of equal decay; three empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">tins; a knife that was in a fair state of</seg><seg type="columnLine">preservation, for it had been wrapped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">several pieces of cloth and stuck in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In another house he found a table. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried this and the stove and various kitch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">en utensils into the cabin just next door to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his. He had plenty of room, and why not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the kitchen removed from the house?</seg><seg type="columnLine">The smell of cooking was none too pleasant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at any rate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stove had only one leu. Instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching for the other three, Baker knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the remaining one and let it rest on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom on the floor. Having accomplished</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, he realized the importance of having</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ax and one or two other tools to put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stove-pipe in place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Baker started out in quest of these things.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not find an ax, but he found a mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erable apology for a chisel, a dozen screws,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wooden mallet, and a coil of wire. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">added all of them to his stock. Noticing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a piece of stove-pipe jutting from the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cabin not far from his own, he wended</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way thither and wrenched it loose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had to be pretty careful, for the metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the last stages of decay. Stove-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piping seemed pretty scarce, but with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">length he could at least get his stove in</seg><seg type="columnLine">working order.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He moved the stove against the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">and deftly arranged the pipe so that it point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed outward. In order to accomplish this</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had to turn the stove slightly on one end.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One or two blocks under the stove held it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, and the wire served well to keep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe -from leaning out so far that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">liable to lose its balance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next thing to do was to get stove-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lids, and yet that could wait until he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pots and pans in order. Taking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">largest pot to a point of vantage back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kitchen, Baker beat it with the mallet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scraped it with the chisel until the rust</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to disappear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">474</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The metal was pretty far gone, however.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was like trying to save wood that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been burned in a lire. He scraped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounded the tin vessel until it showed some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its pristine glory; then he placed it on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stove, filled it with water from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring, and proceeded to light a fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Baker was too old a desperado not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know the simple method of producing fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">by friction. With his knife, a piece of flint</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he always carried, and some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry sticks which littered the place, he soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a good fire in the old stove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon the water was boiling and eating</seg><seg type="columnLine">away the rust. Baker supplied more water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as it came to the boiling-point he scraped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sides of the pan with a stick, applying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power that lay back of his muscles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a short time the pot was in a present-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able shape. Though battered and worn, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clean and would do for cooking. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed it in the sun for a few minutes while</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gathered more wood, and it was not long</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the pot was again on the stove serving</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a bath-tub for the smaller utensils, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were boiled and scraped until Baker had</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite a respectable dining-layout.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stove needed four lids, but two would</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffice for the present. Baker went on an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other foraging trip. This time he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lid that was much too large for the stove</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his kitchen, but which would answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">every purpose. A few feet further he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tin cover of a miner's dinner-bucket.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This would also serve as a stove-lid, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aid of a stone to keep it in place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He filled his large pot with clean water</seg><seg type="columnLine">and put it on to boil. The sun was begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning to dip low toward the west, and the .</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool breeze that ushers in evening was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up from the lowlands. It was nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">time for his dinner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went into the vegetable garden and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled up three large well-formed potatoes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a beet, and two parsnips. These would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient. Perhaps it would be best to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparingly with the viands--they would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to last him for months.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He washed them and scraped them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">put them on to boil. He stood ovaf them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the air of a chef as the water bubbled'</seg><seg type="columnLine">and foamed. Now and then he prodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vegetables with his knife. They taxed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his patience a bit when they did not soften</seg><seg type="columnLine">as quickly as he anticipated, and he won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered if all things took so long to prepare</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally the meal was before him. On a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tin platter on the rough table, with the an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient spoon to aid, he sat him down, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his life nothing ever tasted quite so good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he ate, he lacked but one thing, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought--that ever necessary staple, salt. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is wonderful what the palate demands. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a while, Baker thought that if he had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwell in that place without salt, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">go mad, but then he remembered the stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had heard of the men who crossed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rockies, with Fremont, who put gunpowder</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their food in lieu of salt and found it</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty good at that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He also remembered having read another</seg><seg type="columnLine">article by a famous Chinese diplomat, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">held that eating salt was only a habit, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very bad habit at that. The air we</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathe, the food itself, the water in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is cooked, all contain a sufficient amount</seg><seg type="columnLine">of salt to satisfy the wants of any man, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the promiscuous application of it to one's</seg><seg type="columnLine">food is dangerous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     CHAPTER IV.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     His House in Order.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TPHE meal finished, Baker cleaned up</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pots and pans, brushed off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, and began the task of putting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">house in order. That it needed yellow soap,</seg><seg type="columnLine">water and elbow grease, was more than evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Baker could easily supply the water and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the elbow grease, and in place of soap, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">used the fine sand that lie scraped up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dilapidated " streets,'' and a piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft sand-stone. Filling his largest pail</seg><seg type="columnLine">with water, this modern Crusoe got down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">all fours, rolled up his sleeves, and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">at it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Baker mansion was quickly trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed into a spick and span frontier cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Early the next morning, like the Crusoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">of renown, Baker strolled about to get better</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquainted with his circumjacence. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed to a high knoll which commanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good view of the deserted camp and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounding country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Baker took it all in keenly. From his in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">timate knowledge of that part of the world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he realized that he was at the outer edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Bad Lands, and that it would be safer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remain where he was than move in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the east and north of him lay die im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">passable and inhospitable Bad Lands; to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the west and south the open country.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BAKER OF THE BAD LANDS.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">475</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could see the flaming posters now be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing nailed to every available tree and fence-</seg><seg type="columnLine">post and country store, offering, perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">five thousand dollars for the return of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body--dead or alive. He could see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted sheriffs and their daring men dash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hither and yon on foam-flecked steeds</seg><seg type="columnLine">at every little breath of a rumor, think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a hanged sight more of the reward than</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him.

That's the way they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">look at it--so Baker surmised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stretched himself at length on a rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">and watched the sun glint to silver the spires</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lime-stone peaks crowning the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">region to his right. He pulled his hat down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shadow his eyes, gave the bag containing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fortune a hitch so that it would not jab</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his side--and the whole world was his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A lizard darted from its home in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks-close by, scrambled up to the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a boulder some six feet away, and began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">blink in the delight of its morning sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Baker watched it closely and began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme.

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the coaches though there was a lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle party of a different sort; a Welsh family</seg><seg type="columnLine">of father, mother, and grown-up daughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">going up to Scranton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl was quite pretty and not badly</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed; a fact which Bill had noticed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first sight, as he was a bachelor then. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to keep pretty close to that car</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the time after that. It happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was a particularly ugly bunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of foreigners in there, and Bill was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clined to fear that there would be trouble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It came, unfortunately, when Bill was</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere else. Some of the other occu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pants of the car had noticed the girl, also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and although the little party of Welsh</seg><seg type="columnLine">folks kept strictly to themselves, the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">began staring at her and saying things</seg><seg type="columnLine">among themselves. By and by, one fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low who had had a few drinks too many</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped over and started to sit down by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her father jumped up and struck him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then three or four more of the gang</seg><seg type="columnLine">piled on top of the old man and tried to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">punch holes in him with their boot-heels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the girl and her mother yelled for</seg><seg type="columnLine">help.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill heard the yells in the next car. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than a minute he was in the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mix-up with both fists flying and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a 190-pound Pennsylvania Dutch</seg><seg type="columnLine">brakeman to help him out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In less than two minutes Bill and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brakey were in undisputed possession of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor, except such portions of it as were</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied by prostrate members of the gang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Naturally the Welsh folks made a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuss over Bill.

Bill took another look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl and told them that he often laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">over in Scranton.

A contro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versy arose between Mr. Rastrick and me</seg><seg type="columnLine">affecting the rate of traveling with those</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines. He admitted that in the case of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an engine standing still and kept from mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing by the weight sufficient to prevent it</seg><seg type="columnLine">from moving forward, and operating over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a single fixed pulley, though the wheels of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engine should, by an increase of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of the steam, turn round more rap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">idly, it would produce no increase of moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">force, and the engine would continue to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " But he says, and says truly, that when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engine is in motion, if there be a moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">force sufficient to overcome the resistance</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind it, if there be no slipping of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels, the engine will then move forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">more rapidly in direct proportion to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidity with which the wheels turn round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I agree to that, if the fact be so. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it may happen that the machine is not per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly steady upon its wheels. These may</seg><seg type="columnLine">slip back; the weight may perhaps overcome</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moving force in question, produced by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the friction; thtf slipping back may increase</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the weight to be drawn increases, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">die question is, will there not be slipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">which has a tendency to counteract the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of the machine to go forward?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">How to Prove That She Slips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Rastrick admits to me that if on</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inclined plane you get to a certain ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vation, the machine may turn its wheels</seg><seg type="columnLine">round, but will not go forward or back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward ; because, in that instance, the resolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the force of gravity on that plane is</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly sufficient to counterbalance the fric-</seg><seg type="columnLine">496</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tion by which the machine is intended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be propelled, and the one counterbalancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other, the whole will remain stationary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, if we have an engine moving at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain rate, not indeed upon a level plane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but upon another and less inclined plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the one on which it will stop, I say it</seg><seg type="columnLine">must of a certainty slip back. In the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">case put, it must slip back altogether. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inclined plane--when it arrives at such</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inclination as to stop the machine alto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether--it is palpable that the progressive</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion is equal to the slipping back. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a progressive motion arising from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning of the wheels, and- a slipping back</seg><seg type="columnLine">arising from the inclined plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " In this extreme case it slips back al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">together. Now, in the other case, I say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slipping back will be in proportion</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater or less according to the weight to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged up and the inclination of the plane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If my position be true--and I am not con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious of any fallacy in it--is there no mode</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ascertaining it?

Every person knows that the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portion of the diameter to the circumference</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a circle is about 3.1416. The wheels</seg><seg type="columnLine">were four feet in diameter. If so, 536</seg><seg type="columnLine">strokes of the piston (which would pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duce 536 turnings of these wheels) would</seg><seg type="columnLine">give 6,735j^ feet. According to that, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine would have gone the distance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">6,735j/2 feet; but inasmuch as the distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a mile and a quarter, the actual pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gressive motion was only 6,600 feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " It follows that diere was a slipping back</seg><seg type="columnLine">in ascending 135^4 feet.

Now, observe</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it did during the second experiment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with only eight wagons behind it. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">would produce a less retardation; and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">young gentleman has shown that when there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were only eight wagons behind it the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance was accomplished in 520 strokes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the piston, and, consequently, there" was then</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a slipping back of 35*k.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Would Have Her Slide Both Ways.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, to what is it that the committee</seg><seg type="columnLine">can attribute the additional slipping except</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the greater weight behind the engine?</seg><seg type="columnLine">This is the state of facts in ascending; in</seg><seg type="columnLine">descending, it is different. When die weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">is behind, then the whole weight slides</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward together. It is palpable, then, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weight behind neither accelerates nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">retards the engine; the consequence is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engine runs, as it were, alone down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane, but it has the whole weight attached</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it and acting upon it when it goes up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Does not this again confirm, and is con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmed by what this young gentleman has</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated, viz., that in descending, in bodi ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periments, the strokes of the piston are</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where the same circumstances occur,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are equal; but where there is a weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragging behind, there is a slipping propor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionate to that weight; and I put this fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">against all their theory.

Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty years ago rich iron ore was discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the tops of these hills, and a line was</seg><seg type="columnLine">constructed from their base to the little port</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Watchet, for the purpose of conveying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ore to small schooners, and thence to Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diff, Wales, there to be smelted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the foot to the top of the hills an</seg><seg type="columnLine">incline about a mile--in length was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed that, in point of length and steep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, was a rival to the Lickey incline. Flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">cars were drawn up the slope by a steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope, and it was considered a fairly plucky</seg><seg type="columnLine">feat to squat in the bottom of one of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">cars and be speeded to the top.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day it was discovered that the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of ore could be bought much cheaper</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Spain, so the mines and the line were</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandoned. So, too, was the village of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brendon, near the mines, and one or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hamlets at the foot of the hill?.

The maiden</seg><seg type="columnLine">aunt died, and in her place he installed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife, she being the daughter of the village</seg><seg type="columnLine">carpenter. Goodly was she to look upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and good tempered withal, for Jonas had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a profound conviction that nearly all mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried unhappiness arose from acid dispo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitions on the part of one or both of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">contracting parties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stony farm had been sold at a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">round profit to a company who wanted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">portion of it for factory purposes. Jonas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">acting on a hint given him by a Boston</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend, made several other investments which</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned out well. He was being looked upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his neighbors as an unusually fortunate</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day the good, childless wife died.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jonas remained, but not many of the things</seg><seg type="columnLine">or people of his schoolboy days were left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">546</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Factories were springing up in and about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the viljage, and strange faces were many.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His trade had dwindled to a mere noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing--a fact that gave him but little con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cern financially. The Guernsey Bank had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed into the hands of strangers--a hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pening that worried him greatly. Many of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his friends had gone elsewhere--for a rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">road is destructive to the instinct of lo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tode Allen had long ago emigrated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the West. Jonas felt a stranger in his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">land. He was fifty-nine years old, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">good health, comfortable circumstances, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet poor in the things that make life worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">living.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fate had given to him and taken from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him unsparingly, and now he was harbor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a growing conviction that congenial hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man companionship would be infinitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">preferable to his present state of loneliness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he wrote to Allen, with whom he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept up a desultory correspondence for</seg><seg type="columnLine">years. Allen had had his fill of fun and</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger in the West, and, at length, had lo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated in a permanently prosperous mining</seg><seg type="columnLine">region in Colorado--a region of frame</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses, a brick church, and holes in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountainsides that cost millions to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">and maintain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had struck the place at the inception</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its prosperity, opened a general store,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave credit liberally, and won confidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and respect by his fair dealing and fearless-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. In the course of his upward progress</seg><seg type="columnLine">he started a bank. He was its manager,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cashier, teller, and janitor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bank flourished amazingly.. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides the local business, which was not in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable, it had a savings department</seg><seg type="columnLine">that grew with the months, and the amount</seg><seg type="columnLine">of money that it sent each week to Europe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Eastern States, to relatives of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">miners, ran into thousands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tode Allen, partly through his expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riences with Western conditions and partly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his early absorption of New Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land conservatism, made investments that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have met with the approval of even</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jonas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Incidentally, Allen had married. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, who was now bordering on early man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood, was one of the bank-tellers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Allen had never forgotten that his cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent good fortune was more or less directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">due to Jonas. The financial end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">obligation had been discharged years be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, but Tode wanted to do more for hi?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">old friend. Among other things, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">on several occasions written him, begging</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to visit the Dunstan's Level region, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mining center was called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally Jonas made up his mind to go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the day -that he arrived Tode and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">son were at the depot to greet him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've come out here to stay," said Jonas</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night after a jolly dinner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bully!

" Fact is, y'</seg><seg type="columnLine">see," went on Jonas, " I'm getting old and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit fidgety, and have my fads and fan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cies on me sometimes, and I'm not going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to upset this household with any such fool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishness. So, with your help, Mrs. Allen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm going to find a place of my own near</seg><seg type="columnLine">by, where I can growl and go to sleep with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my boots on and behave scandalous with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dinner, and nobody to say peppermint</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Persuasion was useless, and the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the week saw him comfortably installed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a four-room cottage, about a hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Allen house. The ancient but act-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ive widow of a miner acted as housekeeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him. He saw as much of the Allens as</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever. Theodore Jr. and Jonas became the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater friends with the passing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day Jonas dropped in at the bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Tode," said he, " I want to have a chat</seg><seg type="columnLine">with vou."

The interview was brief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jonas had a conviction that it would be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good thing for him to realize on his Eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">investments and open a deposit account with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proceeds in the First Bank of Dun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stan's Level. This conviction was followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the action, and, two months later, Jonas</seg><seg type="columnLine">Okeman was credited on the books of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank with $18,725.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"And mind you, Tode," said he, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">received his bank-book.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">associatipn, in a fashion, took the place of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unions among the unorganized men by</seg><seg type="columnLine">guaranteeing weekly sums in case of death,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickness, and in some instances destitution,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each payment being in kind and proportion</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the amount of the member's fee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was a small but sound institution that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was well patronized by the miners. Eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were behind it, and it had the approval</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the majority of jnine-owners. Its funds</seg><seg type="columnLine">were almost entirely invested in safe prop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erties owned by its backers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Erasmus Whopple, the manager of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">association, prior to becoming connected</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it, had been successful in insurance</seg><seg type="columnLine">circles, which means that he ate, drank',</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept, and talked insurance affairs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">things appertaining thereto from morn till</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. Such is the essential and the pen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alty of achievement in that profession which</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks upon mankind only from the view-</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of a " risk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For the rest, Mr. Whopple was large,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy-voiced, and somewhat self-important.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wore a massiye gold watch-chain, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his white vest was in evidence at all sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons of the year.

Being a friend of the Allens, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">association's manager was not infrequently</seg><seg type="columnLine">at their home, where, to Jonas's intense dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gust, he would pour forth a flood of insu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rance talk from the time of his entrance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hour of his exit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Occasionally, Jonas would cause a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment's check of the turgid torrent by sar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">castic comment or dry retort, after which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Erasmus would boom and thunder along</seg><seg type="columnLine">with added volume.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Queries on die part of Jonas as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether Mr. Whopple had ever insured a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man against being talked to death by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent, or whether any policy issued by him</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained a restrictive clause against kill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a "jibbering jackass," will sufficiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicate his feeling regarding the manager.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In course of time Jonas passed from pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive distaste to active dislike of Mr. Whop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple, and Mr. Whopple regarded Jonas with</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotions much die reverse to friendly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the following spring ripples of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble began to fleck the usually placid</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of life at Dunstan's Level. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a strike among the miners--a bitter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrating, hot-blooded strike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The inevitable followed. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush of outside men who were only too</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad to get a foothold.

Dunstan's Level was in per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petual turmoil.

In a few minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was trudging by the side of his guide.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wide Slide was a natural sort of terrace on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side of the mountain that overlooked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Level--a street of spacious distances and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant phonies. Three streets ran to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slide from the business portion of the Level,</seg><seg type="columnLine">up one of which the two men climbed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is he?"- gasped Jonas, as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the terrace, which was dimly lit</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shaded by trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Down here a bit," answered the other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning to the south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jonas followed. Then he felt something</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a sack thrown over his head. His feet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were kicked from under him. Ropes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">deftly fastened round his arms and legs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was raised on the shoulders of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">captors, hurried first over smooth and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough ground, and at length, half suffo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated, shaken by his fall and suffering from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shock of his abduction, he lost con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Jonas recovered his senses he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself lying on a heap of sacks in</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was evidently the deserted working of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mine.

It was also evident that his cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture had been carefully planned--the ruse</seg><seg type="columnLine">by which he had been lured from his home</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Where is young Allen ?

A request for a drink</seg><seg type="columnLine">of' water had been refused. His mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't respond to his attempts to arrange</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thoughts in coherent order.

Then again, young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Allen's prospects would be badly blighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and he loved the lad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If he refused to comply with the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mands, Allen and the boy and, unluckily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whopple would prosper, be happy, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder at the mysterious disappearance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old man whom the Allens had loved,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and who had loved them so much in turn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jonas almost wished that he had insured</seg><seg type="columnLine">his life, as Allen had suggested, for then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wouldn't be in such a fix.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, he extracted a grain of com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fort from the fact that if he still refused</seg><seg type="columnLine">JONAS AND HIS CONVECTIONS.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">551</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to do the gang's bidding, and they carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">out their threats, the boy would be none</seg><seg type="columnLine">the worse for that.

Spurred by the conviction that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about to be deprived not only of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that makes life worth living, but of life</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, by a band of outlaws, the blind rage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the thwarted fell upon him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men were sleeping about him, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">having been ordered to stay awake and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch the prisoner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ere the sentry could arm himself, Jonas</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed a chunk of smoldering wood from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire and felled hint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was an outer)-.

E., Garber, Missouri," ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion 4, in your February number, you appear</seg><seg type="columnLine">to misunderstand the question, " Is it safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an operator to recopy train-orders?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shall consider it a favor to reply to this very</seg><seg type="columnLine">important question. There are two ways of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">copying train-orders:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1.	The inexperienced man, or beginner, in re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiving train orders from the despatcher is liable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take a poor copy by reason of nervousness, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his inability to receive and write down</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast sending. Hence he may be tempted, after re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peating the order and receiving the despatcher's</seg><seg type="columnLine">" O. K.," to make a new copy to display his best</seg><seg type="columnLine">handwriting. This procedure consigns the copy</seg><seg type="columnLine">received from the despatcher, to the waste-basket.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This plan is dangerous and must not only be dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">couraged, but positively forbidden. The writer</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows of an instance where two passenger-trains</seg><seg type="columnLine">running at high speed collided owing to an opera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor recopying the train-order his despatcher had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sent him, and, inadvertently inserting the wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting-point in so doing. Several persons were</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed or injured in the wreck, and the property</seg><seg type="columnLine">loss was very heavy. The better plan is for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operator to issue the original copy to trainmen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if it is not written as neatly as he is capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of writing, remembering that the inexperienced</seg><seg type="columnLine">of to-day who is careful is the old-timer of to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow. whose accurate work and neat penman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship arc known all over the division.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 2.	An operator having received a train-order,</seg><seg type="columnLine">may find that he has insufficient copies for all con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerned. This may occur when trains are tied up</seg><seg type="columnLine">by floods, washouts, or wrecks. In this instance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he should set up the required number of extra</seg><seg type="columnLine">copies, place his original " correct copy " thereon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with stylus or hard pencil, trace each and</seg><seg type="columnLine">every letter and figure.
