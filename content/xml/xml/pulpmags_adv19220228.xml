I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the same fix as nine out of ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">other men. Expenses were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly mounting and my salary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although it had increased, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not keep pace with the cost of liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. My wife had to do without</seg><seg type="columnLine">things that I knew she ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have. We wanted an automobile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but we couldn't afford it. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to buy our own home, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't afford that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It made me desperate to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what might happen if I became</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick or lost my job. I worried about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and so did my wife. We were living from hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">to mouth, and we didn't know what calamity and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardships might be lurking just around the corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And yet--today--I own our nine-room house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have an automobile.

One day in glancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a magazine I read an advertisement. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">advertisement said that any man could make from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred to three hundred dollars a month during</seg><seg type="columnLine">his spare time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I didn't believe it. I knew that I worked hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight hours a day for $50 a week, and I figured that</seg><seg type="columnLine">no man could make that much during a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours a day spare time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as I read that ad I found that it pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to men who had made that much and more. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last paragraph the advertiser offered to send a book</seg><seg type="columnLine">without cost. I still doubted. But I thought it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was worth a two-cent stamp, so I tore out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coupon and put it in my pocket, and the next day</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my way home from work I mailed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I look back to that day and realize how</seg><seg type="columnLine">close I came to 'passing up that ad, it sends cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">chills down my spine. If the book had cost me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand dollars instead of a two-cent stamp, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would still have been cheap. All that I have today.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">--an automobile, my home, an established business,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a contented family--all these are due to the things</seg><seg type="columnLine">I learned by reading that little eight-page booklet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is no secret to my success.

NEXT morning the sun rose in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cloudless sky, giving promise of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a terriffically hot day, so Tex and</seg><seg type="columnLine">George Hickman, his observer, decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get an early start for Donovan Field before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mounting sun made the flying bumpy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Consequently it was only seven-thirty when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sergeant Cary, chief mechanic of the flight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to warm up the big four hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fifty horsepower Liberty motor in Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dowell's DeHaviland plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex, who was engineer officer and test</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot of the flight, was to test a new De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haviland at Donovan Field and fly it back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to McMullen, leaving the old ship there for</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhaul and repair, it having had its</seg><seg type="columnLine">allotted number of hours in the air. Big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blondely handsome Hickman was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">along just to take a look at San Antonio and</seg><seg type="columnLine">see a show. Early as it was, Pete Mills and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wallace had started on the eastern morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">patrol, and Binder and Cravath were fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles on their way westward along the Rio</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grande.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> MacDowell and Hickman, swinging their</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmets and goggles in their hands, strolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the mess-hall toward the ship, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been started and was idling gently. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">air was quiet, for it was too early for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gulf breeze to be stirring. The airdrome,</seg><seg type="columnLine">four hundred yards square, was bounded on</seg><seg type="columnLine">three sides by hangars, frame barracks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mess-halls and storehouses. Their ship was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the line in front of the hangars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The roar of the motor increased as Cary</seg><seg type="columnLine">slid the throttle forward a trifle. The wheels</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to press against the blocks that held</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and the two mechanics who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding each wing set themselves to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship. Little by little the throttle crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward under the sergeant's careful hand,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">until the man sitting on the tail to keep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship from nosing up was compelled to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back and lean against the propellor</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast. For a few seconds the noise of twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty cylinders firing in rotation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost deafening, and then as slowly as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor had been turned on it was cut down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to idling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex and Hickman fastened their helmet</seg><seg type="columnLine">straps and adjusted their goggles as Cary</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed out of the cockpit. The pilot ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">justed his belt, tried both switches, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied air, oil, and temperature gages</seg><seg type="columnLine">briefly. He turned around and Hickman</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded that he was ready. Tex signalled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mechanics, who pulled the wheel blocks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There being no wind, he slowly pushed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throttle and spark ahead until both were</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide open. A little pressure on the stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the tail came up. For a hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">they roared across the ground, and then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard-packed sand dropped away beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex hunched down further behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">windshield, as they circled the field, to es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cape the terrific pressure of air which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the result of their whirring propeller and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred miles an hour of airspeed. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">circles of the field brought them up to two</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet and assured him that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor was running well. He banked around</seg><seg type="columnLine">and headed north for the two hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty mile grind to Donovan Field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There being no particular hurry, he fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed the railroad. It was thirty miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">shorter to fly an airline straight across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mesquite, but along the railroad there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few fields which might be possible landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">places if the motor cut out. To the border</seg><seg type="columnLine">patrol flyer, accustomed to gamble his life</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his motor as he flew for hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">over trackless mesquite, it seemed very</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable to have any cleared places at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all below him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was thoroughly characteristic of Tex</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take the railroad course instead of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">airline, although the average person who</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew him would expect him to take a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the shorter but more dangerous route.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had won his reputation as the premier</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot of the border by a succession of</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant, often reckless, flying achieve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments. A dozen times his fellow pilots had</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him stall down in a DeHaviland,</seg><seg type="columnLine">than which there is no more ticklish or</seg><seg type="columnLine">expert bit of flying, and gasped at the chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was taking. But in doing that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Feud's End</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">depending on his ability to handle the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Should he take the airline to San Antonio,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no skill of his could save a crackup, perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">death to both passengers, in the event of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a forced landing in the thick mesquite.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Consequently, inasmuch as there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">need for haste, he did the safest thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex possessed, unconsciously perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great confidence in himself that was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">result of experience and self-knowledge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">minus conceit. Nine out of ten people who</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew him only by reputation would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubbed their eyes with wonder that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should take the safest course. When Tex</seg><seg type="columnLine">became reckless, it was a calculating reck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessness that depended little on the infalli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility of an airplane motor and much on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying ability of Tex MacDowell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A half-hour, and the ship had climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually to five thousand feet. The edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mesquite wilderness, a hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty miles long, slipped behind them. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left, as far as the eye could see, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrubby forest of grayish-green billowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">away to the skyline. The ship was slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">right-wing heavy, but nevertheless the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sturdy motor drew it through the air at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred miles an hour, even though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was throttled down to fifteen hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolutions a minute. Once in a while Tex</seg><seg type="columnLine">was compelled to pump the air, which failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold up to three pounds, but otherwise</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old ship seemed to have escaped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effects of age.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The last fifty miles of the trip, which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">over more open country, were rather bumpy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the rapidly heating atmosphere started</seg><seg type="columnLine">currents of warm and cold air that reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">even to five thousand feet. Both airmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">were glad to see the level expanse of Dono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">van Field come into view, the mile-long</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows of hangars, barracks and machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">shops standing out vividly white against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green. Tex started to dive when he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still ten miles from the field, throttling his</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor to twelve hundred. By taking a long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradual dive with motor partly on, over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast cooling was prevented, and the spark</seg><seg type="columnLine">plugs would not foul. Right to the last the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great Liberty did its duty--every gage read</seg><seg type="columnLine">correctly as the big ship shot over the south-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern edge of Donovan Field and the motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">went full on again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex circled the field at five hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look at the landing T.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed dropped to seventy five, then to</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventy miles an hour. For just an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship seemed to hover and the pilot</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked back on the stick. The tail came</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and they landed smoothly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   L AS THEY taxied to the line oppo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">9 site hangar 11, where visiting ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">were always taken care of, the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">border pilots looked around them appreci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atively. After the small, difficult airdrome</seg><seg type="columnLine">at McMullen it was almost imposing even</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them to watch a dozen ships at a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing and taking off all around the mile-</seg><seg type="columnLine">square field about them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They found a niche on the line between</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little S.

They were standing beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">border ship before mechanics had a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get blocks under the wheels. Tex nodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Harrow, and then shut off his gas flow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a half-minute the motor gurgled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spit, and then the propeller gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped.

Carruthers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer in charge of the course for engineer</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers, brought Tex the message. Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dowell was hard at work putting together</seg><seg type="columnLine">the internal workings of a torn-down Liberty</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor. The Mechanics School believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that for every lecture on the theory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">motors there should be many hours devoted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to getting the hands dirty and learning by</seg><seg type="columnLine">actual experience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Lord, Carruthers, have I got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosey down and clean up right now?" in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired Tex disgustedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Unless you want to interview the Major</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that spiffy suit of coveralls," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carruthers, who was a slight, good-looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow with a pair of sparkling brown eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a flashing smile that helped to make him</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the most popular men on the field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had been a senior in a prominent</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineering school at the start of the war,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and incidentally held one or two New</seg><seg type="columnLine">England Intercollegiate records on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">track.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They may not be the glass of fashion,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed Tex, carefully wiping and then wrap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping up his tools, "but they're cool."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't see why.

I'll take</seg><seg type="columnLine">you down to the quarters on the motorcycle</seg><seg type="columnLine">so you can change."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex locked up his tools in a chest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then with Carruthers at his side walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the long hangar, where dozens of</seg><seg type="columnLine">students--commissioned and enlisted--were</seg><seg type="columnLine">working busily under the guidance of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structors. Two lecture rooms at the far</seg><seg type="columnLine">end were filled to overflowing with classes</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were getting lecture periods. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mechanics School was the mechanic-factory</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Air Service, and Major Stratton saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it that production was fast and thorough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carruthers started the motorcycle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex folded up his long legs and eased him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self into the sidecar. He showed no effects in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his manner or face of the difficult two weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had passed since the discovery of</seg><seg type="columnLine">opium in his ship. Being under confine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, he had not been off the field during</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time, but for days the newspapers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">San Antonio had played up the story, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">vague hints of a huge smuggling conspiracy</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was using Army airplanes to trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port the contraband goods. The name Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dowell, hitherto prominent as the hero of</seg><seg type="columnLine">many flying exploits, was spread across</seg><seg type="columnLine">newspaper pages during those days as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first of many important criminals who</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be taught a lesson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the Mechanics School itself, after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first day or two, Tex had effortlessly estab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lished himself as a "real guy." His whimsi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal humor, lack of conceit, and above all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">refusal 4.0 allow the fact that he was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">i6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">confinement for an important crime to</seg><seg type="columnLine">affect either his sense of humor or his at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">titude toward his work, speedily convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Busy young officers of the School that</seg><seg type="columnLine">regardless of the fact that he might be guilty</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was an addition to the gang. He won</seg><seg type="columnLine">their money at poker, flew their scout ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they had seldom been flown before and</seg><seg type="columnLine">refused absolutely to discuss the charges</seg><seg type="columnLine">against him in any way. Futhermore, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of pumping could persuade him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">launch forth into tales of his achievements</seg><seg type="columnLine">overseas or on the border. As a result, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attitude of the School's young men was</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressed by "Slim" Evans a few days after</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had all come to know the man of whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had heard so much.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He may be guilty, or he may not,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated Slim around the mess-table one</seg><seg type="columnLine">night when Tex was absent, "and personally</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	don't give a-whether he is or not!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Which attitude Tex must have noticed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but if he did he gave no indication that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized his peculiar position among his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother officers. Right now he was wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing whether the wheels were beginning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">move. Had MacDowell, senior, accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plished anything? Carruthers being asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to report likewise, however, made it rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">improbable that the major wanted to talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the opium bu'siness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carruthers sat and smoked while Tex</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly bathed and dressed. The young</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer, only a fair pilot himself through</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of opportunity to make flying his chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">business in the Army, was secretly a pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">found admirer of the seasoned veteran who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one of his motor students. Being of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensitive disposition, he realized better than</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the others just how much poise and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold nerve it took for the Texan to conduct</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself naturally, and carve a niche for</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in the Mechanics School under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances. Jack Carruthers was for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex, hook, line and sinker, and as they sped</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward headquarters for the interview with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the major he was almost hoping that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be of such a nature as would give him</seg><seg type="columnLine">an opportunity to demonstrate his loyalty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both men waited with interest for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">major to bring up the subject of the inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">view. For a moment, however, he insisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">on discussing with Tex the advantages of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sideslip landing. He had seen him make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a beauty that morning, and, unlike most</seg><seg type="columnLine">high-ranking officers, the major was a real</seg><seg type="columnLine">flyer himself, which meant that he was ready</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to discuss flying at all times when a kindred</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul was around to discuss it with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally he came to the reason for asking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two men to report.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Captain Barrett, from Washington, took</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ship from here to fly to the Corbett Ranch</seg><seg type="columnLine">two days ago," he said.

Well, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain got lost in a fog and landed near a</seg><seg type="columnLine">town called Ausman, Texas, down on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gulf of Mexico. It was muddy and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned over on his back. Broke the prop,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wheel, jimmed up the rudder and various</seg><seg type="columnLine">other minor injuries.

He wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether Tex suspected that his C. O. had</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliberately pulled wires to give him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip. Mrs. Stratton was a Texas girl, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar with what the name MacDowell</seg><seg type="columnLine">had meant in Texas since old Roaring Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">had first become a cattleman back in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighties. Not that Mrs. Stratton could re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member the eighties, but her father had</seg><seg type="columnLine">many a tale to tell of the old days when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">and MacDowell, senior, and a few other</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardy souls had fought their way by main</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength to a commanding position in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lone Star State.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The major himself was not in charge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most important single activity of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Air Service for nothing--he knew men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he agreed thoroughly with his wife that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all probability Tex was a most unfortunate</seg><seg type="columnLine">victim of circumstances. The C. O. turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to his work in a righteous glow--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">assignment would mean something to Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dowell in more ways than one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It did, and in more ways than even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">major could possibly have in mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEIR sturdy training-plane was</seg><seg type="columnLine">well loaded down next morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">when MacDowell and Carruthers</seg><seg type="columnLine">took off. A propeller was wired to one wing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">next to the fuselage. A spare wheel took up</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the available space in the under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">carriage, tied between struts. A rudder was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied securely to the other wing, in such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner that it did not rest on its base and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">twist out of shape. A suitcase holding the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 2</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">toilet kits and a change of linen for the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">flyers was strapped next to the rudder. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back cockpit a tool kit, extra spark</seg><seg type="columnLine">plugs, new distributor brushes and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, easily broken and vitally important</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts of an aviation motor were stuffed</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the seat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a gray, cloudy day, although it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not cold and the clouds were high. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind was blowing southeast from the Gulf,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which meant that the hundred-and-seventy</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile trip would be made in slow time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As always when he was flying anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the heavy, overpowered, unbalanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">DeHaviland, Tex felt carefree. The De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haviland is so infinitely more difficult to</seg><seg type="columnLine">land safely in the event of a forced landing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">due to its weight and high landing speed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">plus the fact that its undercarriage is set</seg><seg type="columnLine">too far back and the plane will nose up at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slightest provocation, that almost any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other ship seems like "pie" to a pilot ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">customed to DeHavilands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His map was fastened in front of him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacked down on a mapboard. At two thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand feet he picked up the railroad to Barnes</seg><seg type="columnLine">City, throttled his hundred-and-eighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">horsepower motor to 1,450 r.p.m., and flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">southeast. There were plenty of large fields</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the motor went bad, although water was</seg><seg type="columnLine">discernible in many of them. It had rained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barnes City where they were to make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first stop, was the eighth town down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroad, marked by a reservoir. The field,</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintained by the Government as a landing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">place for cadets on their practice cross-</seg><seg type="columnLine">country flights, was next to the reservoir.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They picked up the field without trouble,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Tex spiraled down slowly while he gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landing-ground a careful scrutiny.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a pool of water at one end, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">otherwise it looked fairly hard. The ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proach for a landing into the wind was</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly over the town. At a thousand feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the town he cut the throttle to idling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cocked up the Jenny until it was in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost vertical bank. Top rudder started</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to slipping down with very little forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed. He leveled out at a hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and glided slowly, dropping over the trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the edge of the field and stalling down -</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground. A slow landing is good</seg><seg type="columnLine">policy in any strange field--a small bump</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a very shallow ditch may wreck a fast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing ship. Townspeople could be seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing in the middle of the streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">i8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">watching the sight that never seems to lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">novelty--an airplane in flight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The field was short the way they landed--</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than a hundred and fifty yards, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow landing caused them to stop rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">with half the space unused. Tex taxied to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the road which ran by the field,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had just cut his motor when the gas</seg><seg type="columnLine">truck from a garage which supplied Govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment ships with high-test gas came bouncing</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the rough highway. It was a matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of only a few minutes to refill the half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty gas and oil tanks, make out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary vouchers and get the ship cranked</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the warm-up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carruthers placed a couple of sizeable</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks under the wheels for blocks and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat on the tail while MacDowell warmed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor. At about eight hundred revs, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed and backfired a few times, but quick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly caught again and ran smoothly when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally opened the throttle wide for a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds. Tex turned to Carruthers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded. The motor man crawled beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wings, picked out the stones and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed to his seat and strapped himself in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex gave it the gun slowly. He was tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing off toward the reservoir--it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cross-wind take-off, but it gave him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long way of the field and a Jenny is slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting off the ground. For a moment the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor missed and then caught ag in</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoothly. The ship left the ground and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was twenty-five feet high as it reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the two-hundred-yard square reser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voir. Tex threw it into a left-hand bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a turn back toward the field. Without</seg><seg type="columnLine">any warning one bank of cylinders cut com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely out and there was a loud report as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the motor backfired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The reservoir was surrounded by trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shrubbery. There was but one opening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely twenty-five feet wide, directly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of them. Like a flash Tex nosed down</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ship and dived for the opening. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no hope of getting over the tops of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees. Carruthers, in the back seat, pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his goggles and protected his face with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm, preparing for the inevitable crash.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their wing spread was forty-seven feet--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opening little more than half that much.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex dived steeply for speed--he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">skimming the water twenty yards away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the aperture in the trees. One bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cylinders lent them a little aid. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sped closer to his goal he took the desperate</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance that he had decided 011 an instant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">after the motor's failure. He banked steep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, his ship so close to the ground that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower wing tip was barely a foot above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. The tiniest slip--which seemed in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">evitable as the ship lost speed--would cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wing to catch the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The banked ship curved through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow opening, and with all the flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense the years had given him Tex fought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep it in the air. They were scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the screen of bushes when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">jammed the stick over the other way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring it back to level. He was just too late</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the right wheel hit the ground first and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they bounced eight feet, cocked up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right and a'most stalled in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the instinct of a born flyer, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex anticipated the action of the ship and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had pushed the stick forward almost jjefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bounce occurred. He caught the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time, and it landed correctly instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose-diving the eight feet, which it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done had there been a split second's</seg><seg type="columnLine">delay in nosing down when the ship bounced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had it reached the height of the bounce be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the action of the controls caught it, fly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing speed would have been completely gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE whole maneuver had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">about five seconds, and had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">series of instantaneous decisions, any</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of which meant the difference between</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wreck and possible safety. The ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped rolling a few feet from an irrigation</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditch, one of several that cut the field. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels were an inch deep in the soft ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">--had the ground not been so saturated</seg><seg type="columnLine">with moisture they would have rolled into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ditch and all MacDowelPs efforts gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">for naught.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex pushed up his goggles and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look at Carruthers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So this is Paris!" he observed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carruthers drew a deep breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Excuse me if I seem to act peculiar,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he replied with a deep breath. "But I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking hands with St. Peter and just let</seg><seg type="columnLine">go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they climbed out of the ship a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">came running toward them, leading a group</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men, women and children from near-by</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses who had heard the motor go bad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Can't take off in this field, if we can fix</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship," said Tex disgustedly.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was removed easily by means of a piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wire.

It went</seg><seg type="columnLine">Feud's End</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">21</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">straight east for forty miles and then bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply southward to Acacia. Ausman was</seg><seg type="columnLine">southeast of Acacia. The map showed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small river which would serve as a landmark</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a straight course for their destination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a deserted strip of country, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty miles. One tiny group of buildings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably belonging to a ranchman, was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only evidence of human habitation that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two airmen could discern. At intervals</seg><seg type="columnLine">herds of cattle could be seen, standing out</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply in the clear air, even from five</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally the river bent northward, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no landmark to guide them. Tex</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew due southeast by his compass. As the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying-time from Barnes City grew to fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes and then an hour Tex scanned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country ahead anxiously. The railroad</seg><seg type="columnLine">running south of Ausman should be in sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">by then--the Gulf itself only a few miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A white streak ahead became visible. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a highway, running almost north and</seg><seg type="columnLine">south. The pilot studied his map carefully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was evidently the highway which ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached Ausman from the south. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted too far to the south while flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">without landmarks on the ground to guide</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Perhaps the prevailing wind at five</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet had been from the north and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blown them off course. At any rate, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be far from their goal. Ten miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">further eastward the waters of the Gulf</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be seen shimmering through the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground haze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He banked around to follow the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">northward. It was wide, and looked as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was smooth and level. It was probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">a boulevard used by the big Summer colony</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Corpus Christi, many miles south, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">automobiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he flew above the road he noticed two</seg><seg type="columnLine">automobiles, coming from opposite direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. The one going north toward Ausman</seg><seg type="columnLine">was traveling very fast. The other car,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a much smaller one, was proceeding slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Both Tex and Carruthers watched the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">cars idly. It was pleasant to have some</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence of inhabited country after the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">.jaunt over the trackless, lonesome wastes</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had just traversed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the two cars approached each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fast-running one did not slow down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like two toys they sped toward each other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the flyers watched helplessly as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the smaller car skid, topple and finally</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">turn over beside the road. The big car had</seg><seg type="columnLine">collided with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex cut the throttle half-way and dived</seg><seg type="columnLine">recklessly for the ground. The wires</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed with the speed, but not until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">struts were shaking and the whole ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrating wildly did Tex pull up the nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a minute to reduce it. Then he cocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the ship in a vertical bank and with full</seg><seg type="columnLine">top rudder sent it into a wicked sideslip</seg><seg type="columnLine">that made them drop like a stone. The side</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind blew his goggles around with its force</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was compelled to hold them in place</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the back seat Carruthers had his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">glued to the nasty looking wreck below.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The big car had stopped and the figure of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man could be seen approaching the mangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">little victim of his reckless driving. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no sign of life from beneath the wreck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they sped earthward Tex looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiously for a place to land. The country</seg><seg type="columnLine">was swampy and isolated clumps of bushes</seg><seg type="columnLine">effectually spoiled any of the open places</seg><seg type="columnLine">for airplane-landing purposes. The pilot</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped that the big car was all right and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would not be forced to land, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospects were very bad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were only fifteen hundred feet high</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he felt Carruthers' hand gripping his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder; He turned, and Carruthers point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed down excitedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A woman," were the syllables his lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed, and Tex stuck his head far over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side of the cockpit, holding his goggles</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prevent their turning in the terrific air</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast generated by the dive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sure enough, the figure of a woman in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort of a white blouse was discernible</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, and the man seemed to be simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing beside her. Certainly he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to help her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a layout that demanded a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigation, Tex decided, but where on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth could he land with any chance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety? There was not a possible place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He scanned the road keenly. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">no wires or trees to hinder, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty wide enough. The few bushes</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be far enough back so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings would clear them. Instantly he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided to risk it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A half-mile back of the two cars he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly over the road, a hundred feet high.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He cut the throttle completely, and glided</seg><seg type="columnLine">22</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. The southeast wind started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drift him a little, so he nosed into it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came down with his ship pointed slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">diagonal to the wide, straight highway. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">comforting thing in his ticklish job was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ditches alongside the road were eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet from the edge of the road proper, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently very shallow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carruthers, despite his realization of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty of what Tex was attempting, felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">as safe as if he had been in church, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterward expressed it. Somehow or other</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had abounding confidence in the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was piloting him--more than he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have had in himself, which is the highest</seg><seg type="columnLine">compliment one pilot can pay another.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Probably fifty per cent, of flyers refuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely to ride with anybody but them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves at the stick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex almost stalled his ship five feet from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roadway. As it dropped he kicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rudder so that the nose was pointed'</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly down the road. Although they hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard, it was on three points and they did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not bounce. Peering ahead with his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the side to give him better vision, Tex</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked his rudder desperately to keep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship going straight as it lost speed and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls began to become ineffective.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was lucky--when the ship started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come to a stop it did not take a notion</seg><seg type="columnLine">to deviate from its straight path. Had it</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to turn, he would have been forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to turn on the throttle to make the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trols effective, and if they had not worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately the extra speed would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant a crack-up in a ditch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had scarcely stopped rolling, a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards from the cars, when Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruthers was out of the cockpit. He grabbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left hand wing, out at the end, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked along as Tex taxied slowly forward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By alternately pulling or pushing on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wing Carruthers helped keep the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling straight, and in a moment they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">close by the heap of torn metal that rep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">resented the woman's car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex left the motor idling and followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carruthers at a run. The man was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">kneeling alongside the woman, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched partly beneath the wreckage. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed a little as he leaned over her, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the approaching airmen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they came up to him he turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up. Apparently he was either a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexican or at least a half-breed. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stout, with a dark, full face that was now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">flushed with liquor. It was a girl who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched unconscious on the ground, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her shirtwaist and skirt were torn and dirty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not until they were right beside the drunk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enly leering Mexican did the two army men</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that one of his hands rested on a white</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder which was exposed by the torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">blouse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carruthers grabbed the Mexican by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">collar and jerked him to his feet. He drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">back his foot and with all the strength he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sent the Mexican sprawling with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-placed kick. Tex bent over the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiously. An ugly clot of blood on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head might mean almost anything, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">limp, unnaturally bent arm told its own</seg><seg type="columnLine">story. It was broken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked up in time to see the Mexican,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was dressed flashily, climb to his feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His face was contorted with drunken rage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He started for Carruthers, tugging at a gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hip pocket. He did not notice Tex</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the flyer leaped for him. A crashing blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the ear sent him to earth once more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this time he lay still. Tex abstracted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gun and rolled him to the side of the road.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thanks, Tex," said Carruthers briefly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Her arm's broken and she may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything from a fractured skull to just a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bruise on her head," stated Tex, as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent over the victim of the accident.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was very young and more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinarily good looking, although now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oval face was chalk-white beneath a tum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling mass of auburn hair that shone like</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire in the sunlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carruthers wet his handkerchief with</seg><seg type="columnLine">water from the ditch and carefully washed</seg><seg type="columnLine">away the blood from the girl's head. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was starting to clot over an ugly gash just</seg><seg type="columnLine">over her left ear. Apparently, however, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound was not serious, but the misshapen</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm was pitifully obvious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I feel as helpless as a - baby!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">groaned Carruthers. "How far are we from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ausman, anyway?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About fifteen miles, I think," returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex. "We've got to get her back someway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If that spig's car is all right, you can drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to Ausman."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Had we better try to bring her to?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't believe so. That arm will prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably give her- if she comes out of her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">faint, and we might as well let her alone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll take a lcJok at the car."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carruthers, who had the girl's head in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lap, bandaged the cut on her head while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Feud's End</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex started for the car. He was doomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to disappointment. One wheel was crazily</seg><seg type="columnLine">askew and two blown tires showed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big machine must have skidded wildly after</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitting the other car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing doing," yelled Tex as he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. "I wonder if anybody ever drives</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">along this-forsaken pike?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Apparently not. But we've got to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">something, Tex."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your words are as true as gospel, me</seg><seg type="columnLine">lad, but starting from there--what?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at the girl speculatively and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then at the softly idling ship. Carruthers</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught his unspoken thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Could we flv her in, do you think?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe we could," decided Tex, his-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes on the road that stretched away as</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight as a string for miles. "You'd have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold her in, though."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What about landing? My-, if any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing should happen-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got full directions for the field, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Correll knows enough to pick a good one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It hasn't been raining here since yesterday,</seg><seg type="columnLine">either. Probably he'll be out to meet us in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a car, and we can rush her to a doctor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All righ --let's go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carruthers ently eased himself away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the girl and propped up her head on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cushion which Tex supplied. They ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the ship and each took one side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail. They lifted it a few inches off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground and carefully swung it around, care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful not to raise it too high, for in that event</seg><seg type="columnLine">the revolving propeller would hit the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When it was pointed down the road they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back to the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you think about a sling for</seg><seg type="columnLine">that arm?" inquired Tex. "I believe it</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to be bound up, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They finally took two pieces of board</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bound up her arm in a rough splint. Tex</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripped off his O. D. shirt and made a sling</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of it. The girl stirred as they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">applying the rough surgery, but apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not regain consciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were preparing to carry her to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship when Tex remarked--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If we're going to town it might be wise</seg><seg type="columnLine">to--er--cover up the young lady."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carruthers grinned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's where I lose my shirt, too, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess," he said as he took it off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was needed, for there was very little</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirtwaist left and much creamy skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They slipped Carruthers' O.D. shirt over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl's head, putting only her uninjured</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm through a sleeve.

Before she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak a spasm of pain twisted her features.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh--my arm!" she said faintly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It got pretty badly hurt in that crash,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied Carruthers, settling her head more</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortably on his shoulder.

"How is the damsel in distress?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Fine, thank you," responded the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a crooked little smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex grinned appreciatively at the game-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness displayed by the delicate-appearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">young woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't object to a ride in the plane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you?" he asked as he and Carruthers</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted her gently to carry her to the ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The quicker a doctor gets hold of you the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quicker that pain is going to stop."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think it will almost be worth a broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm," she told them as they slowly walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Climb in, Jack, and I'll strap you," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">24</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex, and held the girl in his arms as Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruthers loosened his hold and quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as he was strapped securely Tex</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted his burden over the side of the cock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit and lowered her into Jack's lap. Careful</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they were, the girl's face went white with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain as MacDowell's arm stirred the sling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She leaned back lifelessly as Tex tucked her</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet as far back as possible to avoid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibility of jamming the controls in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear cockpit. Carruthers had his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked around her, he himself held in secure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly by the strap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex climbed into the front cockpit and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strapped himself. Before starting he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">another brief look at the directions Correll</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sent for the field. It was marked by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">big barn on one side and the mechanic</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have a T contructed in the best part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the held. The wrecked ship would be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an adjoining field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He slowly turned on the throttle. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">take-off presented much less difficulty than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landing on the road, because the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be going at top speed, and even on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground would readily answer the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trols. It was comparatively easy for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep it straight down the road by gentle</seg><seg type="columnLine">use of the rudder, although once he had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">swerve slightly to avoid hitting a bush with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wing. Speed was picked up quickly on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hard surface, and they were safely off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground in a hundred yards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS THEY circled around toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ausman Tex glanced down and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Mexican walking slowly toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">his damaged automobile. The pilot watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">his instruments with tense interest. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not dare to let himself think of what a</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced landing would mean. Even the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not a possibility now, for the shrub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bery seemed to be closer and the ditches</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper as they came in sight of a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">village that must be Ausman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were fifteen hundred feet high, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they came closer to town a big white T</seg><seg type="columnLine">loomed up plainly. Tex blessed the wise old</seg><seg type="columnLine">sergeant who knew that a T was the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">best bet in landmarks from the air. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">barn was there, too, and in another field</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wrecked ship, now right-side up, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be plainly seen. Several cars were standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the narrow little road that ran past the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field, branching off from the main pike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he spiraled down with half-throttled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">motor Tex flew more carefully than he ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">had before, striving to counteract the bumps</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air so that the girl would be jarred</seg><seg type="columnLine">as little as possible. In the back seat Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruthers, holding his burden tightly, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">indulging in silent paens of praise and</seg><seg type="columnLine">admiration. Scarcely once did the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">tilt sharply--Tex was literally catching it</seg><seg type="columnLine">before it started. And in the blaze of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon sun the air was in a highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambled condition as they came down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">live hundred feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The field looked good. The portion where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the T was located was apparently level and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry, although at one end of the long, narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretch a sizeable pool of water could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen. The smoke from Ausman chimneys</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rising almost straight in the air, Tex</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted, so the wind was of little consequence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He circled carefully well back from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">southern boundary of the field and with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand on the throttle started a very gradual</seg><seg type="columnLine">dive. Imperceptibly the throttle crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">back farther and farther, the nose coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">down slightly to compensate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shot for the field could not have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">more accurate. They skimmed the fence</seg><seg type="columnLine">at about fifty-five miles an hour, and Tex</seg><seg type="columnLine">leveled off with his wheels almost touching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground. He inched the tail back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed as smoothly as it is humanly pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible to set a ship down. It stopped op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posite the line-up of cars, so it was only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short taxi to the nearfest one. Tex looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">around as he fed the throttle slowly, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship barely moving across the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl's face was deathly white below</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carruthers' huge goggles, which obscured</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything except the tip of her nose, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth and chin; but she managed a smile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nevertheless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Correll was in the van of the group of peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple who had come out to see the landing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex wasted no time in cutting his switches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling in spite of himself at the stark</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishment pictured on the faces of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen or so people who surrounded the ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Correll, a huge, portly man whose massive</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs looked like tree-trunks in Army breeches</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leggings, was speechless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There was an auto wreck and we brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">this girl in," said Tex crisply as he climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. "Will the person who has the biggest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">easiest riding car volunteer to take her</seg><seg type="columnLine">home and some one else to go for a doctor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, its Corinne Weston!" exclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a motherly looking woman as Tex and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Feud's End</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">25</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Correll lifted the girl out and removed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">goggles. "I'll take her home, poor dear!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How far does she live from here?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex as they carried her to the big touring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">car the woman was driving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About a mile--on the outskirts of town,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she replied breathlessly, bustling wildly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get robes out of the way in the back seat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm all alone--maybe one o' you gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men better come along to hold her and h.elp</seg><seg type="columnLine">her into the house.

I'll be over to get my</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt back in a few minutes," said Tex.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carruthers, who had been unconscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his lightly clad condition, flushed red as</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire, glancing quickly at the portly lady who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was already at the wheel of the car. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">little knot of curious people laughed at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismayed expression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Land's sake, boy, hop in and don't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">silly," said the lady.

All the old-timers were familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it, and in countless small towns his</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming was looked forward to as one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading events of the year, rivaling in im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portance a county-seat barbecue, baseball</seg><seg type="columnLine">championship game and band concert com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bined.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ran an old-time Wild West show, pure</seg><seg type="columnLine">and simple. The show carried a string of</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty or more horses, mostly either natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">or trained buckers, and he always managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have at least a couple of outlaws that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were really tough medicine for the best of</seg><seg type="columnLine">riders. He carried eight or ten riders and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ropers, the number varying greatly accord-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the personal idiosyncrasies of the per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formers, who were all cowhands who wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Feud's End</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">3i</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to try something new. Drumm's daughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maisie was heavily billed as the world's</seg><seg type="columnLine">champion woman rider, roper and shot, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to an unprejudiced eye the claim was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly exaggerated, although as far as any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body knew, Maisie had no official right to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the title.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A small carnival which included a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">variety of side-shows, always traveled along</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the show, and owing to the wide ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quaintance of Bogie Bill his show usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">took on the aspect of a town fair. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forty-nine Girls, Fatima, the Fat Woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a few midgets had been institutions with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the show ever since it started. It might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">added that a number of too skillful card</seg><seg type="columnLine">players and other light-fingered gentry had</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled along with Drumm for so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">years that every one in Texas should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">known them, and in fact a lot of people did.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nevertheless, when the show was in town it</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared as if "everything went," in good</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Western style.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some few days before the arrival of Tex</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacDowell in Ausman the show pitched its</seg><seg type="columnLine">tents in South' San Antonio, less than a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the eastern entrance of Donovan Field</seg><seg type="columnLine">and about three miles from the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city. It had been a long time since Drumm</seg><seg type="columnLine">had essayed a big town, and apparently the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance was a good one, for at eight o'clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">every seat was full and the sidewalls had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been rolled up to allow standees to peek</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the aisle-spaces at a quarter each.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The carnival side-shows were doing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing business, and the hoarse cries of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barkers split the air with raucous sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">that almost drowned the wheezes and groans</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a couple of hurdy-gurdies. Flaring gaso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line torches illumined the grounds fitfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The show was in three sections. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">first section consisted of fancy riding of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">descriptions, done by Bogie's staff of riders</seg><seg type="columnLine">and climaxed by the work of his daughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maisie. Then there was roping and fancy</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting, and finally the big feature of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">show--the riding of bucking ponies. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">grand finale was an attempt by every rider</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the outfit to stick on the two outlaws,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a standing reward of fifty dollars in</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold to any one in the audience who could</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay on "Sunfish," a mangy, bony old war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse who was named for his polished and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual ability at performing that well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known maneuver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first section was well under way, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bogie Bill, a squat, jovial, red-faced old</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">veteran of the West, was rubbing his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleefully at the interest the show had</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused in San Antonio. He saw a solid week</seg><seg type="columnLine">of good business at the one stand, if his luck</seg><seg type="columnLine">held and he got a good weather break.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was "Blackie" Stearns' turn to show,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for some reason he did not appear on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little black pony. As the wait became</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer Drumm's face grew dark. Stearns</seg><seg type="columnLine">had caused him trouble before--he wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether he had got hold of liquor again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was starting back for the horse tent</seg><seg type="columnLine">when finally the flaps separating the canvas</seg><seg type="columnLine">corral and the main tent opened and Stearns</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared on Black Bess. He was extremely</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall, long legged and broad shouldered, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of his rather handsome face</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoiled by a deep frown that seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">everpresent. Drumm noted with rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrath that there was a flush on his rider's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face tonight that bespoke indulgence in</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Barleycorn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he entered the riding tent Stearns</seg><seg type="columnLine">roweled his little black horse viciously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The mare, taken by surprize, bucked so</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly that the tall rider was nearly un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated. Stearns was a good rider--better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than most of the staff Drumm carried with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the show--but the unlooked-for pitch of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse, plus the overload of liquor that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried, made him look suspiciously like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tyro.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Haw, haw, haw!" came loudly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stout, loud-voiced man on the front row.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ungovernable temper that had kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Stearns almost an outcast for five years</seg><seg type="columnLine">flamed up in instant response to the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">temptuous laugh, which had started a series</seg><seg type="columnLine">of snickers. His wrath plus his drinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him totally unmindful of anything but</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting at the one who had given vent to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that amused, scornful laugh. Like a flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was off his horse and had started for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loud-voiced spectator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Drumm and three of the riders</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived on the scene Stearns was being held</seg><seg type="columnLine">by four men, still fighting wildly.

Ever since he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember the sullen rider's life had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a series of escapades, ranging from negligi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble scrapes to almost life-and-death im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">broglios, but this was the climax of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. The die was cast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE WAS perfectly cool and alert,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly, as he crowded the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the low cot and draped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanket down to hide it. He quickly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed the spent shot in the magazine clip,</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening closely the while. Apparently the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot had gone unnoticed in all the turmoil</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cheering spectators in the show proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">plus the manifold noises of the carnival.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Drumm's tent was on the opposite side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the show tent from that used by the carni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">val, and unless some one in the horse tent</seg><seg type="columnLine">had heard it his chances of a few hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">respite were good. Drumm was often hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find while the show was going on, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his absence would arouse no suspicion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Encouraged by the fact that no one had</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared, Stearns took time to hide the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body underneath a pile of saddles and blan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kets that were lying in one corner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent. First he pulled out a well-filled pock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">etbook from the dead man's pocket. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stole out, skirting the carnival at a safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance, and headed for the Southern Pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cific Railroad tracks, which ran past Dono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">van Field less than a mile away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From moment to moment he stopped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">listen, but there were no signs of pursuit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With luck it might be that he could reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">the border. The more he thought of it the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more he was encouraged to- hope that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be morning before the body was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">found. He had hidden it well beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">high-piled saddles and blankets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blackie Stearns possessed no idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">right and wrong--his creed had always been</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get away with as much as was safely</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible. He was as cool and nerveless as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if nothing had happened as he lay beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shelter of some bushes along the railroad</seg><seg type="columnLine">track. The black, ungovernable rage that</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed him at times had at last been his</seg><seg type="columnLine">undoing--and in some ways he was glad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For years he had drifted from job to job,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from fight to fight, because sooner or later</seg><seg type="columnLine">he alienated every one around him, wher-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever he was. He was hard, bitter, unre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pentant. If he should be able to get across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Rio Grande he would not greatly regret</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shooting of Bogie Bill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stearns knew the border, and he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he would do when he got there. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">he lay quietly and strained his eyes toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">San Antonio, looking for a headlight to</seg><seg type="columnLine">loom up northward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fortune favored him. A freight, slowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the Donovan Field crossing, passed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiding-place slowly enough for him to risk</seg><seg type="columnLine">boarding it. Running with the train, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to catch a ladder and swing</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard.

Searles knew more about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the extent of his chief's operations than</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other four men, and yet he was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly learning more and more of how</seg><seg type="columnLine">really far-reaching the strings were that</seg><seg type="columnLine">centered in Tia Nita.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With Manuel in Mexico City I reckon</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacDowell is hooked.

More than</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other single thing in all his years as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">underling of the man sitting beside him, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">name had shown him what kind of an or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ganization Fitzpatrick had under him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had known of Chinamen, bandit</seg><seg type="columnLine">chiefs, gunmen, judges, bankers and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least one mayor of a sizeable town who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">eating out of the hand of the man who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ostensibly the keeper of a general store; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew of one revolution in Mexico largely</seg><seg type="columnLine">promoted by that same merchant; but some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how the knowledge that one of his under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lings was serving in a position of trust and</seg><seg type="columnLine">power in the nation's capitol was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressive than all of Fitzpatrick's other</seg><seg type="columnLine">human and official machinery combined.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not ask for any details regarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the projected trip to Ausman, but smoked</seg><seg type="columnLine">tranquilly and waited. The velvet dusk</seg><seg type="columnLine">was commencing to soften the outlines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mesquite and veil the ugliness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough buildings, and the vanguard of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars shone palely, widely scattered across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkening sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fitzpatrick was silent, likewise. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the low hiss of the Rio Grande and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">noises of stirring night things marred the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stillness, when a low knock came to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears from within the store. Fitzpatrick's</seg><seg type="columnLine">living-quarters opened off the veranda on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they were sitting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The level voice was no louder than when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been talking to Searles, but the an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swer came promptly, in liquid Spanish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A man who wishes to see you, sehor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He will not say, setior.

Searles seemed to sink into</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper shadow against the wall. Fitz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patrick, as if carved from stone, was like-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise in shadow. Not even a hand had</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved since the start of his conversation</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Searles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment a young Mexican appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the corner of the building, guiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blackie Stearns. The Mexican stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few feet from the veranda and indicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to Stearns with a wave of his hand. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took up his station by the corner, out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">earshot. Two guns sagged from his belt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stearns walked slowly up to the porch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">striving to pierce the gloom that half-veiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dave Fitzpatrick?" he inquired, a touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of brSvado in his words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he stood in the light streaming from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doorway the marks of his journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed plainly on his rather gaudy cos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tume--red bandanna, blue flannel shirt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">much filigreed boots. He was dressed as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been for the show. His face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">haggard and dirty, but the broad shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">were held well back and his tall figure was</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was an appreciable interval before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fitzpatrick spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" he said finally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm here after a job," stated Stearns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hard, bold eyes on Fitzpatrick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rider got a curious impression that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light eyes of the man before him would</seg><seg type="columnLine">shine like a cat's at night--they seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Feud's End</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">35</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">be more obvious than any other detail of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fitzpatrick's appearance in the deepening</seg><seg type="columnLine">twilight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well?" said Fitzpatrick again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The icy inscrutability of the man to whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was talking began to affect Stearns with</seg><seg type="columnLine">much the same sort of half-hypnotism that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a snake exercises. Stearns knew his border,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through hard experience, and the knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of who Fitzpatrick was plus the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluence of his physical nearness sent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rider into a species of half-fearful nervous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. His next words were like the slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">hysterical bravado of a man who is defying</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knows not what.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "If you can't use me, I'll blow, but I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to know!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Fitzpatrick refused to be hurried. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was another interval, during which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">murderer of Bogie Bill stirred restlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "How long has it been since you had any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to eat?" asked Fitzpatrick suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his words as flat and emotionless as ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "This morning," returned Stearns, glanc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing surprizedly from Searles to his chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">and back again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell Jose to fix you up and bring you</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in half an hour."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stearns started to speak, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked himself with an effort. He turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a word and strode off toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexican, who was still lounging against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of the store, his cigaret glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">dully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Searles, did you notice that man?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Remind you of anybody?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Not especially."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you think that in the dark, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a uniform and a mask, he might make it</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard for anybody who hadn't seen him close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to swear that it was not MacDowell? Say</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Ausman?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Searles considered the matter leisurely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The two men were built alike--tall, rangy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad-shouldered. Their faces, while there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no resemblance, were of the same cast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although Stearns' was sullen and scowling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The little Texan finally nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I reckon maybe--in Ausman," he stated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the next half-hour Fitzpatrick did</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he would do, perhaps, with no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">man than Searles and for no other enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise than the one which meant the satisfy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of a twenty-year lust for vengeance--</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked over his plans with another man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">As quietly and casually as if httle depended</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it, although with a subtle undercurrent</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was deadly in its resolution, Fitz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patrick talked and Searles mostly listened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lined face showing no slightest indication</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he realized what the project might</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Stearns returned and Jose had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken up his former position at the comer</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fitzpatrick said--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stearns, I can--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tall rider jumped as if he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "--use you for a while.

His mind was in a whirl</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the realization that already Fitzpatrick</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew who he was. He was hooked more</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly at the start than he had expected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly the massive, sphinx-like bulk</seg><seg type="columnLine">looming vaguely from the huge arm chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">took on an additional sinister power to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerve-shaken criminal.

The re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">construction of a wrecked ship in the field is</seg><seg type="columnLine">always a long and tedious job, particularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">so in this case, because the ship had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">upside down in the mud for many hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Correll had put all his time on the motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as he had succeeded in getting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship right side up again.

There was little really tangi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble evidence, Tex reflected, and yet there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an indefinable atmosphere that set the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little village apart in his experience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> True, there were many men who showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the effects of liquor--more than usual in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a town so far from the border, but nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual for a man accustomed to towns</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying close to the Rio Grande.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't succeed in stealing the invention of</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacDowell and Sergeant Cary, at Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mullen, and now Fitzpatrick was seeing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it that he would get more years in jail than</seg><seg type="columnLine">that particular crime warranted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I may settle down in the U.

Daddy</seg><seg type="columnLine">George had once been desert rat, miner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowboy, in the days of his long vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth. Years before he had done a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">service to Searles in El Paso, and from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time on, at intervals, Searles had made it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">point to drift in occasionally, to the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's great delight. He would often recall</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the pathetic pride of an old man the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> time he had picked up Searles, almost shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">to death, in a dim side sÂ£r.eet of the "line"</seg><seg type="columnLine">in El Paso, and nursed him back to health</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the aid of Aunt Judy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder where Dave'll go when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">finishes gettin' this here flyer?" mused</seg><seg type="columnLine">Searles.

In fact, I shouldn't say there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">anybody that was, come to think, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderin' that Jamey Weston is her daddy</seg><seg type="columnLine">besides.

He remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered vividly the picture of the tall pilot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes flashing with the joy of combat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing at that poker table in El Paso</seg><seg type="columnLine">with drawn gun while his partner, Ransom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged in the money MacDowcll had won</seg><seg type="columnLine">by outwitting Beers and Aldez, the Mexican.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Searles himself had jus-t been inducted</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the game to make the fourth player; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other two were responsible, and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually enjoyed the scene. He had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">much of Roaring Bill MacDowell in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old days. His son was certainly not far</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thought I'd passed the diaper days, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">44</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">-if I'm stuck on tonight's job," reflected</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the outlaw. "It's - foolish, but I'm</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">plumb delighted that all I've got to do is</seg><seg type="columnLine">done, and don't amount to much, at that."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had changed the shells in Dad's gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it hung in the holster beside his bed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, while the old man slept. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were six blanks in, the long-barreled six-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooter now, and likewise in its twin, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old man kept hanging on the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">,TEX, Carruthers and Correll were</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their way home. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking tonight. Their young chauf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feur was busy elsewhere, for the first time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The past three days had been unevent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful--disappointingly so--but full of hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">work for the airmen. After getting the motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed and running it for a few moments to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make sure it was all right, they had spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">a solid half-day looking up a four-mule</seg><seg type="columnLine">team with which to drag the ship into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field where Tex and Carruthers had landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">theirs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came the tedious work of &lt;rerigging</seg><seg type="columnLine">the completely loosened fuselage and wings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An airplane fuselage is a series of cubes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">composed of four wooden longerons running</seg><seg type="columnLine">from nose to tail, with cross-braces every</seg><seg type="columnLine">few inches on top and bottom and struts</seg><seg type="columnLine">running up and down. Crossed drift and</seg><seg type="columnLine">anti-drift wires are stretched between each</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of corners of each cube.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To rerig the fuselage it was necessary to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the ship in flying-position by means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">propping up the tail until a level on the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">longeron showed the bubble standing ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">actly in the middle, and then start at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose and work back to the tail, pains-</seg><seg type="columnLine">takingly rigging each cube until it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely four-square. This was done by</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightening and loosening wires.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Should one of the sections be the least bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of line, all the following ones would</seg><seg type="columnLine">pyramid the error. In that case the warped</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuselage would result in loss of airspeed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would help throw the wings out of line.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many times the disgusted flyers fpund that</seg><seg type="columnLine">after carefully getting one panel lined, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lining of the next one would pull the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceding one out again. It had been tedious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">painfully accurate work with an insufficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">tool-kit, and now at the end of three days it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was done, although the wings still were un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigged. This, however, was not so difficult</seg><seg type="columnLine">a job.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Every day the two flyers had called on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Corinne after work was over, and for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last two evenings Carruthers had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">individual descents on the Weston domicile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corinne almost forgot her unhappiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the influence of MacDowell's humor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and - Carruthers' open devotion. She felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if she had allies now--and for two years</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had been alone, as far as the companion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship of youth was concerned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Little by little the two flyers, especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carruthers, heard from her lips the story</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the disintegration of James Weston. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not hint at what they conceived to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the real reason for his unexplained move</seg><seg type="columnLine">from El Paso to Ausman, and his change</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a happy, contented man to one moody,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous and irritable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Carruthers was made happy by the pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence of Corinne, but for Tex himself the</seg><seg type="columnLine">days had been disappointing. Not a ripple</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbed the placid current of existence in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ausman. Mr. Weston had habitually</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoided the flyers since the day when, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the excuse of showing MacDowell his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chickens, he had begged him again to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ausman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rSa-l THERE was but one incident that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ifjijmight be twisted to fit the theory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">i that Dave Fitzpatrick was the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the throne in Ausman. The incident</seg><seg type="columnLine">had happened the day before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was immediately after supper, and Tex</seg><seg type="columnLine">was walking past Balavo's place, by him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. The stout, bejeweled Mexican came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the door as Tex passed. The flyer looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him, a half-smile on his face. He ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected that Balavo would show some signs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rancor, judging from his actions at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">first meeting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, Balavo hurried out to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacDowell, shook hands effusively and</seg><seg type="columnLine">invited him to come in. Tex refused; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural course of action would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">to accept, even if he had known that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">putting himself in some danger, but in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ausman he was a man of one idea. Balavo</seg><seg type="columnLine">had almost cringed in his efforts to square</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself for what he had done out at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreck, and went out of his way to hint that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were no hard feelings on his part about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beating he had received, and that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be no attempt at retaliation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In MacDowell's mind there was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that perhaps Balavo had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">his master's voice--that orders had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to .avoid any friction with the stranger</seg><seg type="columnLine">Feud's End</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">45</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">until the big event took place. It did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem natural, some way, for Balavo to</seg><seg type="columnLine">change so completely from the vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrath and murderous desire for revenge</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had shown four days before. Tex knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexicans, and their outstanding trait was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a tendency to forgive an injury. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">addition, Balavo appeared to have both'</seg><seg type="columnLine">means and power, and was in a most ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellent position to make things hot for Tex</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Ausman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All these things were running through</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacDowell's mind as the three airmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked slowly down the main street and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned toward the hotel. The walk had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a silent one. All three were tired and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hardly feel like a trip up to Weston's,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked Tex as the three seated them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves on the edge of the veranda for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment before going in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You might as well. You know it means</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lot to Corinne to have somebody come in</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sort of break the monotony," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carruthers, fanning himself with an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">newspaper that had been thrown on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">veranda floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Smith, manager, owner, cook and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chambermaid of the hotel, came out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door with two letters in her hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some mail for you, Mr. MacDowell,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she announced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex looked curiously to see who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">writing him at Ausman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One was from his father, forwarded from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donovan Field.

Had he been the sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to whom girls make a special appeal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had the thought of doing so lovely a</seg><seg type="columnLine">one as Corinne Weston a favor smacked of</seg><seg type="columnLine">romance, he would have undoubtedly been</seg><seg type="columnLine">so pleasantly excited over the possibilities</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead that nothing else would matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As it was, the keen mind and hard com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon sense that were his heritage from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardy pioneer father began to get in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. He was living in the expectation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an opportunity to come to grips with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy he felt was entrenched in Ausman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and every person and incident within his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ken were examined suspiciously. Looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the note from that angle, somehow or</seg><seg type="columnLine">other it did not ring true.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he sat silently on the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">veranda, the two other men watching him</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiously, his mind was working with</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning-like speed, searching out the pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible bases for suspecting the note. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">instance, it would be natural for Corinne</seg><seg type="columnLine">to call on Carruthers if she really needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">aid of some kind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Why should she pick MacDowell in pref-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erence to Jack? Why should a mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">note be used, when she would have every</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity that afternoon to speak to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">personally, at least for long enough to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicate what she wanted? Why should so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much secretiveness be emphasized, when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be any suspicious circumstance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have him make an open call, as he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carruthers had been doing for several days?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jack, come over here a minute.

Tex had decided to obey</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prompting of the inner sense that</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned him. In the old days the Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dowell luck had been talked of throughout</seg><seg type="columnLine">Texas, when Roaring Bill was making win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nings at poker that opened the eyes of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">even in those days of high play, or cleaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way through obstacles that seemed insur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountable when rustlers and bad-men assist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed nature in making life a continual struggle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But back of that luck was the audacious</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit and fighting sense of the clan. Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dowell luck was responsible perhaps for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the providential warning that had come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex before his passage at arms with Fitz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patrick in El Paso, but it was the timber</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the man that had accounted for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming away with two thousand dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been bled from his enemy. Right</seg><seg type="columnLine">now he was staking much on his instinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was more to that note signed</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Corinne Weston" than appeared on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jack, listen to this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex read the note slowly, aloud.

I may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">too suspicious, but listen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One by one he gave his reasons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, on the other side, what would a</seg><seg type="columnLine">faked note do? It would keep me out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of everybody for two hours. If Fitz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patrick is at work and is trying to frame me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would very probably suit his convenience</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly to have me out of the way com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely for two hours. It may be to plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">something in my room at the hotel--almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">any crime could be fastened on me in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">town unless I had a bullet-proof alibi. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you think?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carruthers did not answer for a moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had forgotten the pain he had felt when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex had read the note--he was thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">now of the possibly approaching climax that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex had been looking forward to ever since</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had seen Beers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The more I think about it the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasonable it looks to me, old man," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally.

Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">here's my scheme.

It will be easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you to find out, I think.

It was not the careless, reckless joy</seg><seg type="columnLine">in struggle for its own sake, although that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a part of it. It was largely the fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction of a man who sees a chance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight his way out of a tight corner, pitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">his strength against his enemy's with a fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing chance to win.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, I'll be tickled to death to do it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex, and I'm started right now!" declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carruthers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He suited action to the words, and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted at a half-run for a short clean-up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hotel. Tex, his mind full of the many</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible ramifications of his situation, walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed slowly back to where Correll was still sit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting contentedly on the edge of the veranda.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sergeant, there's just a chance that</seg><seg type="columnLine">things are due to break tonight.

We're due back for supper right</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> now," said Tex as the three arose from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> their comfortable positions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The night-watchman went inside and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">secured his holster with the big, old-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fashioned gun in it, put on his huge, bat-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tered Stetson and joined them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The sight of the gun gave Tex an idea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somehow it seemed that unless all their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> carefully built up deductions were wrong,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> . there was something due to happen that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> night, and Weston's store was the logical</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> location for it, from every angle. He was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> certain that Daddy George was not in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> volved--the utter simplicity and sincere</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> kindliness that were visible in his looks and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> actions were not assumed, or else the old</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> man would have been the most wonderful</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> actor of the age. If Daddy George was to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> be a catspaw, and that man who had left</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> when they came in sight perhaps one of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fitzpatrick's men--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "We chased a visitor of yours away, I'm</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> afraid, when we came in sight," he said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> casually as they walked down the road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Oh, no, no," the old-timer assured him--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> somewhat nervously, Tex thought. "Just</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a friend of mine--he was goin' anyhow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   As a matter of fact Searles had left pre-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> cipitately with explicit instructions that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> under no circumstances was his name to be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> mentioned to the flyers. The old man was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> familiar enough with Searles to know that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> his visits to Ausman were always incon-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> spicuous, and it did not seem strange to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> him that Searles had enjoined the strictest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> secrecy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Tex walked along silently for a minute,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    4</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">while Carruthers kept the conversation</seg><seg type="columnLine">going. If Daddy George was a catspaw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps the plotters would see to it that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun was unloaded, to avoid taking any</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance. It would be an easy matter for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple of men to bind and gag the night-</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchman, without his getting a good look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at them, he reflected. It was worth in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestigating, anyhow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sort of interested in that gun of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours, sir," he said at length. "I'm more</seg><seg type="columnLine">or less of a nut on guns--brought up on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranch, you know. Mind if I look at it?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those big old-fashioned six-shooters aren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">as common as they used to be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You bet they ain't. I've had these guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">for thirty years or more--this here one's got</seg><seg type="columnLine">a twin back to the house."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He handed Tex the gun. The flyer</seg><seg type="columnLine">examined it casually.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mind if I take a shot at that old tin can</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, just to see how she shoots?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go ahead. Let's see what kind of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Texan you be," laughed Daddy George.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex cocked it and shot. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack, all right, but no signs of a bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitting the ground. No dust was visible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Must've been a blank," said the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prized Daddy George. "That's funny. Try</seg><seg type="columnLine">another one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Five more were tried--all blanks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By gorry, that's sure a funny circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance, ain't it?" queried Daddy George.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bet a cooky the manufacturer got some</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanks mixed in with the good shells. Mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">careless business, I'll say. S'pose some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body'd broke in the store some night, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">me blazin' away at 'em with blanks!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I were you I'd write the manufacturer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It might mean the difference between life</seg><seg type="columnLine">and death some time. I've seen one bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell in a lot, but never so many."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he returned the gun the flyer's mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">was racing. It was almost a sure thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">now--and he would be on the spot when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cap was blown off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, thanks for the company and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">information about the gun," said Daddy</seg><seg type="columnLine">George as they approached the store from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear. They had walked across lots</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the last part of the trip, to save time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll git me some shells in the store and load</seg><seg type="columnLine">up ag'in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good night, sir. See you again," chor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">used the flyers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jack, that cinches it cold as a herring,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">50</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex said as they walked toward the hotel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Those blanks were planted in Daddy</seg><seg type="columnLine">George's gun, of course. That means he</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't in it. They'll just put him out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, and they put in the blanks to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">things sure if he should happen to get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to shoot. He won't get the chance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm sure. They'll just wallop him with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of wood or something, or maybe bind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gag him in the dark store so he can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell who they are--or maybe just one man</seg><seg type="columnLine">will do the job."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If he should get a chance to shoot--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's an old-timer and there'll probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">be one dead crook," said Tex grimly. "We're</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to be right on the job around that</seg><seg type="columnLine">store, Jack--out of sight somewhere on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside. We can't work too fast--remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber it's possible we're all wrong. If we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, we've got to be careful to keep clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the frame-up. We'll be outside, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">them knowing it, ready to horn in at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right time. What say?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's the best way, all right. Poor old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daddy George is in for some excitement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I guess."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe, but we couldn't warn him. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">see how he worships Weston; he wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe it, and remember we're taking a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">for granted. However, he's in no danger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm sure Weston wouldn't have consented</seg><seg type="columnLine">to anything that would harm the old man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He'll just be carefully put out of the way."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Back at the hotel, Correll reported that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had had no luck in finding the boy--â– </seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would not be back from Acacia</seg><seg type="columnLine">until late. When the big non-com heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">what Tex had to tell he nodded, his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">alight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've got 'em, I do believe," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Go to it, lieutenant, and - help any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body that comes roving in the hotel to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DADDY GEORGE puttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">around in the shadows of the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">store, covering it slowly from end</seg><seg type="columnLine">to end. It was nearly nine o'clock, and only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light that came through the open door</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the office illumined the long stretch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor space and counters. The old watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man usually stayed in the office, but tonight</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Weston was working late, and so Daddy</seg><seg type="columnLine">George spent his time out in the store to</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoid bothering him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The old man was immersed in contented</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">musing. It was a source of great pride to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to feel that he was worthy of a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponsible position in his old age. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">served a good apprenticeship for taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">care of Jamey Weston's property, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought for the thousandth time. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">patted the long-barrelled, old-fashioned six-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooter, as he thought back to the days</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he had lived the life of the Southwest</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all the abandon of hearty, careless</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth. He had relcfeded his gun upon en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering the store.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man was dozing off on a pile of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blankets when the tall, masked figure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blackie Stearns slipped in the back door of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office. Mr. Weston, his face gaunt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">haggard started as nervously as if the visit</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not expected. Stearns had a drawn gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand, for effect. He was swathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a long coat, but puttees could be glimpsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Daddy George!" screamed Mr. Weston</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as Stearns took hold of him, and like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flash the old man awoke in time to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stearns throw the apparently lifeless body</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the storekeeper to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything was dim to the nearsighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">night-watchman, but he could make things</seg><seg type="columnLine">out vaguely as he started for the office,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pace slow, perforce, but his spirit â€¢</seg><seg type="columnLine">unafraid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stearns abstracted the thousand dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the safe during the few seconds which</seg><seg type="columnLine">it took Daddy George to get to the office</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. The night-watchman was glad of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunate chance through which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found out about the blanks, and reloaded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man, panting hard, got to the of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fice door as Stearns was apparently trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get out the door. The watchman, his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling, pulled the trigger. A searing</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron seemed to be pressed for an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">against Stearns' arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The murderer of Bogie Bill saw red. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain, the flash-like thought that darted</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his mind of a double-cross, the stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gering surprize of his wound, all contributed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the swift uprush of ungovernable rage</seg><seg type="columnLine">that made his sullen face terrible in its fury.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In an instant he had shot Daddy George</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man lay in the flickering lamp</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, the gushing blood staining the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his long white beard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Weston, who had been lying on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, as was his part, leaped to his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the last shot reverberated through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Feud's End</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">51</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">room. With a hysterical cry that was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">some wild beast's he leaped for his desk</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawer, where he kept his own gun. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">never reached it. Stearns dropped him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shot through the back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swiftly as it had come the murderous</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage was past, but once again the die was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast for Blackie Stearns. An explanation</seg><seg type="columnLine">would do no good--it was time to blow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflected Stearns with pounding heart but</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiously cool mind. He shuddered as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though with a chill as he thought of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold, massive chief upstairs. Like a shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">he slipped out the door, the thousand dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">still in his pocket. In one hand he clutched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air service insignia that had been filched</seg><seg type="columnLine">from MacDowell's room, and which Stearns</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been planning to drop in the store office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had no sooner left and faded into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows in the back than Tex MacDowell</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Carruthers burst into the office. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been hidden underneath the loading</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform. The pistol cracks had not sound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed loudly on the outside, and had come so</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast that the whole thing was over before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could reach the office. Stearns had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been a second too soon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   --! The watchman and Mr. Weston!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathed Carruthers, skrinking instinctively</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the horrible sight the office presented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex dropped quickly beside Mr. Weston.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The merchant's eyes opened and the twitch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing lips smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"What happened, Mr. Weston?" de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded Tex. "How badly are you hurt?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Through the back, and it's bad,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathed Mr. Weston. "Is--is Daddy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">George-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's dead, Mr. Weston," Carruthers</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him gently. "And I'm going for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor right now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He bolted out, leaving Tex to support</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gray head of the storekeeper in his arms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He staunched the flow of blood as best he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could with a handkerchief held tightly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are.you too weak to tell me what hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened?" asked Tex eagerly. "We-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door burst open and the fat form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vancouver B. Dale entered the office. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">the marshall took in the tableau his heavy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flushed face went gray and he shrank away</seg><seg type="columnLine">with stark fear and horror showing in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">lineament of his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"My--my-!" he whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The game is up, Van," Mr. Weston told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thin, lined face seemed more peace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful now, and the sunken eyes were not so</seg><seg type="columnLine">feverishly bright. As they rested on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of Daddy George there was an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they seemed to flash with bitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrath. The white-bearded old man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given his life to the patron who was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">unworthy of his devotion. Mr. Weston's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes sought MacDowell's face. Perhaps it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was yet possible to atone, somewhat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As soon as the doctor comes and gives</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a hypodermic or something, there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">many things I want to tell you, boy," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said gently, and the sunken eyes roved to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dale's pasty face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dale, who was literally paralyzed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unexpected trend of events, came to life</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a snap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no, Mr. Weston.

"Hadn't you bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter get out after Stearns, Dale? You</seg><seg type="columnLine">needn't be afraid--there'll be just two</seg><seg type="columnLine">names in the confession--Fitzpatrick's and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine. Oh, yes, and Stearns."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without a word Dale left. Tex held Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weston, stanching the wound as best he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could, his mind awhirl with the possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">consequences of that night. Evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been some hitch in arrangements,</seg><seg type="columnLine">resulting in the death of innocent old Daddy</seg><seg type="columnLine">George and probably of Mr. Weston. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound was very bad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sound of a motor was heard outside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in"a moment the doctor came hurrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. A glance at Daddy George told him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth, and it only took a short examination</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mr. Weston's wound to make him shake</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head sadly, his hard face softening a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trifle as he said simply--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About half an hour, Jim."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--I'm glad!" whispered Mr. Weston.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Can you give me strychnine or something</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I can talk a little louder?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">, The doctor nodded, and prepared a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypodermic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going to dictate something to you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant MacDowell, and sign it.

No one there saw Searles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he stood outside the window for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and watched the tableau, shadowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">eerily by the dim oil lamp.

It could last but a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">more seconds. Tex, his breath coming in</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasps, gathered himself for a last effort.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With his hands he exerted all the pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could against Fitzpatrick's body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not much, for his arms were bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly to his side by Fitzpatrick's grip.

The veins in his fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head stood out like welts, but inch by inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">he succeeded in bending his opponent with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, to the right. Finally both men fell;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fitzpatrick's grip loosened a trifle as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrist took most of the force of the fall. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flash Tex got loose and was on his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fitzpatrick was after him, his big form</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving with the speed of a panther. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">aimed a terrible blow at MacDowell--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">right swing. Tex used an old trick he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned in his college gymnasium. Quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a cat he bent from the waist, under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow. As he did so his left foot went for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward and with all the force of his body be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind it his right hand sunk in Fitzpatrick's</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed as if that blow should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished him. It did weaken him--for a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond or two he staggered. MacDowell's gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">clanged to the floor. It had hopped out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his belt as he bent downward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It bounced under the table, and Fitz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patrick was after it in an instant. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not quite quick enough. Even as his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">was closing on it MacDowell's foot caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wrist, and the gun went spinning to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fitzpatrick got to his feet, to be met with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a straight smash that knocked him down</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more. As he got up, he put one hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the back of a chair as if to help himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without warning he swung the chair^ so</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly that a leg grazed MacDowell's cheek</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he leaped back. It left a red line across</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side of his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fitzpatrick went off balance by the force</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his swing, and MacDowell rushed in with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vicious one-two with left and right that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent his opponent staggering to the wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">56</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was uncanny the way the man kept his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. He had scarcely touched MacDowell</seg><seg type="columnLine">except for the horrible moment when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded in getting his grip and bending</seg><seg type="columnLine">him backward, but the long-armed Tex had</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed a dozen blows on Fitzpatrick that</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried with them all the force of his superb</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, and yet the outlaw kept on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rushed again, and once more Tex suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded in landing a stomach blow. It weak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened Fitzpatrick perceptibly. For a half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute he fought weakly, weathering a</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm of blows to the face that left it crim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son with blood. And still, with terrible per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistence and endurance, he bored in, striving</seg><seg type="columnLine">to obtain a body grip once more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally Tex got his chance. He sent Fitz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patrick against the table with a blow under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ear, and for a moment the smuggler</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung there, the lamp swaying perilously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex put the last of his ebbing strength into</seg><seg type="columnLine">two more blows to the stomach, and Fitz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patrick sunk to the floor limply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The flyer staggered against the table, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath coming in great gasps. He steadied</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself for a moment, and then slowly got</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rope which he had dropped by the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tied Fitzpatrick's hands and feet. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrowed, opaque eyes were open, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great body was momentarily paralyzed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex used his handkerchief to wipe the blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his enemy's face. This done, he got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet and buttoned his O. D. shirt, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been ripped open in the melee. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked down at Fitzpatrick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a poor benighted heathen, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a first-class fighting man," he quoted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He picked up his Colt and went out. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was bound for the street to find -Vancouver</seg><seg type="columnLine">B. Dale. He wondered whether they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded in apprehending Stearns. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how or other he did not have much confi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence in the professional ability of the Aus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man sleuth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the stairs he saw the doctor. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentleman was standing on the bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform. Apparently he had been on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way for help to dispose of the bodies within,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had stopped to listen to the noise from</seg><seg type="columnLine">above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Had a little scrap," Tex told him as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The street was quiet and dark. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tiny, dirty Mexican restaurant showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a light in its windows. Inside there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least fifteen men, a few of them Mexicans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking excitedly. Evidently every one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was familiar with the principal events of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Further on, sounds of excited discussion</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached MacDowell's ears from within</seg><seg type="columnLine">Balavo's place. Tex, obeying a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">impulse, tried the doors in front. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened, and he walked in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were twenty or more men in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barroom. A couple of Mexican girls stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the doorway that led into the big room</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the rear. Vancouver B. Dale was among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men, all of whom appeared to have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinking. Silence fell suddenly as the tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">army man appeared, his thick brown hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">in crazy disorder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you get Stearns?" he demanded of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not yet. There's three posses out look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for him," stammered Dale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a-of a marshall," stated the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">flyer without heat, his hands stuck negli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently in his back pockets. "Come on out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">will you? I've got a little job for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was getting another posse in here,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dale said apologetically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The events of the evening had made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncertain of his position--extremely un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain. He followed Tex out like a lamb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got Dave Fitzpatrick roped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hog-tied, and I want him put in the lock-up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">â€¢do you understand?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were walking along the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the store.

"If you want to do as much for your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self as you can, you'd better do as I say."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shot went home. Without a word</seg><seg type="columnLine">they started once more for the store.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Tex!" came Carruthers' voice from</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jack came running down from the corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have they got Stearns?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No--the demon policeman here hasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleuthed him out yet," returned Tex.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Anything happened since I left?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Considerable," answered Tex.

Tex led the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way up-stairs, and into the room where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fitzpatrick, bound securely, was stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat on the floor. Dale was ludicrously ill</seg><seg type="columnLine">at ease. His eyes refused to meet the stony</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze of the man who had been the law and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prophets to him for years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex inspected the fussed officer of the law</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a grin on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Constabule, I'm not so darn confident,</seg><seg type="columnLine">someway, in the honesty of your intentions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In fact, I am frankly scared stiff that your</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural kindness of heart may hamper you</seg><seg type="columnLine">in your official duties.

What do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you think, Jack?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good idea," agreed Jack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now listen here!" blustered Dale, "you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">can't-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know we can't, but we're going to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sabe, brother?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dale's eyes fell before the level regard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tall flyer, whose purpose was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent beneath the gentle drawl.

The windows</seg><seg type="columnLine">were barred, and the interior contained two</seg><seg type="columnLine">cells, a hallway in front of them containing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a table and a chair. Each cell had a cot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">two blankets. Dale, after lighting a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">kerosene lamp, opened one cell. As soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barred door swung open he shrank</seg><seg type="columnLine">back against the wall, as if mortally afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get near the bound Fitzpatrick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The smuggler walked in slowly. Tex</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself loosened his hands, and clanged</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door shut. Fitzpatrick sat down on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed. His burly form assumed its wonted</seg><seg type="columnLine">position, hands resting motionless on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees. His eyes followed MacDowell con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinually. Carruthers watched him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious repulsion. He shivered at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiescent venom and menace that seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to compose the aura of Dave Fitzpatrick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the marshal had locked the cell door</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex held out his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mind giving me the key, Dale?" he in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I do!" stated Dale, stealing a quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">look at Fitzpatrick for approval.

Es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecially the high-and-mighty arrest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Weston's confession did not clear up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cloud that hung over him on the charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of carrying opium, but it helped a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal as a starting point to work from. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about a fifty-fifty chance that both</seg><seg type="columnLine">court martial and civilian jury would clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, now that Fitzpatrick was not in much</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a position to pull wires and keep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">anti-MacDowell pot boiling up around San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Antonio. If by any chance his father, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom he had dispatched a long wire the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night before, had unearthed anything down</seg><seg type="columnLine">at McMullen, chances for an acquittal that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would clear his name completely were ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wondered how long it would be before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the county sheriff arrived from Acacia.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unless he was badly mistaken, the sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have a Texas ranger to help him after</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacDowell senior arrived, which Tex was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure he would.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had walked out to make sure that the planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not been tampered with. At six o'clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evening train was due.

Smithers was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nasty in his attitude, but he was every inch</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">efficient. The town had been buzzing since</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his arrival, and undoubtedly many posses</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were scouring the surrounding country</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">right then for Steams. Word had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flashed far and wide already. Undoubtedly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">newspaper extras in San Antonio, Dallas,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Houston and El Paso were screaming the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">news of the double murder. If the informa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion regarding Dave Fitzpatrick had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">included, it would have been an honest-to-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">goodness sensation, reflected Tex.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ship he and Carruthers had flown</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in excellent shape, even to gas and oil.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The radiator had not been filled, but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still some water in it from the trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">down.

The hum of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand insects sounded drowsily in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears. He was forced to light a cigaret to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep the gnats from being bothersome--</seg><seg type="columnLine">had it not been for that he would probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">have dozed off into slumber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He strove to think of anything he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left undone--there was nothing but looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Mr. Weston's papers, and he wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his father there for that. He had wired</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacDowell, senior, not from any particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">need of him, but only because he was sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old man would be tickled to death to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the middle of things--and undoubtedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">would bring along with him a ranger or</seg><seg type="columnLine">some other representative of the law that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could take command and actually make</seg><seg type="columnLine">things move toward the finding of the mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derer of Daddy George and Mr. Weston.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had not known just how much the</seg><seg type="columnLine">county sheriff would amount to in so im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant a case.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His thoughts grew more vague, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted off into a blissful state of half-sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">and half-wakefulness that speedily grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">into sound sleep. How long he had slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not know, but he was awakened bv</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rude shaking.

His mind was casting</seg><seg type="columnLine">around eagerly. In all probability this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stearns--what was the best method Â©f</seg><seg type="columnLine">handling him, or trying to? A bluff about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship not working would probably be</seg><seg type="columnLine">effective, although risky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> T.he pilot tingled with the fierce elation</seg><seg type="columnLine">that filled him. For days he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">keenly watchful, playing a dangerous game</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all his might and with every realiza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of its importance. Now that was over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the deliberate playing for high stakes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at great risk, which was the MacDowell</seg><seg type="columnLine">habit, was the only thought he had now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Somehow or other he would gamble his all</seg><seg type="columnLine">against Stearns, on the chance of getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper hand of the man who was hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a gun on him now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't see yet how you're going to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">me carry you over the border," remarked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex as he finally slipped off the propeller</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover and started on the motor cover.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dark face grew darker.

He patted the gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaningly. "I guess it won't hurt me none</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have another man added to the score,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rather debonair, sullenly handsome</seg><seg type="columnLine">rider of a day before had disappeared--</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently Stearns had roved around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire night, because his face was cut and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratched, his clothing slightly torn, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes and face showed the effect of sleep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessness and nervous tension.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex hesitated for a moment--should he</seg><seg type="columnLine">take a chance on what he was going to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">next, for the sake of a plan that had leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his mind? In a flash he had made his</seg><seg type="columnLine">decision, and his words came casually as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">folded the engine cover.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After we get in the air, what are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to do?" he queried.

His plan for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">airplane ride, providing the man was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot, had leaped into his mind with heart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening possibilities. MacDowell's last words</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashed his hopes for a moment, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful temper that was the source of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">present predicament convulsed the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">face with all-consuming wrath. Tex was</seg><seg type="columnLine">never nearer death than he was for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space of a few seconds, while Stearns' finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">itched on the trigger of his gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some saving remnant of self control, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced by the thought that his only hope of</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape lay in the tall, careless pilot before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, kept Stearns from pulling the trigger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex had won his first point.

The stick had not been put</seg><seg type="columnLine">in since it was removed to carry Corinne.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can send us into the ground by</seg><seg type="columnLine">touching any one of them," Tex told him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, I guess we can start as soon as I pull</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blocks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned up the motor for a moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  5</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Temperature was only 65 Centigrade, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would do in a pinch. It ran smoothly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so he cut the throttle, crawled beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings and pulled the crude blocks Correll</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fashioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw a car turn into the side-road that</seg><seg type="columnLine">led to the field. Another one was rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the main pike. Far across the flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">fields, with the shacks dotting them at inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vals, a few tiny figures could be seen where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexicans were at work. It was quiet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">peaceful, lazily rural and summery. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun-barrel peeping at him from the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">cockpit was very close and very remindful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was going to be compelled to fly with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out helmet or goggles, as was Stearns.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, there were big isinglass wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shields on the sturdy Jenny, and the speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be so tremendous nor the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peller blast so powerful as in a D. H. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunching well down behind the windshield</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would not be hard to fly for the few mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments that would decide one of two things:</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether only.Blackie Stearns would lose, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether they both would. Not until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually got well off the ground would it</seg><seg type="columnLine">be certain that he would have an oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity to try his scheme.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not hurry as he lounged around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wing and climbed in. He was more de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberate than usual, in fact. Stearns, shak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing slightly but with no hint of weakness in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face, beckoned Tex with the gun as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'flyer started to throw his leg over the cowl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not by the slightest sign did Tex betray the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that it would have meant failure to all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his plans if Stearns had waited another two</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds to indicate to the pilot that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to say something.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you still want to have a pair o' eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fly south and don't stop and don't do nothin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">but get there!" Stearns said as Tex leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex nodded once more, his eyes resting</seg><seg type="columnLine">briefly on the unshaven, forbidding face so</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to his own. Then.he slid into the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">cockpit, buckled.his belt swiftly, and shoved</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the throttle without an instant's delay.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was atingle with reckless delight as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">sped across the ground and finally swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward. He had gambled heavily, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">far the game was a winning one for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He flew straight south, climbing as fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he dared. The westering sun was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the horizon--he must have slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">a couple of hours. It was very bumpy--</seg><seg type="columnLine">66</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">every time plowed land was beneath them</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship would rush upward, and the occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional damp places always flopped them</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthward from ten to twenty feet, as alter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nate currents of hot air, rushing upward, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold currents coming down, caught the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The motor was turning sixteen -hundred,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and getting hot. There was not a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal of water in the radiator, he knew. Oil</seg><seg type="columnLine">and air pressures were exactly right, though.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At a thousand feet he decided to take his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance. He looked back at Stearns, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was crouching down in his seat to save his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. MacDowell's own eyes were watery--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he put up a hand to shield them as he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. No thought of pity for the man be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind him undermined his determination.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had he been inclined that way, the tableau</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the office that was etched on his memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have decided him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He banked so gradually that Stearns did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not realize what he was doing until the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">had traveled a considerable distance back</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Ausman. MacDowell waited for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment when Stearns would look</seg><seg type="columnLine">around and see the waters of the Gulf</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretching to his right instead of the left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What would he do--which one of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">things? The next few seconds would de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termine whether Tex himself lived or died--</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the murderer of Daddy George and Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weston there was no hope in any event.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were twelve hundred feet high now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Tex, turned in his seat, nosed down</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually. He noted subconsciously that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the train was approaching the depot, three</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles away from where they were flying.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The glowing gray eyes watched Stearns like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hawk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rider looked up and his gaze met</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacDowell's steady regard. He guarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes with his hand as he straightened up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look over the side of the cockpit. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wires were screaming with the speed, as with</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor wide open the ship roared toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment the outlaw peered down</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily, then his eyes swept the Gulf--on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right instead of his left. The dark, for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bidding face contorted with fury, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big body lunged forward, a long arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched toward Tex.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pilot was bent forward as far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible. Stearns' arm did not reach within</seg><seg type="columnLine">a foot of him. The buckled belt held him</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight to the low seat--something that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landsman had not figured on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the supreme moment for Tex.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Would the raging Stearns use his gun in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat of his wrath, or "would he unbuckle his</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt to reach him? Stearns struggled wildly</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment, his eyes almost blinded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrific speed. Then Tex saw his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop. In a second Stearns lunged for him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the belt buckle unsnapped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a flash Tex jerked back on the stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">and jammed on left rudder. The ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">swooped up and over on its back in a fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">Immelman turn. The hand clutched at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a second, and was gone. Tex was low---</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than a thousand feet, but he pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward on the stick and neutralized his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rudder, holding the ship on its back for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment. Then he jerked back on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick and swooped downward and right side</seg><seg type="columnLine">up again, four hundred feet from the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The back cockpit was empty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XVII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CARRUTHERS, after a brief nap,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had spent the afternoon with Co-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rinne.

Corinne</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Jack had escaped from the depressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence of the silent house by taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long walk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As six o'clock approached Jack, who knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Tex half-expected his father on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">train, suggested to Corinne that they both</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to the depot. Tex would be there, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could all meet MacDowell senior. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had told her of MacDowell's idea that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have his father attend to straightening up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the business affairs of Mr. Weston, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad thankfully accepted. It would not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise for either of the flyers to do it--Tex by</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason of his conspicuous and unsavory</seg><seg type="columnLine">notoriety, and Carruthers for still other</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasons which he did not mention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the train whistled for the crossing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mile away Carruthers turned with a sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prized exclamation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That sounds like a ship!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is--see, there it is!"

Well, that was us for the next four or</seg><seg type="columnLine">five days.

The picture had</seg><seg type="columnLine">flickered off two reels of its lively footage</seg><seg type="columnLine">before Charley realized that the lithe figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the principal character was familiar. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">few moments more and old Charley was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stealing softly from the darkened interior</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Isis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His reason for leaving was simple. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had discovered that Victor Vyne, the movie</seg><seg type="columnLine">hero, was Vic Tipps. Victor Vyne, at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment enlivening the Isis screen in "Heart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beats and Saddle-Leather," was old Vic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tipps!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was then that Charley File determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take a vacation. His procedure was</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightforward. He simply went to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proprietor of the Palace Livery and an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced he was going away for two or three</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An hour later, aboard a train bound for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Los Angeles, he sat back in his seat con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentedly. So Vic Tipps had made himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">into one of these here movie actors! Charlie</seg><seg type="columnLine">mused. Well, if Vic was a movie star he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely have a lot of money. And if Vic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tipps had a lot of money--well, old Charley</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew how to get it away from him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That is, he could if Vic hadn't changed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anyway it was worth taking a little trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find out. For Charley needed money.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Old Charley File always needed money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> People had wondered, in Prescott, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had become of Vic Tipps. They'd known</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vic well ten years ago, and some of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lost a valued source of income when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vic left as he did--suddenly, on the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prescott staged her first cowboy contest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Same Old Vic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">83</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Prescott's first cowboy contest was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big affair. A purse of one thousand dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be divided among the bronco busters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was pretty good money ten years ago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Contestants entering the steer-roping, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulldogging and other events were equally</seg><seg type="columnLine">well provided for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Cowboys had saved for months to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured of sufficient entry-fee money. Vic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tipps was punching cows at forty a month</seg><seg type="columnLine">in those days, and he came into town the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day before the contest with one month's pay</seg><seg type="columnLine">and an overweening desire to enter in about</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty dollars' worth of events. That is, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">craved to take part in the bronco busting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same requiring a preliminary putting-</seg><seg type="columnLine">up of twenty cash dollars as an entry fee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Too, he was eager to compete in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roping of the steers, which meant the put-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting-up of another twenty. Then there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little matter of bulldogging; Vic was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully as anxious to display his skill and win</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reward in that line of endeavor--ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars entry fee!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vic thought he knew a way by which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could increase his forty to an amount that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would cover those entry fees and pay cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent expenses as well, and he had brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him certain ivory cubes with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">to accomplish that end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two hours after his arrival in Prescott</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had nine dollars left. He wooed fortune</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor at the Palace Livery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you fellas'd quit ropin' me inta your</seg><seg type="columnLine">crap games," Vic complained bitterly, "I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">have some chancet in this country."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was jist accidental." Charley File</seg><seg type="columnLine">was cheerfully wrapping his share of the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nings in a tobacco-sack. "Jist accidental."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why, even loaded dice won't roll right</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me," mourned Vic. "I'm gonna leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">this country some day an' go where nobody</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know me. I'm gonna cut out crap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shootin' an' quit losin' all my money.

"Things'll begin rollin' yer way</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty soon, Mebby you'll win it all back."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No more for me," declared Vic.

Now look at me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vic counted his money gloomily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nine dollars! Yah!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Squatting on his heels, Charley File</seg><seg type="columnLine">counted out nine silver dollars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shoot yuh all or any part of it," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated, flipping out a pair of yellowed dice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vic Tipps flopped to his knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shoot four bits," he snapped, grabbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Charley quit while Vic still had three</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars. But three dollars, even in the hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a genius, can't last. And Vic was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">genius; he must have been or he couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have borrowed a dollar and forty cents from</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Charley. But he got it, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked all day among his friends gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the contest and by night was reported</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have gleaned eight dollars and forty cents,</seg><seg type="columnLine">total.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Desperately in need of money for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance fees, Vic evolved a plan that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring him huge sums. It was so easy he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered that no one else had thought of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A carnival company was in Prescott that</seg><seg type="columnLine">week, replete with contrivances eager to</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply cash to whoever was in need. Vic</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply planned to win some of their money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gas flares lit up the busy wheels clicking</seg><seg type="columnLine">off "lucky numbers." Loud voices urged</seg><seg type="columnLine">one and all to buy a paddle and receive a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge cash reward. For fifty cents you</seg><seg type="columnLine">could win fifty dollars at the wheels. They'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">even pay you a dollar if you knocked three</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuffed tomcats off the perch at three balls</seg><seg type="columnLine">f'r a dime.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Roulette, roulette," bawled a human</seg><seg type="columnLine">fog-horn. "Real money you get. You win</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty dollars for fifty cents!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That sounded good to Vic Tipps. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried right up to the brightly lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">counter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gimme a paddle," and he laid down</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty cents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten numbers were on his paddle. Others</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded up and bought paddles until it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed some one was bound to win. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way the proprietor wanted it to seem.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But somehow the luckiest numbers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely reluctant to register. Vic won a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge box of candy, which upon being opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">84</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">proved to contain but a very few pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of very ancient candy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, there was that fifty dollars to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be given to the holder of the paddle bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that number--provided the wheel stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that number--and Vic tried it again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, once with four paddles, until it</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawned upon him that the possibility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one certain number showing up on a wheel</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing more than two hundred is not very</seg><seg type="columnLine">potent. Reluctantly he relinquished his</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddle to another eager to win the fifty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're shooting dice, boys."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A lovely lady cast bright glances at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing throng. Idly she cast four dice from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a leather cup.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Twenty-five dollars if you throw four</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixes or four fours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vic shied at this. Dice had been his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hobby--and his downfall. He knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty of producing the combination</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary to collect the twenty-five.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even as he thought, the beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady cast the dice from her cup. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green velvet four sixes stood in a row! Vic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tipps was astonished. He hadn't believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a thing possible. He paused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Try your luck, cowboy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lady held out the leather cup in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vitingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"A dime, ten cents. Won't make you</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor break you. Twenty-five dollars if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">get four sixes or fours. You win a prize</seg><seg type="columnLine">for every pair."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She indicated the collection of gold-wire</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shell jewelry decorating the back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides of her booth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vic Tipps stepped closer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Try it once, cowboy," urged the dulcet</seg><seg type="columnLine">tones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lady shook the cup and rolled out--</seg><seg type="columnLine">four fours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vic laid down his dime. He got a pair</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fives. For that he won a shell stick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pin. The pin was quite lovely in the bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of the flares, and Vic was thinking he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could sell it for [at least a quarter. But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed in his fingers as he pressed it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his neckerchief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still with his own eyes he had seen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady throw four sixes and then four fours.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He argued with himself that possibly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dice were fixed to fall that way once in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every so often so as to stimulate trade.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That sort of figuring cost him a dollar more;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for, with the desire to win the twenty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong within him, he made ten valiant at-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tempts to duplicate the lady's feat. He left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the booth with a half-dozen shell ornaments</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangling from his shirt bosom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt that if he'd just won that lucky</seg><seg type="columnLine">number on the wheel, or had the dice fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, he might even now be carrying fifty or</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred dollars. The thought cheered</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Having eaten nothing since noon, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped at a savory lunch-stand and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voured a sandwich and cup of coffee worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly fifteen cents--it cost forty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sloping table, baize covered, spread with</seg><seg type="columnLine">bills and coin next caught the attention of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vic Tipps. A rope held back the eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">players who, with rings at three for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter, were allowed to carry off whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could encircle with their rings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vic, hastily finishing his meager lunch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastened over. When he learned his throw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hand could almost touch the fortune</seg><seg type="columnLine">littered table nothing on earth could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped him from investing in three rings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He aimed at the twenty-dollar gold-piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">reposing in the center of the collection. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">slant of the table was deceptive, and two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his rings fell aimlessly. But the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">encircled a penny. This was an omen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">good fortune, and Vic took another quarter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth of rings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He still had four dollars left in his pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he gave it up. He was becoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaguely alarmed. It seemed his luck had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone back on him or something. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't easy money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here y'are, here y'are, here y'are!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">howled a voice. "Here y'are, here y'are,</seg><seg type="columnLine">here y'are!

Vic saw red.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Good thing Battling Lucas hadn't met him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in any such mood as this.

Vic's breath came</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster as he viewed the large denominations</seg><seg type="columnLine">represented therein. She selected three</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-dollar bills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here you are," she stated crisply as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed the three rumpled beauties to Vic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks," mumbled Vic dazedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thank you, ma'am!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nudging at his hat-brim with his fingers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned to go on his way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But--it was fifty dollars you lost? Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">it not?" she reminded him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yeah. Sure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vic halted and turned about a couple of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">times. "Yeah, fifty. Uh-h-h-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I gave you three twenties. That is</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixty.

I guess I c'n----"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly a thought occurred to Vic Tipps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He left the carnival grounds on high.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arriving at the Palace Livery he found old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charley File in charge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Charley, can you give me ten doll'rs on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my saddle?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Uh-hum," replied Charley. "Throw it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in the office here so's we c'n keep't locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Palace was always in need of good</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddles and stood ready to loan small</seg><seg type="columnLine">amounts at any time. So as Vic's saddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">took up its new abode in the security of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palace "office" ten dollars passed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charley File, Palace representative, to Vic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tipps, a gentleman seeking easy money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vic waited around almost ten minutes at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the carnival grounds before the young lady</seg><seg type="columnLine">again appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, you've come back!" she exclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if she'd thought he was gone for good.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then briskly--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here is the money."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She offered him the three twenties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks," breathed Vic, handing her his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten. "Much 'bliged."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are welcome." And she was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sixty dollars! Vic crumpled the soft notes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand and jammed his hand deep in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pants pocket. Sixty dollars! True, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been obliged to pawn his saddle for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten dollars change. But at that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty to the good, and fifty would enter him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the riding, the bulldogging and the roping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vic was elated. Already he heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaudits of the multitude as he would win</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the events on the morrow. That he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">secured the money by misrepresentation did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not trouble Vic whatever. Vic was care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">free in those days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made his way to the Palace hay-loft</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his bed. He did not sleep well that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night; he tossed about restlessly, eager for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the contest tomorrow. He felt now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then beneath his blankets to see if after all</seg><seg type="columnLine">it wasn't just a dream. But the folded bills</seg><seg type="columnLine">were always there. Wonderful good fortune</seg><seg type="columnLine">had befallen him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now and then some late stayer would</seg><seg type="columnLine">clump noisily up the narrow wooden stair;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then would come a rustling of hay and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratching on heavy canvas as the new-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comer unrolled his bed; followed by grunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">as tight boots were removed and the flare</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a match as with lighted cigaret the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turber retired. At each arrival Vic almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose and shouted of the benefaction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carnival management; but only the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that possibly he might be compelled some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to return that part of the money</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and above the four dollars he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually lost in the Lucas tent stayed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At sunrise he stole out and ate a hearty</seg><seg type="columnLine">Same Old Vic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">87</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast at a near-by lunch-room, offering</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the twenties in payment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, at the Elite ltinch-counter any bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">over two dollars was regarded with sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picion. Patrons of the Elite usually paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">in small change.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The proprietor accepted Vic's twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">gingerly. He took it to the front window</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bent over it solicitously. He shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head sadly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No good," he stated, languidly passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bill back to Vic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No good!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vic hooked his high boot-heels in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rungs and raised two feet off the stool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No good! Why--why, see them hairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it? 'Course it's good-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those hairs are just printed on it," en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightened the proprietor of the Elite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Printed on. Can't be!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vic peered anxiously at the bill. He even</seg><seg type="columnLine">tore a mite off the corner. One at a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">he unearthed the other two and subjected</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to. the same scrutiny. He rumpled</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and blew on them and bit at them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still the fact remained; in the light of day</seg><seg type="columnLine">close inspection revealed them counterfeit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vic was appalled. It made him sick at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stomach. He had given ten good dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get those three counterfeit twenties.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Despairingly he left the counter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I gotta go borrow sixty cents to pay you</seg><seg type="columnLine">with," he explained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He awoke Charley File and negotiated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"That's two bucks yuh owe me," old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charley reminded him. "Dollar forty I lent</seg><seg type="columnLine">yuh yist'day an' sixty now. Yuh owe the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palace ten on yer saddle, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Charley's head was a good ledger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vic actually went back and paid for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast; that shows how stunned he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the discovery that his twenties were</seg><seg type="columnLine">faithless. But within the hour he evolved a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan. He would wait until the big rush to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the contest events was on and he would go</seg><seg type="columnLine">in and enter, paying with his twenties, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">receive ten good dollars in change.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His plan proved feasible. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great rush of contestants to get their names</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at about the eleventh hour and Vic</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the midst of the jam. The registra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion official at contest headquarters was</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamped. Ropers, riders, cowboys of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorts, were in a hurry to get their names</seg><seg type="columnLine">down before the entry books were closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at noon. So it was an easy matter for Vic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to make his entries and pay for them with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three twenties to the official in charge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to whom large bills were accepted as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vic received a good ten in change. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he left the place. He left the crowds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped out to the contest grounds and hid</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the piles of baled hay stored there</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the feeding of the roping-cattle and wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses used in the events.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vic Tipps heard the grandstand filling</seg><seg type="columnLine">with spectators, but he did not look out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his hiding-place. He was uncom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortably aware that he had passed counter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feit money. Vic expected the sheriff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He crouched in hiding and heard the band</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it marched through the principal streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the head of the cowboy parade, but still</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not show his head. He heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whooping of the cowboys as they entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grounds and the applause of the specta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors as the standing Roman races swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the colorful arena in the opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectacle, but his ears were all attuned for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the voice of Sheriff David or the crunch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that worthy's heavy boot-heel approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bales of hay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not until he heard the voice of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arena director: "Bronc Riders ready.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bustin' contes' next," that he ventured</seg><seg type="columnLine">timidly from his nook. Expecting every</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment to feel the heavy hand of the law</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him, he furtively begged the loan of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle from an acquaintance and. when his</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn came mounted a tense-muscled black.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vic was beginning to hope that his law-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessness had not been discovered, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought he detected sly looks and whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">words among his friends. Possibly, he rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soned, it was imagination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just then his helpers released the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">demon upon which he was seated. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">black wheeled clean about, squealing, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went off in a series of crooked, arching</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumps. Vic was usually a pretty good rider,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that day he felt himself getting a trifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind. He could ride to the top of each</seg><seg type="columnLine">leap without difficulty but in the coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">down he found himself arriving there just</seg><seg type="columnLine">a split second after the horse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the horse shot back up he met Vic</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming down. That little collision resulted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Vic's going just a bit higher on the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suing rise than was his wont and the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he came down the bobbing saddle met</seg><seg type="columnLine">him half-way. There followed an impact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that could be heard to the nethermost parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">88</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of that grandstand. Then as Vic's spurs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clicked together above the saddle-horn there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was a roar from the spectators through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which not even the discharge of a French</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seventy-five could be heard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Vic hit the dust so far away from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">black that it seemed incredible he had ever</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been on the beast at all. Amid the glee of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the crowd he scurried around behind the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">corrals and thence to his hiding-place among</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the bales.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Well, he hadn't been arrested. That was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">some relief, he thought. Most likely they'd</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">never learn who passed the counterfeit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">twenties. Vic even went so far as to peek</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over the bales and see some of the other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">boys ride the broncs. And by the time they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">got around to the trick and fancy roping</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he was up, seated atop the rick, enjoying</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the show to the fullest extent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Next event, the bulldogging!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The announcer's cry came almost wel-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">come to Vic Tipps. With high hopes he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mounted a borrowed horse and took his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">place. One by one he saw others ride out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and grapple their steers with naked hands</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and throw them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then all at once he saw Sheriff David.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He was conversing with a short stranger</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">- and seemed to be looking straight at Vic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But the sheriff was cock-eyed and Vic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">couldn't be sure. At least he appeared to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be looking at Vic, and it was as the cold</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hand of death to Vic Tipps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Finally his name was called. His blood was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> chilled with vague foreboding as he rode out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The corral gate crashed open and a huge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">red steer galloped forth speeded by two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whooping hazers. The starter's flag dropped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and Vic mechanically clapped the spur to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his eager little cow-pony. Swiftly he bore</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down upon the plunging steer. As his pony</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">swept close he leaned out from the saddle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and caught at the bobbing white horns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Even as he did so he realized all was not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">well. Now in his hands, wet as they were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with the perspiration of a guilty conscience,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the horns were like two wriggling trout.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was too late to draw back, already he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out of the saddle and the pony was whipping</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on past. Vic clung there a moment, clawing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the steer's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Like a tramp missing his hold on a box-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">car he slipped down along the steer's side</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and went sprawling onto the hard earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He heard but dimly the swelling roar of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">laughter from the grandstand as he rolled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">over and over. Then, staggering to his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">he, like the steer, galloped for the shelter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the baled hay in the feed-lot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Vic did not stop at the hay. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even pause. Fear and humiliation sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard upon him. In his mind's eye he still</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a clear picture of Sheriff David's weird</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes peering at him over the shoulder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the short stranger. He knew they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">after him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Giving no thought to his entry in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coveted steer-roping, he hurried onward to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fence. There he vaulted and loped as</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly to the railroad yards, as high-heeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">boots would permit. He had said he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometime go elsewhere, and he felt that now</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the appointed time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And ten years later old Charley File saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Victor Vyne, movie-hero in "Heartbeats and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saddle-Leather," and recognized in him Vic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tipps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OLD CHARLEY had been in Cali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fornia a week before the goings-on</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased to bewilder him. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting accustomed to seeing painted humans</seg><seg type="columnLine">in odd attire, dancing-frocks and evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes, scurrying about at midday. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ceased to peer if a troop of mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowboys, following a motor truck, passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his door at sunrise. Or to wonder at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">group shooting pictures in the blaze of elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tric light at midnight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What he had at first supposed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendid hotels proved to be merely res-</seg><seg type="columnLine">idences of these same movie actors. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of these palatial homes old Charley</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed long and earnestly at the camel in</seg><seg type="columnLine">gay trappings that dozed, hitched to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pillars of the front porch. At an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other a beautiful girl, four monkeys and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who looked like a monkey, munched</seg><seg type="columnLine">candies on the rose-fragrant lawn. Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charley saw a great automobile with three</seg><seg type="columnLine">seats roll up to the curbing. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">flunkies in the front seat sat stiffly rigid</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the two flunkies in the rear sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the doors to release the two passengers--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a girl who reminded Charley of a perky</seg><seg type="columnLine">little squirrel and a dapper male companion</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose face reminded Charley of a wizened</seg><seg type="columnLine">walnut-hull. They minced loftily across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">few feet that separated the car from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">awninged entrance to their palace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The homes were growing more imposing</seg><seg type="columnLine">as old Charley File hobbled along, his high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heeled boots thudding strangely on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Same Old Vic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">89</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">palm-shaded cement walks.

She had taken refuge in a second</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clump of alders, and Wentsel was trying</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to force his horse into these. The animal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To my amazement he found me a hiding-place</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the attic of the old mansion. As I sat there in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark going over events in my mind and figuring</seg><seg type="columnLine">out my chances of reaching King's Bridge and es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caping into Westchester, two fatigued strangers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were brought mysteriously into the room by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Socrates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We could not see each other and we did not dare</seg><seg type="columnLine">converse--since English officers had taken their</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters in the house for the night--until it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost daylight, when we made our way out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open. As we came into the clear road, the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaks of day were lighting our way. I turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look at my companions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The older was Paul Bowen, the man I had met</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I first came into Manhattan. That was sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prize enough; but when I looked more intently at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other, I was staggered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Betsy Osmond!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Betsy Osmond, also a patriot and a spy! To my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own peril was now added the peril that hung over</seg><seg type="columnLine">this brave but exhausted woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was high-strung and balked each time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was spurred forward. Just as I was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehending what had happened Wentsel</seg><seg type="columnLine">howled an oath and hurled his long pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the slender figure crouching low behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sapling growth. Then the infuriated</seg><seg type="columnLine">man sent his horse crashing sidewise into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thicket for a few feet and leaning from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saddle attempted to slash the terrified</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl with his sword.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shouted for him to stop his devilish</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. He swung his horse about and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing me grimaced like a fiend and jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mount toward me. Off in the west men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were shouting, and I knew it would not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">long before he had reenforcements. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tore down upon me and slashed at my neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">I ducked and gained the edge of the maid's</seg><seg type="columnLine">refuge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To those not yet in sight he yelled:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on! I've got the whole nest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tried to get the girl's attention, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrate her understanding, in an effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have her run for it while I kept Wentsel</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy. But she was so intent on staring at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the form of Bowen I doubt if she realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">my presence. Then I had to shift my posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion as the colonel swept around the thicket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second holster pistol raised high in place</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sword. I dived behind some berry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushes and remembered that I, too, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistols. When I came to my feet he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost upon me, his horse rearing high, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">patches of foam flying from his mouth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The colonel fired and I let drive with a High-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land pistol. He struck the ground almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as his rearing charger's hoofs</seg><seg type="columnLine">The White Dawn</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">93</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">smacked down. I seized the bridle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought for a moment to bring the brute</seg><seg type="columnLine">under control.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Betsy Osmond! Oh, Betsy Osmond!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Come! Come!" I cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even after she had stared at me for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment she could not seem to understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">how the brutal colonel could disappear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morgan, the sergeant, be standing in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come!" I called again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Bowen?" she panted as she crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the thicket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dead, I think. Soldiers are coming."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She trembled violently and sobbed--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The brute shot him down without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word. Shot him from behind!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know! I know!" I said, tossing her</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the horse. "Hold this beast for a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond. I ran to Bowen and searched his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing and secured a thick package of</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers and thrust them inside my coat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I ran to Wentsel and secured the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol still clutched in his right hand. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet had caught him in the middle of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead. The cries of the men, trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">locate us, now sounded louder. Leaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">onto the horse I threw an arm around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl's slim waist and struck out for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">highway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The cloak!" she exclaimed, tilting her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head to look at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She referred to the colonel's military</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloak which he had thrown back. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting on it. As I worked it out from under</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and got it over my shoulders I noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was wet with dew, and I knew he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been hunting us throughout the night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now I wished I had had time to secure his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat and boots. Still in the early morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most conspicuous point in our appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance as we dashed into the road was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long cloak. In noticing that, one would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first observe the lack of boots and proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">headgear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I praised Betsy Osmond for thinking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it even as I was bringing the voluminous</seg><seg type="columnLine">folds about her. At a distance we must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have resembled a portly Hessian officer bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">on serious business. As we clattered along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the highway' I saw two groups of soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">running from the north and making toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shack. These would be some of the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">detailed to hold the line from the road to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Jones farm. These must have included</seg><seg type="columnLine">all men posted on the road itself, for we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not hailed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can we ride right through?" asked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only good for part of the way," I an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered. The next moment we were passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the branch road leading to the Harlem</seg><seg type="columnLine">river and three soldiers were springing from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bushes. They recognized the dragoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse and noted the military cloak before</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could get at my second pistol, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinctively slunk back. Before they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">gather their wits we were by them. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not venture to fire until we were nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of range, and then their shots came</seg><seg type="columnLine">some seconds apart, as if they doubted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisdom of their action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They'll be after us on the road soon,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I told her. "We must quit the horse and</seg><seg type="columnLine">take to whatever cover we can find and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait till night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do as you think best," she listlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied. "I am useless. I have disgraced</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are wonderful! At the next bend</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will dismount."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ahead was the spire of a church, marking</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little village. We were nearing a region</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fields, dotted with homes of Dutch</seg><seg type="columnLine">farmers. I pulled the horse down to a walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leaped off. The girl slid to the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We were very open to discovery and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage began to weaken. From the saddle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bag I procured a stock of powder and some</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullets for the long pistol, also a flask of</seg><seg type="columnLine">brandy. The road was empty in both</seg><seg type="columnLine">directions, and the shade-trees scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the borders shielded us somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the gaze of any one abroad in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fields. But once we were sighted it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a poor place in which to seek cover. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">maid studied my face and must have read</seg><seg type="columnLine">despair there, for she pointed to a thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand of maples at one side, the foliage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was unusually thick. "They'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for us far from the road once they</seg><seg type="columnLine">find the horse," she said. "They'll search</seg><seg type="columnLine">every farm. Let's get up into the trees."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was audacious, and therefore worthy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">consideration. Had there been a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to double back I gladly would have taken it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a moment's thought I agreed. "Back</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the horse. I'll lead him under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches to save you from barking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trunk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon she was snugly perched in a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">maple with the military cloak folded for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cushion. I led the horse back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of the road and sent him galloping</seg><seg type="columnLine">94</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> on down the highway. Pausing only to</seg><seg type="columnLine">obliterate the hoof marks near the tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shinned up into the heart of the foliage</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made a careful selection of a crotched</seg><seg type="columnLine">limb and arranged my belt for a back-rest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We had no food, and what was worse, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wishing in the world wouldn't turn the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle of brandy into water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My first task was to reload Wentsel's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol and my own brace. I had barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished doing this when Betsy clutched my</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrist. A dozen mounted men were thun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering up the road intent on following the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks of the dragoon horse. Foot-soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">would soon be streaming after them. I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">them coming and after they had passed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had proceeded a bit up the road; but when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were beneath us they were invisible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were some of the light horse and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of Wentsel's command.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After an hour elapsed we learned that</seg><seg type="columnLine">roosting in a tree is most irksome. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">constant fear that some careless movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">might agitate the foliage and advertise our</seg><seg type="columnLine">position, and the physical discomfort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintaining the same posture became un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">endurable. To remain there until night-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall was utterly out of the question. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">much time to study Betsy Osmond, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her wan face aroused my deepest pity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pathos of her drooping mouth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy's clothes made her appear to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">very young and helpless, no taller than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a twelve-year-old lad. When she spoke it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in a tremulous whisper. I told her we</seg><seg type="columnLine">must change our plans and risk descending.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She rewarded my decision with a warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile, but before I could swing down from</seg><seg type="columnLine">my perch we were startled by the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bell. Around the bend at the south</seg><seg type="columnLine">straggled a cow. Behind her came others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen in all. These were driven by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rustic, fully as disreputable in appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I. The cattle were inclined to stray from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road and the cowherd's progress was</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow. Before the herd reached our tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">a company of light infantry came up be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind it, marching briskly. The coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the soldiers sent the cattle into the fields.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The officer questioned the rustic and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">informed that the cattle were being driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few miles beyond King's Bridge, whereat</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ordered his men to drive them back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road. This thoughtfulness was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">prompted solely by a desire to accommodate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cowherd, for once the cows were re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned the officer wrote on a piece of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> paper and handed it to the rustic, saying:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Give this message to any mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer you meet. Don't let your cattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">stray and take you away from the road."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rustic put the paper in his hat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised to deliver it at the first oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity. The soldiers were split into two</seg><seg type="columnLine">bands, one for each side of the road, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered to search the countryside closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to a considerable distance, the officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">going with the detachment assigned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">east side of the road. During this business</seg><seg type="columnLine">the maid had trembled until I feared she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would betray us. I scarcely dared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathe until the last red coat had quit</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road and the officer was hurrying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the eastern end of his line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cowherd lost all ambition for haste</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seated himself in the shade and at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted to read the message. The scrap</seg><seg type="columnLine">of paper became of vast importance to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw in it a passport, a safe-conduct; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">being directly over the fellow I dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">down upon him, flattening him to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. The girl gave a little cry, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I called for her to be calm. I remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I had landed--on top of the cowherd</seg><seg type="columnLine">--until satisfied my mishap had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed from the fields. Then I got hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fellow's throat and drew him to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. There was no necessity for choking</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, as he was unconscious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      I CALLED to the girl to come down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bring the cloak and belt. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">strips torn from the cloak I secured</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fellow's hands and feet, and with a stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more of the cloak improvised a gag.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By the time he opened his eyes he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">snugly tucked from view behind a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">clump of bushes some distance from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you kill him?" asked the girl as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I returned to the tree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I	quieted her fears and recovered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">note from the dust and opened it. It read:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">To any of His Majesty's mounted officers:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lieutenant Hopgood, 1st Infantry, reports the</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder of Colonel Wentsel, heavy dragoons, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped spy. Lieutenant Hopgood has men on</seg><seg type="columnLine">each side of the King's Road, working north and</seg><seg type="columnLine">raking the fields and farms. (Signed) Hopgood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cutting her a stick I picked up the cow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">herd's staff, and the two of us soon had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove moving up the road at a far better</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace than my victim had ever achieved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The White Dawn</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">95</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The exhilaration of being afoot, of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">free to move, gave me high spirits. Mistress</seg><seg type="columnLine">Osmond's small face took on a new expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. With a sidelong glance she said--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You are quite resourceful for a ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geant."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are very brave for a lady's maid,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I rejoined. "If we meet any soldiers chase</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a cow, keep in motion, don't let your</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat fall off. And you'd better rub some</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirt on that pretty face of yours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She did so and also rubbed dirt on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">backs of her small hands and on her wrists,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but she refused to soil her slim throat, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed soft and white above the .coarse</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt. In such punctilios will the feminine</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind indulge. To remedy the incongruous</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect I had her tie her handkerchief snugly</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her neck, albeit the day was over</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm. For half a mile the cattle moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">smartly, and then slowed up to a graze.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A strong breeze came from the north, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessened the heat none. It brought black</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds and the rumble of thunder. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">maid walked close bv my side and said--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It will be a thunderstorm."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The best thing we could ask for. Better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than night," I rejoiced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't like the lightning," she confessed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A quaint contradiction. She dared every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in running the British lines, trusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her nimble heels to escape from old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mother Baff's band, and was afraid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thunderstorm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sorry I tried to shoot you at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Betworth house," she suddenly said. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not myself. I am very sorry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Please don't remember it. You did</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A blinding flash and a terrific explosion</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent the cattle to crowding against each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. The maid pressed against my side</seg><seg type="columnLine">and faltered--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That struck near here!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rain began falling as if the bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been torn from some celestial lake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Puffs of dust rose under the bombardment</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a bit, then the road became a lagoon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fields steamed and objects were blurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a short distance. I passed my arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the maid to support her. We bowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the cloudburst and almost before</seg><seg type="columnLine">we knew it mounted men were splashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the leaden wall ahead. An officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost rode us down and bellowed--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep your cattle out of the way!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I produced the message and handed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to him. He had his cloak over his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as my Oneida friend, the Tree-Breaker,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wears his blanket when the weather is</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough, and I glimpsed a hawklike face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray mustaches as he bent over the writing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To the muffled figures back of him he</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "--'s mercy! Colonel Wentsel has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">murdered by that cursed spy! Hopgood</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the light infantry writes this.

Good thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Too soft to take our horses into the fields.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forward!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His stirrup hit me in the chest and sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to one side as a courteous reminder to</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear the way. They splashed by at a trot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each muffled pyramid of a man blind to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their great chance. We drove our cattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the little village during the down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pour and saw no one abroad. By the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the storm cleared we had driven our cattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the King's Bridge. Less than a year</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I had passed that way and had wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nessed the destruction of the small wooden</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure by the retreating American army.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leaving the maid to herd the cows I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the spacious two-story tavern near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Old Wading Place, kept by John Cock, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the kitchen door bought some bread</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cheese and a jug of fresh-drawn beer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were off the island and within seven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen miles of White Plains, and about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same distance from Tarrytown. The road</seg><seg type="columnLine">through Wepperham was the most direct,</seg><seg type="columnLine">96</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">allowing us to keep close to the river and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross at Dobb's Ferry if fortune favored us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or at Tarrytown above. Betsy was fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">delighted and I had to caution her, or she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have burst into singing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The storm was rushing out to sea and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island.was drawing away from us, and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart was high in knowing so much of</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger had been avoided or overcome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's you I have to thank," she earnestly</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "And to think how I talked to you at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the farmhouse, and how you refused the</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey-cake through pride. I was glad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other man came back and took it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That would be Bucks," I murmured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, still driving our weary cattle, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">far($d north while across the river General</seg><seg type="columnLine">Washington's army waited at Ramapo to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see which way Howe's army would jump;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we had the news which would set our</seg><seg type="columnLine">army in motion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ARMY FALLS BACK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE REACHED Ramapo without seri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous difficulties, and the maid vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find her mistress and procure suitable at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire. I presented myself at headquarters</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to learn that Bucks already had ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rived with the news of Howe's sailing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was not necessary for General Wash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ington to question me in person. I handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over poor Bowen's papers to an aide. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation with this officer I learned that</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiety over Howe's plans had lost some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its edge, being dulled by worry over Bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">goyne's advance upon Ticonderoga with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a magnificently equipped and superbly offi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cered army.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burgoyne had won renown in Portugal</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all his staff and regimental officers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinguished by their professional attain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments. Even St. Luc de La Corne, in com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand of the Indian host, was the best of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind and had no superior in audacity and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferocity. In truth, I heard more about this</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhuman character than I did of the experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enced Riedesel, the knightly Fraser, bold</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord Balcarras, the distinguished Phillips,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or any of the other eminent officers with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burgoyne. Nor is this strange, for men</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk of that which they hold in detestation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or fear. Burgoyne's officers were uniformly</seg><seg type="columnLine">most courteous gentlemen; the partisan In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dian leader was close kin to the devil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was early morning when we arrived at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ramapo and my business at headquarters</seg><seg type="columnLine">was soon done. I wandered about the camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the village and found soldiers and civ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ilians gabbing wild stories, some of them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the effect that stout Ticonderoga had fallen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was nothing to warrant these rumors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I would have dismissed them as camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">gossip if not for my friend, the aide, hunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">me up shortly after the noon hour with or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders for me to travel at post speed to Fort</seg><seg type="columnLine">Edward, General Schuyler's headquarters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn the truth about conditions in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was to select a man to act as my mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">senger.

At once I set about hunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for Bucks and, instead, encountered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Audrey Betworth on the outskirts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the village. She was walking with her maid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If possible she was more beautiful than ever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had Parthenope possessed such charms no</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ulysses could have passed her by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I came to a halt and bared my head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood like a yokel, hoping to hear her voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She looked at me as though I were some</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange kind of a bug, her gaze taking me in</seg><seg type="columnLine">in passing.

Thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes thereafter we were mounted on ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellent animals, armed with Deckhard rifles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and riding north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we rode through the war-weary coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trysides Bucks told me his adventures. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">short, he had managed to reach King's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bridge ahead of the alarm and had had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble in crossing the river and making</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ramapo. But it was not until we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached Albany that we had talked our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves out, for he needs must hear my story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We began observing conditions and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mood of the people. Tryon county, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast region containing all the settlements</seg><seg type="columnLine">west and southwest of Schenectady, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">boiling with terror. We did not need to as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cend the Mohawk to learn that much. Men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and women pouring into Albany supplied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the information. From their testimony it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was plain that the settlers along the Mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hawk were eager for the strongest alliance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">be it American or British; this because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their outlying position and their exposure to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian raids.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even the friendly Oneidas, now camped</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to Schenectady, were uneasy; for they</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the Mohawks, Keepers of the Eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">Door, were coming under Joseph Brant</seg><seg type="columnLine">along with Barry St. Leger's army and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would be a bloody reckoning. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oriskany, German Flats, Palatine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schoharie the committees of safety were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sending frantic messages to General Schuy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ler, all bespeaking pessimism.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The spirit of the people was pusillani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous, charged one report; persons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">98</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">influence were betraying America, accused an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. Both regulars and militia in the val-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley seemed to be almost paralyzed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear; or at least they were not displaying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">qualities expected from soldiers and citizens.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These conditions were the more disturbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">because they had not been expected; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tryon county early in the war had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lead in emphasizing loyalty to the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">republic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bucks viewed all this as being more seri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous in the telling than in the fact. Stripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his idioms he believed that just before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrival of any test of strength there are cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain phases of nervousness to be gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">through with. He confidently held that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">average man steadies down to his work and</seg><seg type="columnLine">does it well once he finds the crisis upon him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After they've been well blooded they'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">do fine," he insisted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I soon discovered another trend of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought which disturbed me keenly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">which could not be explained away, or miti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gated by the rifleman's philosophy. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a growing hostility toward General</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schuyler. The command of the Northern</seg><seg type="columnLine">department had from the beginning been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">political prize, with Congress stupidly shift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing generals as fast as an aspirant could de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velop more political strength than was pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessed by the incumbent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In Schuyler's case I traced his ill fortune</seg><seg type="columnLine">to New England's prejudice against New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York; and the cause could be sought far</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in colonial days, being expecially no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticeable during the French war.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I drew up my impressions in the form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a letter and went to the flats above the town</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find a soldier to be detailed as my mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">senger. The intelligence was not of suffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient importance to be despatched by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bucks; nor did the rifleman have any in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clination to ride south. While we were jog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging through the outskirts of the town we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were compelled to slow down by a group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited citizens blocking the road. As we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were skirting these a man wildly yelled:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good-! They've took Ticonderoga!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I REACHED down and caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow by the scruff of the neck and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook him soundly, and warned:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No more of that, or we'll give you a taste</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lash.

Defiance)</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mount Hope unoccupied. It was from</seg><seg type="columnLine">these two positions, and especially from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sugar Loaf that the British had raked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gates was originally appointed to com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand at Ticonderoga, but his jealousy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schuyler caused him to refuse, thus delaying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the work of putting the fort in a proper state</seg><seg type="columnLine">of defense. But all this was for me to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">on some tomorrow. I knew the news was</seg><seg type="columnLine">true, and I leaned against my horse, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart and head both low as I traced the ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vance of the evil tidings up the hill and</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the town. God knows we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared the worst when we learned of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three-fold movement,,of Burgoyne, St. Leger</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Howe. Even with Howe out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">campaign there was but one chance of pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venting Burgoyne from reaching Albany,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that was to cut his line of supplies before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reached the hill town and could levy</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the New Hampshire Grams and the,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mohawk valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My brother makes a new war medi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cine?" courteously asked the Tree Breaker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I jerked up my head and endeavored to</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile, ashamed to show emotion before one</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was bound to construe it as an unmanly</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My medicine is strong.

He had found the kettle in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted house and had butchered a steer</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the road. We camped long enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to boil some of the beef, which was tough</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unsavory for the lack of salt. Tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">Breaker did not care for salt and ate heart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily. While we were eating there was a rush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of feet through the bushes, and the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses which I had. hobbled, made much</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise.

And it was a curious fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">whenever we succeeded in questioning any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these fugitives we were none the better off</seg><seg type="columnLine">as for news. They were filled with frenzied</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, and drew the most absurd pictures of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the calamity.

But a light burned in a church</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the left. I left the Oneida with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses before this building while I advanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to investigate. Although the night was</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm the door of the church was closed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I threw it open and beheld a dozen men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">women.

He did not seem to know they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were there, and-his haughtiness held them</seg><seg type="columnLine">back from any demonstration beyond mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered threats and epithets. He was relieved</seg><seg type="columnLine">by my appearance, however, and was eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be off. We struck into the old military</seg><seg type="columnLine">road used by Abercrombie and Amherst in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the French war, and followed it for a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was the road open to Burgoyne had</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had the wit to use it instead of attempt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to bring his army through a virgin wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derness, where nature's obstacles were aug-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mented by the American backwoodsmen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was to use up twenty-four precious days</seg><seg type="columnLine">in covering twenty-six miles, and each day</seg><seg type="columnLine">of grace was worth a regiment to Schuyler</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his weakened army.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We met several scores of soldiers strag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling into the road from the bush. These,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although having been in contact with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy, were not suffering from panic. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">did seem to be disprited. Possibly a ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jority of them should have been in the hos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pital. Three wagon drivers were emptying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brine from their casks of pork to lessen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the load, thus spoiling the pork. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">due to ignorance rather than fear, for other-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise they would have cut loose the horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two men--nay, mere boys--attracted</seg><seg type="columnLine">my attention by their extreme youth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their emaciation. They barely managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk and clung to each other for mutual</seg><seg type="columnLine">support. Horses were useless where I pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed going, and I signaled the Oneida to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismount. The two invalids halted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm and one of them drew a knife, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only weapon they seemed to possess. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagined the Indian and I intended to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">their scalps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get up on the horses.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">motioned the Oneida to retire a few rods and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I laid my Deckhard on the ground to aid</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in mounting. They did not attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to thank me with words, but their lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembled and big tears rolled down their</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor cheeks. They rode away to safety.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I briefly explained to my companion the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things told me by General Schuyler, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes flamed as he heard the name of St.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Luc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "His warriors will be very thick in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods," he hissed. "It is good. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">western Indians shall show the Elder Broth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers how to fight. It is said the Oneidas are</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick to learn."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had covered about three out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixteen miles between Fort Edward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fort Anne, and now it was time to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road and strike through the timber due</seg><seg type="columnLine">east so as to pass some ten miles below</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fort Anne. This course I hoped would</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring me in contact with General St. Clair's</seg><seg type="columnLine">army. For the first few miles we took</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage of the game trails and covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">104</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the ground quickly. Until night came we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">made no efforts to conceal our advance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Oneida bagged several grouse and as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I had procured a small supply of salt while</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at Edward I fared well. Before sunrise we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were racing toward the east. After two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hours of fast work the Oneida in the lead</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">threw out his hand as a signal for me to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">halt. I heard it, a heavy, crashing sound</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">far ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The axmen," I murmured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We soon came up to them; sullen, deter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mined fellows, who knew they risked their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lives each moment they paused to impede</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the advance of Burgoyne's army. For</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">every two choppers there was a man on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">guard with a flintlock. First would come</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the cloud of Indians, and last the veteran</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of Portugal and his regulars. Could I have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">known that those continental honors were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">i to receive no luster from our northern</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">woods I would not have felt so downhearted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as I watched the backwoodsmen bring down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tree after tree. The men scowled fiercely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the Oneida, who stared straight ahead,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">leaving it for me to obtain free passage for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him. And I doubt if he could have trav-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ersed the barricaded area alive if my ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">planation had not served as road-belt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The axmen gave back doggedly and only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when they had left a chevaux-de-frise behind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them. Now began our difficulties. Huge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trees had carried down those of lesser</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">growth, and the long winrows presented</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a rare jumble of splintered branches and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upright boughs. So thorough was the work</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in spots that it did not seem as if a weasel</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could get through. But the Tree Breaker,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with the cunning of his clan tutelary, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Bear, glided around and climbed over and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dived under, our route often being circuit-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ous yet always swinging back to the east.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Indian always kept ahead, his painted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">head and oiled body shining like a snake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Here in the woods his facial decorations were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">most ghastly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He dropped on his knees and wriggled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">under a huge bole. I followed at his heels,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but instead of rising he remained flat on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his stomach. I drew myself beside him,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and he whispered:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An Ottawa. A very big man. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">should be very brave. Wait for me." Be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fore I could remonstrate, or ask a question,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he glided like a snake into the debris and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was gone. Some ants from a rotten log</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">began to explore me, much to my incon-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">venience. In the north I heard the howling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of wolves, the dead in the forest tempting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them to the hunting before it was dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then came a subdued scuffling sound, near-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by but cut off from my line of vision by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thick growth. I located it as being just</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beyond a prostrate pine, the branches of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which formed a green wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I stared at this two brown hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared, clutching the boughs, and a moc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casined foot was thrust through and rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the trunk. I raised my rifle, then lowered</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, as through the screen stepped the Tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">Breaker. He held something above his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and howled his scalp-cry. Then with</seg><seg type="columnLine">grotesque steps, striking his feet smartly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the forest mold, he danced to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiding place. While he was thus indulging</seg><seg type="columnLine">his vanity, another hand appeared through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the green tangle, and another Indian stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the tree trunk and fitted an arrow to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow. I knocked him backward, killing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him instantly, his bare legs remaining in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Oneida wheeled and leaped to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">victim and was soon repeating his scalp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry, and was dancing back with two, instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one, gory trophies. From the song he</seg><seg type="columnLine">improvised I learned that both Indians</seg><seg type="columnLine">were Ottawas, "big as forest trees, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly broken down by the mighty Tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">Breaker of the Bear Clan of the Oneida</seg><seg type="columnLine">people." Not a word as to 'my part in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tragedy. I finally managed to secure his</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention and upbraided him for risking</seg><seg type="columnLine">our lives by calling the dead warriors' com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions down upon us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ho, White One who shoots before a tree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cat can snarl, there were but two.

I replied:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The sun drinks up the cloud.

It was impossible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">read beneath the hideous mask of paint on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tree Breaker's face, but he could not sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">press the excitement shining in his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was keyed up to great adventures and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand was ever on the handle of his toma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hawk, his quick gaze sweeping half circles</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he sought enemies in ambush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our progress was interrupted by a call for</seg><seg type="columnLine">help instead of by a war-cry.

The faint voice mouthing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one word "help" died down into a groan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Oneida's nostrils pinched in and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage little eyes became dancing dots as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sought to locate the sufferer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Water! water! For the love of God--</seg><seg type="columnLine">water!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A wounded man," I whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let the Tree Breaker go and bring him</seg><seg type="columnLine">here," he said.

I was stood on my feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the make-believe sick man also stood up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brushed the twigs and dirt from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest clothes and bowed prettily, sweeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hat to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"AH, M'SIEU, of the Soft Heart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I salute you.

Completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounding us was a circle of savages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">naked except for loin cloths, or a shirt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These were tall, brawny fellows, fantastically</seg><seg type="columnLine">painted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From their stature I took them to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ottawas.

Of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">The White Dawn</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">water I could not get enough.

His people will</seg><seg type="columnLine">never hang their heads. His women will</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell his children how he died." The Mohawk</seg><seg type="columnLine">interpreted this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I finished eating and the Indians about</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fires bolted the last mouthfuls in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">impatience to witness how an American</seg><seg type="columnLine">could die.

Now he</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked to the middle of the camp and</seg><seg type="columnLine">briefly harangued the red men and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a pretense of departing. But I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the bushes move where he remained to</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch secretly the torture. Left to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercies of the warriors I was courteously</seg><seg type="columnLine">addressed by a Caughnawaga, who request-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed me to stand up while they arranged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">post. The post was the tree to which I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been tied. This was trimmed to a height of</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve feet. When they had finished I</seg><seg type="columnLine">called the Caughnawaga's attention to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stump of a small branch and asked that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">be smoothed off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a blow of his ax he did as I asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then shouted to his own people:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ho!

That was the crevice in my armor;</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had not practised faith, and I feared I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmanly in waiting until in the last ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremity before asking for help. I never had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the respect for the eleventh hour worker</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the vineyard that I had for him who came</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the early morning.

He pulled a cord encircling</seg><seg type="columnLine">his neck until an Indian pipe that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung down his back was resting on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep chest. It was richly decorated with</seg><seg type="columnLine">feathers, each feather being symbolic and</seg><seg type="columnLine">only understood, perhaps, by the bearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the western Indians, as the latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass pipes instead of belts. Removing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cord the Oneida placed the pipe on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the robe.

I also believed St.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Luc's Indians knew this to be the fact and</seg><seg type="columnLine">admired him the more for it. I never got</seg><seg type="columnLine">the truth from the Tree Breaker, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">I later questioned him about the belts.

The Indian gave him no</seg><seg type="columnLine">heed. The savages pressed about St. Luc</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fingered the belt eagerly. Through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a double thickness of the leather the rivet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing tacks formed a Fleur-de-lis and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">letters, 'C. L.' There was no mistaking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt. The Indians identified it with little</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunts. I do not know what measure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendship existed between St. Luc and</seg><seg type="columnLine">de Langlade, but I do know that St. Luc</seg><seg type="columnLine">would rather lose a nation of his red allies</seg><seg type="columnLine">than to lose the man who helped to plot</seg><seg type="columnLine">Braddock's destruction.. St. Luc addressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the savages in their several dialects, asking--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"My children, what shall we do with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">trade-belt?

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oneida might lose his medicine next time</seg><seg type="columnLine">and be captured.

I could not under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand what they said, no more than when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ottawas registered their decision. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the Canadian Mohawks spoke I drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">my first free breath; for the spokesman said--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We must have the Little Father with us."</seg><seg type="columnLine">To the Oneida St. Luc said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We pick up the trade-belt.

Fair skies, a sea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass and faultless turbines had conspired to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the voyage uneventful. From the first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. L. Apworth Meredith had suffered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tedium of the long Pacific passage. Shuf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fle-board, deck quoits and all the other hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred and one inventions of travel-weary voy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agers had from long association become</seg><seg type="columnLine">classed as imbecilic in the mind of Mrs. Mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edith. Ocean travel was to her a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pure business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By other names and in different personali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties Mrs. Meredith had sailed the Seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seas. To Captain Juggins of the tramp</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ulysses, who had brought her as passenger</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Cape Town around the Horn to Rio,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from there to Boston, U. S. A., she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the daughter of a missionary whose life of</seg><seg type="columnLine">privation and sacrifice had earned for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last the full burial rites of a Zulu chief-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain. Captain Svensen of the Swedish Karl</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gustav would have remembered her as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Russian princess making a tour of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world without the formalities of a numerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">attending suite. At present she posed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the widow of a gallant British officer some</seg><seg type="columnLine">months deceased and in her presumably</seg><seg type="columnLine">shallow memory almost forgotten. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin and saloon it was rumored that her</seg><seg type="columnLine">period of mourning was over; that her</seg><seg type="columnLine">widow's weeds, worn as a caterpillar wears</seg><seg type="columnLine">its cocoon, would soon be cast aside, allow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her to burst forth, a butterfly of fashion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Mrs. Meredith took pains to foster this</seg><seg type="columnLine">impression by a number of mild flirtations</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with the most prepossessing among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">male passengers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the shade of the promenade deck's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide canvas awning Mrs. Meredith half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat, half-reclined in her steamer chair, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention centered on two men, shipboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquaintances, who were seated at oppo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">site sides of a cloth-covered card-table play-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing chess. A steward had brought the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chessmen from the smoking-room hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, and the two men had been playing</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily since luncheon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Meredith had always thought of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient pastime as the slowest of all games,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort of mental gymnastics requiring long</seg><seg type="columnLine">study and more than ordinary intelligence</seg><seg type="columnLine">before it could be mastered. But these two</seg><seg type="columnLine">combatants of the checkered field played as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they were driven by a mad spirit of haste.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each player moved in turn, but move</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed move with bewildering rapidity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Out of curiosity Mrs. Meredith had counted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the number of times that the contestants</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reset the pieces, and to her certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge they had played more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty games since she had begun to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">tally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">From time to time during the afternoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">promenaders had paused to watch the chess-</seg><seg type="columnLine">play, and once she had heard a man say--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Rapid-fire chess, interesting and some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times brilliant."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had spoken as one having authority</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the subject of chess, and she had noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">how the older of the two contestants</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the speaker out of the comer of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye as he passed on along the deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both chess-players were known by name</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">117</seg><seg type="columnLine">118</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to Mrs. Meredith. The younger of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two, Barney Coburn, she had danced with</seg><seg type="columnLine">on several occasions and knew him to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he represented himself--a junior</seg><seg type="columnLine">attache of the American Legation in Peking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The other, an older man, had been pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to her as a Mr. Blodwen, a prosperous</seg><seg type="columnLine">American with interests in the Chinese</seg><seg type="columnLine">leather trade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A shrewd judge of men, this character-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ization had not satisfied Mrs. Meredith as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the man's real business on board the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Isota. Since leaving Honolulu, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain information relative to Blodwen's</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs had reached her ears, she had per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistently sought his acquaintance. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">secured an introduction, but Blodwen did.</seg><seg type="columnLine">not dance, preferring the company of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoking-room to that of the ship's parlors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Meredith knew nothing of the game of</seg><seg type="columnLine">chess, but if knowledge of that particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">pastime would promote relationship with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blodwen, that knowledge she resolved to</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquire. Much could happen in the five</seg><seg type="columnLine">days that would elapse before the Isota</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the Golden Gate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The afternoon had sped more quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">than Mrs. Meredith had thought possible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she was surprized when the declining</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun began to peep beneath the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck awning. Its rays slanted into the eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Blodwen, who sat with his back against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white wall of the cabin facing the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruffled sea. He looked up in annoyance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Had enough, Frank?" asked his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion, noticing Blodwen's distracted atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For this afternoon," answered the older</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, glancing at his watch and rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly from the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lifted his gray tweed cap and bowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly to Mrs. Meredith, who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting at his elbow all the afternoon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom he now noticed for the first time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You haven't looked at me for hours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Blodwen," said the widow reproach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Astonishing that beauty should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been so near and I unaware of its presence,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he replied with banal gallantry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That compliment, bald as it was, has</seg><seg type="columnLine">earned your pardon," laughed Mrs. Mere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dith. "You were so absorbed in your chess</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it took the sun himself to rouse you</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it. I am almost tempted to ask you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to teach me such a fascinating game."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her tone was just serious enough to call</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for a serious reply, and Blodwen rose to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasion as a trout in an untroubled pool</seg><seg type="columnLine">rises to the carefully tossed fly of the angler.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The game is fascinating," he said po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">litely, "and if you really care to learn the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moves I shall be glad to show you after</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was not averse to a prolonged tete-</seg><seg type="columnLine">a-tete with the charming widow even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had observed the carefully hidden wrin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kles at the corners of her eyes that told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him Mrs. Meredith was older than she</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished to appear. As far as age was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerned he himself was no longer young.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Despite his upright carriage, his black hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and keen eyes, there was an air of sophisti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation, of self-assuredness about the man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that made Mrs. Meredith estimate his age</seg><seg type="columnLine">at somewhere in the forties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blodwen's hair betrayed a certain van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity, for it was not his own. Even an</seg><seg type="columnLine">expert would have looked twice, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before discovering the fact that he wore a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wig.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The call to dinner interrupted her accep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance of Blodwen's invitation, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">later in the evening before she saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. The promenade deck had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared of steamer chairs and a dance was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in progress. The soft strains of a waltz</seg><seg type="columnLine">floated to the ears of Blodwen as he leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">idly against the steamer's rail just aft of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge and watched the thin wisp of smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his cigar drift in wavy lines toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern of the Isota. A crescent moon hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing low in the western sky silvered the mill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pond calm of the Pacific with a broad path</seg><seg type="columnLine">of beauty that stretched from the steamer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rail to the far horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Isota seemed to glide through. the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividing waters with scarcely a whisper</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the white line of foam rushing smooth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly past the black hull twenty feet below</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he stood. Only the relentless throb</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mighty heart-beats told of the driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">force that urged the vessel onward. Lulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the calm serenity of the night, Blodwen</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgot for the first time during the voyage</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little oilskin packet pinned to the inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket of his vest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The clear tones of a woman's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled him from his reverie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have come to claim your promise of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this afternoon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned quickly. Mrs. Meredith stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his elbow. With a quick motion he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed his half-smoked cigar overboard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The "Double Thirteen"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">119</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You need not have done that," she pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tested. "I don't object to cigar-smoke."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"So you are really in earnest about learn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to play chess?" asked Blodwen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly. Why not? Do you consider</seg><seg type="columnLine">me too stupid?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no, not that. Your request sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prized me because I thought that your</seg><seg type="columnLine">taste for amusement favored more active</seg><seg type="columnLine">pastimes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You thought that I had rather dance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for instance?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Something like that, yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks for your candor. But, really,</seg><seg type="columnLine">your games with Mr. Coburn this afternoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely fascinated me. I feel that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply must learn chess."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The game is difficult."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am not frightened."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then when would you like to begin?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blodwen was surprized at Mrs. Mere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dith's haste. He had taught chess to many</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, but he had never found a woman so</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager to learn the game. He glanced at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his watch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is already nine o'clock," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then the sooner we start the better.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That is, unless you repent of your bargain."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blodwen laughed negatively and offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm. Side by side they descended the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad companionway iifto one of the Isota's</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliantly lighted parlors. A steward was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispatched to bring chessboard and men</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the smoking-room while Mrs. Mere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dith and Blodwen seated themselves at</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite sides of a small mahogany table</seg><seg type="columnLine">to await his return.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cabin furnishings of the Isota were</seg><seg type="columnLine">as new as the ship itself. Tapestries, rugs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictures and bric-a-brac proclaimed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">their spotlessness a recent origin. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rosewood box brought by the steward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its contents of ebony and boxwood</seg><seg type="columnLine">chessmen were new. The green-and-white</seg><seg type="columnLine">chessboard shone in its first coat of virgin</seg><seg type="columnLine">varnish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How gallant they look!" commented</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Meredith as Blodwen arranged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces on their proper squares.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He recalled the battered chessmen that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had seen in the chess clubs of the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smiled ironically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In a few months," he remarked, "the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knights will be noseless, the battlements of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rooks will be chipped off and the pawns</seg><seg type="columnLine">will have grown dingy with much handling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">These little armies, so spotless now, will</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon become dilapidated and disreputable."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Meredith gave a little shiver of</seg><seg type="columnLine">annoyance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "B-r-r-r!" she exclaimed. "You make</seg><seg type="columnLine">me think of Time and Death. Cheer up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tell me their names again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blodwen laughed and cast aside the feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of oppression that had suddenly come</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him as he entered the cabin. Chess</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a favorite pastime with him, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">exerted himself to make it so with Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meredith. He explained carefully 'the</seg><seg type="columnLine">powers of the pieces, their manner of mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, gave illustrations of "check" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"checkmate," and grew more and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprized to find Mrs. Meredith an eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">and attentive pupil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Time passed quickly. The influx of</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers into the cabin told that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening's dance was over. He looked ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioningly at Mrs. Meredith, but she shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Please don't stop yet," she pleaded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Meredith's maid came and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind her mistress. She was young and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the type known as "dressy." Her prox-</seg><seg type="columnLine">imity seemed to exasperate Mrs. Meredith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go away; you distract my attention,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said petulantly. , "Stand behind Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blodwen. See if you can make him ner-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vous."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Obediently the girl carried out her mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tress' order. Blodwen glanced up. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">maid's face seemed unnaturally pale in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of the cabin lamps, but except for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hardly noticed her. The three were alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the parlor now. Blodwen glanced at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch. It was one o'clock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just one more game," begged Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meredith. "If you give me your queen</seg><seg type="columnLine">again I think I can almost beat you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blodwen smiled agreeably and assembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pieces. The maid, who had remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing behind him, shifted her position</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly. A subtle perfume, oddly familiar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stole from her hair or clothing. What was</seg><seg type="columnLine">there about the smell that reminded him of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hospital ward?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The air in the cabin seemed close. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was becoming drowsy. In spite of himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head nodded. He roused sufficiently to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see if Mrs. Meredith had observed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleepiness. Her blond head was bent for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, her eyes intent on the chessboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Blodwen drew a long breath.

He thought that the girl be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind him had moved nearer. Did he dream,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or had her soft arm stolen around his neck?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS daylight when Blodwen</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened his eyes. He was in his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">stateroom, fully dressed, lying awk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wardly, half in, half out of his berth. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin door stood open, and on the threshold</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Japanese steward bowed politely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A wireless for the Mr. Blodwen," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, extending an envelope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blodwen's brain cleared rapidly. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinctively he knew what had happened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As a matter of form he felt for the oilskin</seg><seg type="columnLine">packet that should have reposed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside pocket of his vest although he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">beforehand that the package would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">missing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the certainty of his loss came re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning strength. He sprang suddenly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet and confrpnted the steward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look, boy!" he demanded. "Who</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought me here last.night?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Japanese, startled from his smiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">complacency, shrugged his shoulders and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook his head negatively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I find the Mr. Blodwen's key in the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">just now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Assured by the boy's attitude that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke the truth and knew nothing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night's happenings, Blodwen made no</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt to question him further but took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the envelope that the steward still patiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended toward him. He tore it open.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three short sentences stretched across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheet:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   A Mrs. Meredith aboard.

The warning</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come too late.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The effects of the drug that had robbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him of consciousness were not lasting; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found himself steady on his feet, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his active brain raced with plans for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovery of his property. He faced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation with calmness, indulging in no</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-recrimination. His carelessness had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought its own punishment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment his thoughts dwelt on Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meredith. It was perfectly plain to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">now that behind her desire to learn the</seg><seg type="columnLine">game lurked an ulterior motive. Now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had accomplished her object she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to other forms of amusement. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have surprized him to know that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Meredith had that morning borrowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ship's library a volume of Hoyle</seg><seg type="columnLine">containing a section devoted to the royal</seg><seg type="columnLine">pastime, which, together with the chessmen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had taken to her stateroom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without questioning the steward further</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blodwen sought the captain of the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Matsu, commanding officer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Isota, a graduate of Oxford, with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inordinate pride in his English university</seg><seg type="columnLine">training, acknowledged Blodwen's self-in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">troduction with a perfect imitation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Briton's bluntness and listened imper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turifebly to his story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slightly excited, Blodwen was neverthe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less calm enough to place his facts before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain in logical sequence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To begin with," he said, "I represent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">firm of Pendergast &amp; Hartley, diamond</seg><seg type="columnLine">importers, of New York City.

She has been at it so long that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she knows how nearly impossible it will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her to bring anything ashore without</seg><seg type="columnLine">our knowing its nature. Where an unsus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected person might land practically with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out molestation she on the contrary will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">subjected to a most rigorous search.

Half an hour later it disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether when Gilvrain's man reported to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that Mrs. Meredith had made good</seg><seg type="columnLine">her escape. Blodwen decided that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">high time to take a hand himself in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovery of his diamonds. Mrs. Meredith</seg><seg type="columnLine">must still be in the city. There were meth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ods of tracing her out. He sat down at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, burying his face in his hands to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilvrain had said that the diamonds</seg><seg type="columnLine">would probably be taken ashore by some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the passengers, some one above sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picion. In that case it was possible that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">necklace might still be on board the Isota.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Customs officials never searched an out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">going vessel.

Might it not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible that Mrs. Meredith had hidden the</seg><seg type="columnLine">necklace somewhere in her stateroom? If</seg><seg type="columnLine">such were the case, how simple it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her to engage the same room for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outward passage ten days or two weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">later and then to come aboard on the sailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">date and remove the necklace at her leisure!</seg><seg type="columnLine">A search of the stateroom might prove</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth while.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The "Double Thirteen''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">123</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      HIS train of thought was interrupt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fyL ed by a disturbance in the smoking-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Two white-jacketed stew-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ards were in loud altercation in their incom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehensible jargon. From words their</seg><seg type="columnLine">argument grew to blows, and the larger of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two soon drove the smaller flying up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the broad companionway to the deck. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">second steward, as if nothing unusual had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened, began to move quietly about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushing ashes from the tables and other-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise putting the room in order.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Engrossed in his own troubles, Blodwen</seg><seg type="columnLine">had paid no attention to the quarrel of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stewards. His mind made up, he sprang to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet, determined to seek the captain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship and enlist his aid in a thorough</seg><seg type="columnLine">search of Mrs. Meredith's stateroom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he crossed from his chair to the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panionway the steward paused before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chessboard where the pieces had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily shoved into a heap at the conclusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of last evening's play and gathered them</seg><seg type="columnLine">into their rosewood box. Then instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">placing the box back on the shelf he tucked</seg><seg type="columnLine">it under his arm and followed Blodwen up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the deck evening shadows had begun</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stretch black arms across the promenade.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Against the white row of staterooms, clearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlined by the level rays of the setting sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crossed lines of the steamer's cordage</seg><seg type="columnLine">wove an intricate pattern like the web of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gigantic spider.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blodwen was surprized at the hush on</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck. A few hours before, the bulwarks had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hedged in a crowd of eager passengers. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rail swung in a deserted curve back past</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bulge of the cabin toward the stern of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship. Passengers had vanished; but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaning against the ladder that led upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the pilot-house and the hurricane deck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Matsu was talking excitedly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a steward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was quiet on the upper decks of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Isota, but from the hold and from the dock</seg><seg type="columnLine">echoed the ceaseless crash of the steamer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">unloading. From below an endless stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">of man-propelled trucks emptied to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wharf, clattering and rumbling away into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadowy distances of the barn-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">dock-sheds. Scattered arc lamps cast a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitful glare upon the dim figures moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a procession of gnomes or pixies into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the far corners of the structure. Among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless bales and boxes thus disappearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his view Blodwen wondered if any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">individual package secreted the Double</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thirteen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The clank of a windlass and the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a donkey engine drowned out for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment the rumbling of trucks. A huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">packing-case, large enough to contain</seg><seg type="columnLine">a piano, lumbered across the wide gang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plank, a stevedore on either side to steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and a giant longshoreman pushing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truck on which it rode.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blodwen, watching idly, saw a fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">man step out from behind its shelter as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels of the truck clattered on the wharf.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The flash of the man's white jacket as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodged for an instant into the light of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">arc lamp identified him as one of the Isota's</seg><seg type="columnLine">stewards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His evident desire to escape observation</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused Blodwen's suspicions. Acting on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sudden impulse, he turned and hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the gangplank, eyes searching for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the retreating figure now vanished in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloom of the great shed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment he thought that the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given him the slip. Then, as his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed themselves to the partial dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, he saw a distant gleam of white and</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickened his steps. At the next arc lamp</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gap between himself and the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">jacket had materially lessened. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost at the steward's heels when the Jap</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the outskirts of the shed and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly to the right, passing into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street through a narrow door, almost con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cealed from view by a pile of packing-cases.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blodwen, following swiftly, stopped him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self by catching the door-frame as he heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">a familiar voice ask--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you got them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was still light enough in the street for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blodwen, peering through the open door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, to recognize the well-tailored figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mrs. Meredith. She stood on the curb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone of a narrow sidewalk, one foot resting</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the running-board of a big black limou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sine, whose throbbing bulk completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled the cramped roadway from warehouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">to warehouse.

Thirty seconds later he was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the public telephone in the drug-store across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the avenue. His voice as he spoke over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wire had none of the accents of a Japanese.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the contrary it was sharp, authoritative</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thoroughly American.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Captain Prentiss," the voice said, "this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is Barney Coburn of the Secret Service.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Send a squad of men to the Imperial at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">and arrest two men and two women who</seg><seg type="columnLine">will arrive there shortly in a black limou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sine.

Consequently when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard your story I watched the Isota's</seg><seg type="columnLine">chessmen as a jealous miser watches his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoard.

"She has two sets of chessmen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He opened the box and poured its con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tents out on the table. By this time Gil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vrain, wise in the Customs Service, knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was coming. He smiled as Coburn</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to operate on the chessmen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With strong fingers Coburn tore the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green felt covering from the bottom of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black king and with the point of his pen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife picked at the circular plug that</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared beneath it. The wood came loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand, and he noted that the thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">coating of lead that had been used to weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">the piece and keep it upright had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">scraped away. He shook the king, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the orifice a ball of tightly wadded</seg><seg type="columnLine">cotton slipped to the palm of his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Industriously he worked at the bottoms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the other pieces while Gilvrain looked on</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a broadening smile.

He had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered good money to take some position</seg><seg type="columnLine">permanently, but had smilingly refused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Work delayed him. Ordinary human en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deavor was distasteful to him except as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">means to an end. He was not lazy, he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor much along his own lines. He walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of miles. He dug for weeks with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick and shovel to see what was under</seg><seg type="columnLine">some crumbling ruin. He hid in the jungles</seg><seg type="columnLine">for months spying out the habits of animals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds, and insects. He scaled cliffs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">peered off of mountains. He explored the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior of yawning caves in the earth. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat up tons of various sorts of rocks to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what they were made of. He analyzed saps</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gums.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No danger held him back. He had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">among savage tribes and had fought them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself fierce as a savage and more cunning</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they interfered with what he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing. From fifteen to thirty-five he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived twenty years of life packed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">incident.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he arrived at a certain Andean</seg><seg type="columnLine">copper-mining camp his hair was hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">two feet down his back. Chance had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him to the camp, the chance of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few grains of corn dropped on a llama path</seg><seg type="columnLine">many days distant from the camp. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">company had bought corn from a tribe of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians living far down the side of the east-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern slopes of the mountains. A sack had</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaked and he had followed, picking up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">eating the grains, over barren stretches</seg><seg type="columnLine">and through bleak mountain passes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was on the fag end of a long trip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had walked the incredible distance from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rio de Janeiro, the entire width of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">South American continent, a matter of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand miles as a crow flies, and for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most part through unknown and unex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">plored territory. The jaunt had taken him</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighteen months.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had run out of ammunition and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown away his carbine and revolver and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was carrying a Cashibo blow-gun, a roll of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny darts like knitting-needles, an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense bow, and a bundle of large, bone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barbed arrows. These he had taken from</seg><seg type="columnLine">an Indian who had stalked him for "days for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his flesh and head. More cunning than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian, he had sprung from the fork of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree and -had throttled the savage with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His clothes were in tatters, tied with</seg><seg type="columnLine">strings of beaten bark, patched with bits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin of beast and fowl. He could scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak English from not having spoken it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in so long.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tarried not to bandy useless words</seg><seg type="columnLine">with men who stared open-mouthed as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled down the road in front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office buildings and storerooms. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place had a company mess-house, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he had sighted it he turned off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main road and cut across the lot to the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To an apron-clad American he made known</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that he had not had a square meal</seg><seg type="columnLine">for months.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was given food at a little kitchen</seg><seg type="columnLine">table in the corner. The animal within</seg><seg type="columnLine">him grew ravenous. â€¢ He ate greedily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sucking and smacking over it in an ecstasy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of enjoyment; then, as his straining nerves</seg><seg type="columnLine">relaxed, he went sound asleep, sprawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his plate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rough men came and stared curiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him and while he slept they bathed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaved, and doctored him with salves and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ointments, then put him to bed. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">subconscious self had relaxed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This subconscious self had not slept an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant in eighteen months. It had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained awake, watchful, even when his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body was deep in slumber, rousing him at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slightest sound of danger. He slept for</seg><seg type="columnLine">two days and two nights without waking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, when he did arouse, he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">new clothes on a chair beside his cot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Within a few days he was at work, bossing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gang of Quechua laborers at the ore</seg><seg type="columnLine">tipple. He became "one of the bunch," a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange bunch, birds of passage, T. T. T.'s,</seg><seg type="columnLine">contract men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men crowded near him in the club of</seg><seg type="columnLine">evenings when they gathered after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day's work, and asked him eagerly of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long hike. He told the story simply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">128</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He had walked the Estrada Central from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rio de Janeiro to Sao Jose dos Campos,</seg><seg type="columnLine">four hundred miles from Rio, and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">there--he stepped to a wall map and indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicated an east and west course across</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brazil and into the interior of Peru.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke of the jungles, silent, dim as</seg><seg type="columnLine">twilight at noon; the swamps and deserts;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mighty rivers and rapid streams; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast Aades, slashed and gashed with yawn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing canons, buttressed with cliffs, pitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with great caverns, spanning from tropic</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat to perpetual ice. He spoke of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangers of his lone struggle, the caution he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had used, the grim fighting he had done with</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild men and with wild nature. Yet, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">some one let slip a question why he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made this trip he started to answer, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a couple of months curiosity of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd toward him waned, for which he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">modestly thankful. He became apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cog of the company machine whose busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness was to mine and ship out copper to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilized world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet with his renewed strength he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun anew to pilgrimage into unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">fields of thought. He managed to get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small cottage on the hill above the smelter</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his own use, one of the three-room cot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tages set apart for married employees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Several were vacant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here Keene did a staggering amount of</seg><seg type="columnLine">work of evenings and at night. Often</seg><seg type="columnLine">he worked far into the morning hours.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Water, earth, air, fire, ice, metal, insect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">plant--he experimented with them, tested,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissolved, took them to pieces, and divided</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cells, to find out the laws that govern</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He discovered that down to an infinity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">minuteness each cell was composed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">others bound together yet possessing indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vidual force. Animal and plant cells had</seg><seg type="columnLine">an intelligence suitable to their needs, living</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own lives but adding to the total life</seg><seg type="columnLine">of whatever they composed. Each cell had</seg><seg type="columnLine">its own supply of force, revolved on its axis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">went through phases, and was a world unto</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some of these things had been touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon by scientists. Keene went deep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep, to the bottom. He connected ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate with inanimate, vegetal with animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, the earth with our universe, our uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse with other universes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He got hold of facts that hitherto were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown, although men had almost grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Keene proved them by chemistry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with mathematics, by faultless deduction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He lay hold of the exact laws that govern</seg><seg type="columnLine">all things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was amazed at the revelations his</seg><seg type="columnLine">work had disclosed. He had found rules by</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he could understand almost anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">he attempted to fathom. He stood in awe</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the magnitude of these laws, their dove-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tailed perfection from an infinity of small-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness through the gamut to an infinity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatness. He became the greatest intel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lect of his time; he was aware of this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keene did not feel a swelling egoism.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew too much to give undue value to</seg><seg type="columnLine">any one person. One man, even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">that man be himself, was too small an atom</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the scheme of things for him to thrill over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did feel, however, a responsibility,</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific in its gravity, that rested upon him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw, and saw plainly, things that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">help mankind and through it animalkind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and vegetalkind. He saw methods to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasten the march of protoplasm upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, to speed evolution toward the goal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfection, to make man more of a man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">less of a beast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOW he began to frequent the club.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took better care of his person.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He cultivated friendships. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">seclusion he came out and bubbled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">sociability.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When some one asked about a detail of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his travels he dilated upon them. He spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men and women and things of other</seg><seg type="columnLine">lands. With sweeping strokes of clear-cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">English he painted scenes and events, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">held his friends spellbound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This all was a part of his plan. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the history of man. He was well aware that</seg><seg type="columnLine">humankind is wary of thoughts a trifle be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the narrow limits of any particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">period, that it kills, crucifies, burns at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stake, destroys the life of men ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their time in thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Future generations judge coldly the acts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their predecessors. They build monu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments to men the mob has torn to pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scorned. But they, in turn, are ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fall upon similar men in their own midst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Robert Keene did not wish to be a martyr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wanted to live to be of use, to help</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighten the burdens of humanity, to strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">off a few false shackles, to throw a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">beams of light along the way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Rolling Stone</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">129</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was with superhuman cunning that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to put the balance of his scheme into</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect. He started to interject words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">phrases, expressions, thoughts, into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">talks that would bring out some natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">or biological fact, some intellectual gem,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some truth that would live until the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. He casually mentioned that certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">portions of South America were in tho</seg><seg type="columnLine">midst of remote ages of evolution. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed that animal life and vegetal life</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken strange turns in such places, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that present-day descendants of supposedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">extinct flora and fauna existed, differing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but little from those of three million years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago, while others also existed which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily three million years ahead of any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He mentioned plants that closed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">small animals and insects and devoured</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, of other parasitic plants that moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their own volition from place to place on</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree trunks, of others that grew hollow pods</seg><seg type="columnLine">or knots in which to house certain venomous</seg><seg type="columnLine">or vicious insects to protect them; he men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned the reproduction of each kind, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hybrids that have formed to start other</seg><seg type="columnLine">species.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went into many descriptions about</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals, birds, and reptiles he had observed;</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant toads whose sweat of anger is a deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">poison, other toads whose pores are used as</seg><seg type="columnLine">an incubator for their eggs, lizards which half</seg><seg type="columnLine">fly and half walk over the water, cannibal</seg><seg type="columnLine">fish, snakes of unbelievable length, myriad</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms of bird life, monstrous apes and wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">men hitherto unknown, tiny worms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects of amazing shapes and propensities.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The facts were almost incredible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, the men who had drifted to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp were a broad-minded lot. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves were rolling stones who had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">things and had thought. They connected</seg><seg type="columnLine">these descriptions with similar things they</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves had seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From English-speaking countries they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come, and from all other countries</seg><seg type="columnLine">where white men hold sway. The experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence of any twenty of them would span the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's crust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were among them an English lord;</seg><seg type="columnLine">a professor who had held a chair of language</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Oxford and later had been a private</seg><seg type="columnLine">tutor to a prince of the Punjab in India; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">German count--an Imperial spy--who se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cretly was a high official of one of the largest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">steamship companies in the world; a man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">9	V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been president of a bank in Den-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ver; a chemist who had taught his subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-nine years in one of the best colleges</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the United States; a former big-league</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball-player; a renowned pistol champion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Others had been experts in various lines;</seg><seg type="columnLine">some were hoboes and a few'were plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">bums. Some had pasts that came in</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispers from the outside. Some expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">futures in quick promotion to high salaries</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused by the short stay that many men</seg><seg type="columnLine">made at this high, bleak, wind-swept camp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All in all they were a good lot. The bond</seg><seg type="columnLine">of good-fellowship was strong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet broad-minded as they were, intel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lectual as they were, experienced as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, they began to doubt the deductions</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Keene arrived at, because he went a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trifle beyond their depths. He saw in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and read in their faces this vague, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed doubt tinged with an incompre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hensible trace of anger for having made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunge. This grew more pronounced as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeded with his talks. They listened</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully to actual descriptions, but when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he tried to make a point from such data</seg><seg type="columnLine">they walked away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keene moved back to the bachelor quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters. He tried to give his knowledge to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them individually. He tried by sheer force</seg><seg type="columnLine">of argument to compel an acceptance of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">facts and logic. He continued to frequent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the club and to devise plans to make his</seg><seg type="columnLine">words interesting without resorting to actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiction or lying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men began to look curiously at the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at him when he talked. Keene watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">these reactions carefully. He could frame</seg><seg type="columnLine">words to express what he did not hear:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's too bad; he's a trifle off; he's been</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit by the sun. The trail hammered him</seg><seg type="columnLine">too hard. He's missed too many boats."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keene noted that the camp surgeon, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">former Panama Canal man, closely ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served his bodily reflexes and coordinations.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was being passed upon by a jury which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was half convinced of his insanity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This cut deep. These men were his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of man. They were rolling stones--</seg><seg type="columnLine">his class. But he was the master rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone, the master rambler of them all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he was the thinker. Where they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">just punctured the shell of mass thought he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had plunged through and had probed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">universe. He was not trying to sell them</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything. He was trying to give away</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge. He was an intellectual good</seg><seg type="columnLine">130</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow striving to lend a helping hand with</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It hurt him to see the antagonism in</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds an'd faces. It was a hard slap in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. He knew some men did in reaiity go</seg><seg type="columnLine">insane when the best that, was in them was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unappreciated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He worried over it, trying to solve the</seg><seg type="columnLine">why of it. That it did exist there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">question. So he left off trying and with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew into his shell. He moved back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cottage, and bachelor quarters sighed in re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lief when he was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There in the cottage he admitted that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first round had been against him. If this</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad-minded gathering of men would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">accept him what had he to hope from inex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perienced, shallow-thinking groups? They</seg><seg type="columnLine">would lock him up as unsound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was no quitter, this man. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">game to the marrow in his bones. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">won battles by fighting when he was whipped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He began to look at his failure in an ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stract way as if it was something apart</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him. His reasoning had been fault-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less when he tried to impart knowledge. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no mere babbling of loose words; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had weighed each one and he had seen them</seg><seg type="columnLine">take effect. A trifle later had come the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaction against them and him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Poverty! He had the solution. Poverty</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wisdom were not synonymous. Men</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked to the materially successful for words</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wisdom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This habit had begun five hundred thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand years ago around the common camp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire of the hairy man ape. Those who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been successful or lucky in the chase with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled stone or club were the center of at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traction. Some meat might he left over.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those who had no food gathered around</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who had, listening with awe-struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces as the wise one with sundry grunts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clicks, growls, and whistles entertained</seg><seg type="columnLine">them with narratives of prowess. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">association of ideas had lasted down through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ages--Abundance and Wisdom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taking the angle of the others and looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at himself, Keene went into the matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">coldly. A tramp who had hiked into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp hungry, almost naked, men would</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally look upon with a certain associa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of ideas. They would like to know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">he got food, how he slept, how he pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served his life, how he lasted through. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hard to associate the events, the man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with real or superior knowledge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he saw himself as a foreman over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang of Indians. It was true he was paid a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and seventy-five dollars a month,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but this was little compared to what other</seg><seg type="columnLine">men received. He had noticed that men</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid more attention to the ones who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer the top of the heap, and in almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">direct proportion to their earnings. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a truth, a sad, sordid truth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keene now began to spend his holidays</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Sundays in strolling through the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains. Lunch in pocket, geologist hammer</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hand, he walked along studying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. He was not looking for biological</seg><seg type="columnLine">or geological facts. He was looking for gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">ore, diamonds, precious stones, minerals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">things that men prized and paid hard cash</seg><seg type="columnLine">for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He left off talking to men, and they, duly</seg><seg type="columnLine">thankful, took this as a new phase of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental unbalance. Those who saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">sneaking from the camp on a prospecting-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tour nudged each other and grinned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That sort of visionary had often been in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their midst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day Keene was passing over a pile of</seg><seg type="columnLine">coal ashes, back of the power-house, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the firemen had dumped there against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time the section foreman would consider</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amount worth while to load on a flat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">car and use as ballast for the track, or for</seg><seg type="columnLine">making walks between the buildings. Keene</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped and stared fixedly at those coal</seg><seg type="columnLine">cinders for several minutes. Stooping, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered up a handful and stuffed them into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night Keene went to the club-house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Bert Daley, general manager, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting a game of billiards with Charley</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barron, commissary clerk. Keene saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and edged over to Daley's elbow. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bert stood, chalking his cue between shots,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keene touched his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Daley," he said confidentially, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think those ashes over back of the power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house are valuable."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Big Bert put his hand on Keene's shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked at him shrewdly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some more of that bug stuff, eh?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said with rough kindness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he lowered his voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keene, why don't you take a trip down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the coast and hang around for a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of weeks? Take a rest.

Keene persisted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daley's face reddened. He slammed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cue butt against the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then I would like, to have them, if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">please."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daley started as if to swear. He was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">big man with a big temper. Also he had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">big heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right; you can have them. You can</seg><seg type="columnLine">have any other ashes you want. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been a nuisance.

When he glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">back Keene had slipped out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That poor-is off his trolley bad.

As the bunch passed on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to work some of them came over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched Keene pottering around the pile</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ashes. He was noncommittal. Asking</seg><seg type="columnLine">among themselves, they learned he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">presented with the ashes. It was too bad.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bert Daley shouldn't have tried to humor</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on tins crazy scheme. It was really a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shame. The man was crazy--bugs!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keene paid little attention to them. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought numerous pots and pans at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">commissary and got to work. By night he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had put a portion of the cinders through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">process similar to panning gold. He had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold, though.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men had been curious enough to see just</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he did save from the ashes, and could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see nothing but a red liquid he kept pouring</seg><seg type="columnLine">from each panful to another pan in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saved it. In three days he had washed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole pile and had evaporated the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid into a red powder which he molded</seg><seg type="columnLine">into small tablets. In all he had about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quart bottle full.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That same night he drifted into the club.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Men stopped whatever they were doing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at him and grinned. He walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and stood at the fireplace watching</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Bert Daley shooting billiards. Bert Daley</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw him there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well, how's the ashes, Keene?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked, winking broadly to the chemist he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was playing with, the ex-college instructor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keene took out a small pill-box in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had a few of the tablets and tossed one</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the table. Daley picked it up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at it. It looked like the rough tablet</seg><seg type="columnLine">into which iodin is first concentrated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daley smelled of it and passed it to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemist. The# chemist took his pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass out and studied it gravely. He never</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen anything just like it. Keene</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They both looked up at him. His grin</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ah unmistakable grin of confidence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He held a pat hand. This was no bluff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What in--is that stuff?" asked Bert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chemist shook his head. Keene en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered into an explanation. He told how a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain rare chemical, very valuable, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">found now and then in coal ashes of certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorts of coal in about three places in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, and only at intervals in such veins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chemist bore witness to this fact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had heard of this chemical and knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">its name. And upon having Keene describe</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain properties he agreed that this was it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The crowd had gathered around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table when they saw something was hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pening. They took the tablet and passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it around and examined it. Few of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered the exact name but they remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered the value, for they heard Keene say in</seg><seg type="columnLine">reply to a question from Daley that already</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had about twenty thousand dollars'</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth, and was going to take a look at thr-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashes along the track to see if by chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were the right sort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A week later he had run the amount he</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed up to thirty-five thousand dollars'</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth, reckoned by the last quotation he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen. He had been down to the Moro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bamba coal-mine, forty miles away, a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany property, and made tests that proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">the streak had played out for the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">being.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sent the parcel of chemical by regis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered mail to a firm of wholesale chemists he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew in New York and waited for a reply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While it was coming he hung around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp, taking strolls into the mountains and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pottering around the smelter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end of a month Keene received a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cable telling him to call at a bank in Lima</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his money. The price had gone up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">132</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The cable stated that fifty thousand awaited</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.

The old chemist had known from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very night Keene had shown him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pellet that the find was a rich one. A few</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken his corroboration. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">majority had doubted. And with the pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of each day this doubt had grown. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">the word that Keene had gone to Lima to</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw so great an amount passed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth to mouth throughout the camp and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into the deep labyrinths of the mines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you think about that fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keene?

At, Dios! It was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast for comprehension. The white gringos</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a strange lot. The Senor Keene</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew much.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the excitement waned men remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered deep in their hearts of many ways in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they had mistreated Robert Keene.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sturdy-bodied, double-fisted, hairy-chested</seg><seg type="columnLine">men blushed with memories of winks they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed and smart sayings they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">uttered at Keene's expense.

They had trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gressed against their code--the square-deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">code of the Open Road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And brows knitted and men thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeply of things that Keene had tried to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. There was not a soul who expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">him back to the camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he came back the next night. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried a bag that bulged with the weight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">money.

He strode down the room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped Keene's hand and blurted out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">congratulations. The crowd trooped around</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and every man's face was beaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">with pleasure. Keene laughed uproariously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally he began to talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You men have got me into a nice fix.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm a student.

An addition was</seg><seg type="columnLine">built for a reading-room and books began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrive by boxfuls and find places on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows of shelves. The tables became lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered with periodicals and magazines. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand touches were added to the camp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the place took on an appearance of wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even the Quechua laborers and camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">followers found themselves in possession of</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean barracks and shanties.

It was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those tense moments when speech seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be strictly out of order.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was not a single man in the saloon</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that moment who had not been present</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Starlight dance hall two evenings</seg><seg type="columnLine">before when Sheriff Billy had announced</seg><seg type="columnLine">his policy of law and order for the future.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, by some trick of fate, some despicable</seg><seg type="columnLine">irony, Tom Danton, one of the deputies</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been sworn in to help toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">making Eagle County safe and sane, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the first to transgress.

Danton dropped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigaret on the floor and rose and put a foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it. Then his eyes encountered those</seg><seg type="columnLine">136</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sheriff. They looked full at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other a moment or two, then Sheriff Billy</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did anybody yere see this Arguelles go</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a gun?" the sheriff asked generally</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His tone was appealing, imploring, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his heart was a prayer that at least one</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in the crowd would answer in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">affirmative. But none of them answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything at all. They understood what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff was driving at and some of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed under their breath that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to help him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Or a knife or any weapon a-tall?" sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plemented Sheriff Billy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Joe Arguelles, he ees my frien', an' I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know w'at he got, an' he has no knife or</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun an' no nothin' to keel.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stooped and searched the body thoroughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at length got to his feet again with</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty hands.

Thompson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cigaret between his lips, sat on the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his spine in a chair thoughtfully gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the ceiling. Thus they had been sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a complete silence for the past ten or</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen minutes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If we'd only found a knife or somethin',</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack, mebbe we could fix it so Tom could</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim self-defense," Sheriff Billy's mournful</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice finally broke the silence.

As they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">passed along, other men fell in behind them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">At the Starlight saloon about twenty men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">joined the ranks, some mounted and others</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">afoot. It was at the saloon that Frio Bill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and his eleven cronies, all with their horses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined the procession.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the crowd reached the big cotton-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood tree that stood at the end of the street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sheriff Billy halted his prisoner directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">under a big limb and ordered the crowd to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand back. The crowd formed a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle about the sheriff and his prisoner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Early that morning Sheriff Billy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">posted a notice on the post-office door to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect that at high noon that day he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">hang Tom Danton by the neck for mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering Joe Arguelles. Everybody who could</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to see the sheriff of Eagle County</seg><seg type="columnLine">send a man to eternity via the hemp-rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">route.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quietly, yet with one eye always on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd, Sheriff Billy arranged one end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope he carried in a running noose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped the noose over his prisoner's head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Danton offered no objection. Between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough rope and the flesh of Danton's neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheriff placed a small folded saddle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanket, explaining that he had no desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">to disfigure the persons of those who died</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his hand. Danton thanked him for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfulness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The noose, at length satisfactorily ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged about the condemned man's neck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sheriff Billy tossed the free end over the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">limb and brought the rope to the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's my deputies?" he asked, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the circle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yore aimin' to hang one of 'em, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">stubborn old fool!" snarled Jack Thompson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I ain't hangin' 'em all, though mebbe</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would do 'em good if I did," retorted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sheriff Billy sarcastically".

A low murmur,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the muttering of a distant storm, arose</seg><seg type="columnLine">from many throats.

"Billy, yore the sheriff, all right, an' you</seg><seg type="columnLine">done said what you was a-goin' to do if there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was any more cold-blooded killin's in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">town," he said.

Childs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and several others started forward. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flash Sheriff Billy jerked out both his</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns and swung them up. His gray eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">glittered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll mess up the first man takes another</seg><seg type="columnLine">step!" he said in a quiet tone; but its quiet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness made it that more ominous. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys back up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those who had surged forward at Childs'</seg><seg type="columnLine">bidding stopped short and glowered at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff. None of them doubted that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would shoot if they went another step. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the prisoner himself, his face serious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who came to Sheriff Billy's assistance at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that critical moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Much oblige', boys, for yore good in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentions," Danton said, "but I'm askin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a personal favor you let this hangin' go</seg><seg type="columnLine">on.

I got a-honin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see what Heaven looks like."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sheriff Billy gave his prisoner a glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was a mixture of gratefulness and sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prize. Then his eyes went roving about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle again until they fell upon Frio Bill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frio Bill and all his companions were stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing together on one side of the circle holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">their horses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ain't nobody yere got enough sand to</seg><seg type="columnLine">help me string up this yere prisoner?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheriff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The invitation to participate in the hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing could not have been more direct had</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sheriff Billy mentioned Frio Bill's name.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Frio Bill was secretly delighted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">receive such an invitation. He hated Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">Danton for two reasons. First, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">Danton was a friend of the sheriff's, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hating the sheriff as he did Frio Bill natural-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly hated any friend of the sheriff's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Second, Joe Arguelles, the deceased, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very particular friend of Frio Bill's. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an important member of Frio Bill's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang. That fact, however, was not generally</seg><seg type="columnLine">known, though it was suspected. Arguelles</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been used in the capacity of scout for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the gang, and his visible connection with Frio</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill would have made him persona non grata</seg><seg type="columnLine">in certain quarters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would therefore be a decided pleasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Frio Bill to help hang one of Sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy's friends, and at the same time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who had killed an important member</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bandit gang. Frio Bill would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">killing two birds with one stone. His only</seg><seg type="columnLine">regret was that the sheriff's neck was not in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the noose with Tom Dan ton's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tail on here, men!" he ordered. "There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">some around here ain't afraid to help the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff do his duty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frio Bill set the example and eleven other</seg><seg type="columnLine">pairs of hands seized the free end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope. Sheriff Billy indulged himself in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet chuckle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tom Danton, have you-all anything to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say before you meets yore Gawd?" he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the prisoner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nary a whisper, Billy," answered Dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton with a grin. "Play yore hand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lift him up, men!" cried the sheriff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Pronto!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twelve pairs of boots clawed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground and the rope tautened with a jerk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The next instant a dozen very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonished men went floundering on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces. The rope had parted about half way</seg><seg type="columnLine">between Danton's neck and the limb above,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and save for a moment of pain in the neck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the folded blanket mitigated, Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">Danton was uninjured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps a more astonished crowd never</seg><seg type="columnLine">got together. There were one or two loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughs at the discomfiture of Frio Bill and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Reckon you'll have to git another rope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy," said Danton, rubbing his neck.

As he passed his horse he caught up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coil of rope swinging at his saddle-horn</seg><seg type="columnLine">and proffered it to the sheriff.

Teddy and six seamen were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay aboard the Sham-pan to guard us</seg><seg type="columnLine">five Occidentals. The bulk of the Chinese</seg><seg type="columnLine">were already bobbing up and down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly overcrowded life-boats at distances</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a few hundred yards from the old steamer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain's dingey put off from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship and was rowed rapidly toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">submarine by the four seamen who were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the conspiracy. The bomb lay beneath a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thwart, within easy reach of old Sing Wo</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the stem sheets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Teddy brought sea-glasses for himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">and me, and through a half-shrouded port-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole we watched the progress of Sing Wo's</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate plan to save our gruesome cargo</seg><seg type="columnLine">from desecration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The submarine began to run in rapidly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its gun trained on the dingey.

Sing Wo stood up, dignified</seg><seg type="columnLine">even through the glasses, and shouted be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Velly solly, master, white mans all dead;</seg><seg type="columnLine">me havvee ship paper," I could imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">him calling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a consultation on the conning-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">7"'"* blue, swelling- Mediterranean, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray life-boats gently rising and</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling, filled, with huddled coolies, the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim submarine glistening in the warm sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that frail cockle-shell carrying five Chi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nese on their errand of preposterous brav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery. I had little hope of their success. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that even if they could get alongside</seg><seg type="columnLine">without arousing suspicion the efficacy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crudely made bomb was very doubtful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I wanted to take my eyes from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glasses, but I could not. The lenses were</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderfully strong; even the clear-cut fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures of the U-boat's commander were dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinguishable. He was debonaiply blond</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lean. He seemed so young, such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">handsome boy, that I felt a momentary</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow of pity for him, an insane desire to warn</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. This vanished when his face wrinkled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rage as he shouted an impatient order</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Sing Wo. There was no telling when</seg><seg type="columnLine">an Allied warship might happen along, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Austrian wanted to be done with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">job quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bow oarsmen in the dingey shipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">their oars.

We knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">it clutched the hammer we had seen him</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket. Now, whipping this out, he bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward and struck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing happened.

Where submarine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dingey had been the water was leaping and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashing skyward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The only traces left of these two craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a few splintered fragments which</seg><seg type="columnLine">plopped into the sea about us a few seconds</seg><seg type="columnLine">after Sing Wo blew himself into Buddhahood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       THE lifeboats still afloat saved a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few of the unfortunate coolies from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the capsized boats and returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship while Teddy and I liberated Ben-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son and the two engineers.

Teddy and the quartermaster</seg><seg type="columnLine">were never punished for their part in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">insubordination. Benson, although weak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not a bad sport. His report of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangest mutiny perhaps ever chronicled</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fairly written, and all sorts of posthu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous honors were bestowed on the four</seg><seg type="columnLine">seamen and Sing Wo by the Allied Govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the Chinese, of course, the very word</seg><seg type="columnLine">posthumous is absurd. As the Sham-pan</seg><seg type="columnLine">poked her way to Shanghai over waters ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue and ever smooth, the conduct of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">coolie passengers and crew showed that to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them Sing Wo and the four seamen were</seg><seg type="columnLine">now more alive than ever. Candles burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">for them, it is true, and prayers were said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for them in the gloom below decks around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corpses their bravery had saved for</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper burial. But the way the living</seg><seg type="columnLine">referred to them proved how real to these</seg><seg type="columnLine">coolies was what we Westerners speak of</seg><seg type="columnLine">glibly as the immortality of the soul.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Throughout the rest of that weird voyage</seg><seg type="columnLine">we learned how actual to a Chinese is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oneness of past, present and future, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unity of the dead, the living and the unborn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The self-immolation of Sing Wo and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">four seamen was not a sacrifice of the living</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the dead, as it seemed to us Occidentals.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a sacrifice of men living in one state</seg><seg type="columnLine">for men living in another, a sacrifice which</seg><seg type="columnLine">those Orientals believed had saved the souls</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our coffined fellow voyagers from insult</seg><seg type="columnLine">and degradation unthinkable. And it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a martyrdom which had sent Sing Wo and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the four sailors'--despite the dissolution of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own bodies--on to a plane much</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher than the condition they had known</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This belief in the continuity of exis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tence--so instinctive in Buddhists that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is part of the very breath of the East--</seg><seg type="columnLine">far surpasses in intensity similar convic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions held by any but the most fanatical</seg><seg type="columnLine">Christians. It could never be quite com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehended by lifelong materialists like Ben-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son and me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the other lesson of Sing Wo's heroism</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as clear as the tropical seas which bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">us on to Shanghai. As Dredge Amory had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Courage is mostly a question of what a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man thinks is worth fighting for."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Author of "/I Lcne Hand," "The Man Who Had Only One Ear," etc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE fierce^ African sun, beating on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parched sand drill ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent ripples of waving heat haze</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing away in a fine mirage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The roof of the tin canteen was hot enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fry steak on and inside the air was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">and -blistering.

And more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">once a man went down and didn't rise again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The howling mass of Kaffirs still kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">close around on every side and still the rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of assagais was falling. Gingerly the horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked their way through dead or wounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives, and several times those wounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">men gashed savagely at moving legs as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed over them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right in the gizzard!" the httle Cockney</seg><seg type="columnLine">said grimly as a Kaffir feU and he rammed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his breech block back again. "-! All</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the wye for tuppence!". And then another</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kaffir kicked and sprawled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You seem to like it, Cockney, but it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">no joke," Spring muttered as he hastily</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled his magazine.

Now watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">this bleeder."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A savage head peered round a bush and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cockney's bullet caught it squarely. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kaffir didn't even scream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Free shies a penny!" the little fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">piped. And once again he fired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The backing, pushing horses were near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the foot of the hill. And still the Kaf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">firs dodged from bush to bush and kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">around them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The trouble's coming now, Cockney,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spring cautioned. "We'll have to cross the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open to get high enough to see them."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They'll 'ave to cross the open, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know.

Quickly the Cockney turned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. An assagai was firmly in the horse's</seg><seg type="columnLine">buttocks and trailing out behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Cockney wrenched and. threw it far</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Into the small open space the police were</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossing the Kaffirs madly rushed. Yelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and howling, with stabbing assagais poised,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they bounded in. The police drew their re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volvers, the last backing man turned. To-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether they charged blindly up the rock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strewn hill. -</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And from above a new--a thicker--rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of assagais fell on them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A screaming Kaffir charged the httle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Londoner and hissed. The stab passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmlessly against his saddle and the httle</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's revolver barked. A hiss the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of him and the revolver barked again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then a shield hit up against him flat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shield stayed wedged, the face be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind it glowering. Instantly the httle man</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose in his stirrups and crashed his clenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver butt down on the Kaffir's head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Kaffir howled and jumped away. Ziss!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the assagai stabbed savagely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The frantic horse squealed loudly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swerved on two hind legs. Squealing it</seg><seg type="columnLine">spun completely round. On every side the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cockney were vicious, sweating faces. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursing, howling mouths were everywhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little fellow's revolver went empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at once he clubbed his rifle. A dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">men stabbed at him, but his squealing horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">spun round again. Then helplessly the lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle fellow loosed the reins to use both hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A Kaffir seized the reins, then promptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell with brains all spattered. And another</seg><seg type="columnLine">man grabbed at them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rifle butt fell. And missed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kaffir at the horse's head seized it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked it furiously away. And then--just</seg><seg type="columnLine">then--the Cockney wondered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Furiously the Kaffir brought the rifle up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swung. The frightened horse squealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">madly and sprang into the air. And as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">did a floundering hoof ripped tremblingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">out--and into the Kaffir's chest. Ripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tore down completely through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With agonized screams the horse kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisting round and wildly, hopelessly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">httle Cockney gripped the saddle before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Then of a sudden in crazy, maddened</seg><seg type="columnLine">i5Â§</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">agony the horse charged blindly through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ring of Kaffirs, an assagai, deep in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaming and flapping as it ran.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The horse charged through the Kaffirs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at the Kaffirs. A dozen hands reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the reins but the terrified beast dodged</seg><seg type="columnLine">by them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grimly the little fellow sat as assagais</seg><seg type="columnLine">hissed past him. Grimly he clutched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle and numbly held tight on. His face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was cold, his teeth were clenched, his brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A crowd from out the howling mob</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned with him and, leaping, raced along.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chance assagais still fell and more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">once one grazed against the horse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But panting, charging blindly through</seg><seg type="columnLine">bush and over bristling rocks the frantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast rushed on. Gradually the chasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">men seemed fewer, seemed to get further</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. The sounds of firing soon were get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting far behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly the little Cockney's mind began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work again, his brain faintly to* act. Me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanically the little fellow's hands felt for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reins. And found them cut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shivering, bleeding horse went on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galloped, yet slower and much more shakily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The horse left the bush and charged into</seg><seg type="columnLine">long grass. Charged for a hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">through grass above its back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both fore feet plunged deep down into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden ant bear hole. The horse's brisket</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once more the horse screamed loudly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Cockney turned a somersault and</seg><seg type="columnLine">promptly went to sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little man's eyes opened and he weak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly moved a hand and felt himself. The open</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes saw nothing and he closed them tight</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once more the eyes went open and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">painful puzzlement he rubbed them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rubbed them and still he couldn't see at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all..</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wearily the little fellow stroked his open</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt. Damp all over! Dumbly it flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his muddled brain that it was night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And for a while he lay just as he was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hard, half-whining breath sounded a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few feet away. Wonderingly the little man</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to himself again and listened. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled breathing kept on and he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself over and got on hands and knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With nervous care he crawled the few</seg><seg type="columnLine">long feet to where the breathing seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be. A hand touched something--touched</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sweating skin--and then his throbbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain woke up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poor blighter!" he muttered sorrow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully. "Poor bloomin' pal!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stiffly he leveled himself to his feet, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt along the shivering, quivering horse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still in the buttocks stuck a five-foot stab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing assagai. With teeth set at the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it the little fellow ripped the assagai</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, the weakened horse making but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single fretful whimper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then once again the small man felt along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quivering skin. Whizz! And with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his force he drove the blade in where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">best guessed the heart would be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poor blighter!" he murmured once</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. "You poor old beast."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little man turned round and walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to where he'd lain. Unthinkingly he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on hands and knees and felt ground. Me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanically he felt the sand. Then grass and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thorns and bush. His shaking hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched fretfully at everything in reach.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And still he wasn't satisfied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again he felt around, felt carefully, pains-</seg><seg type="columnLine">takingly and far. And once or twice the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small things which he touched moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little man sat down and for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment thought. Dazedly he reached to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket and produced a box of matches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With deep meditation he counted to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">how many matches he could spare. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the breeze for a short moment died, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the matches one by one and hunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carefully he examined the spot where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fallen. Carefully he inspected the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground beside the horse. Every rock and</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot of sand and towering clump of grass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And all he saw was rock and sand and grass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And that but hazily and dimly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But half a dozen matches still remained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dumbly the little fellow pondered. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sickly feeling he closed the box and pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it back into a pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Roughly he kicked and hit a patch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass down flat, then wearily he lay and</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightened himself out. Weakly, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haustedly, hopelessly he slept and waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the dawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without his glasses!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun was high and blazing when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little man came to himself. Each bone</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed cracking, each muscle stiff and dry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fretfully he reached beside him and felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">his water-bottle. The bottle was half full</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Slamashla Mani</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">159</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and warm. Greedily he drank the best part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it, then struggled to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unthinkingly he shook himself. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bruises from his fall had hardened and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body seemed like one big sore. Dully he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt himself and rubbed himself, then looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the horse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The horse was one great blurr!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For one full minute he stood with eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmly closed. The eyes went open. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">still there was a blurr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little fellow took a couple of shaky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitating steps. The outlines of the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurr moved. Puzzled he stood and closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes once more, then opened them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took another step.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blurr moved. Moved distinctly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he heard it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The watery eyes strained painfully and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he walked on. The blurr moved in a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">places. Moved noisily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anxiously the little fellow halted dead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Halted and listened. Then turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered horrified away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as he staggered more blurrs came</seg><seg type="columnLine">down from out the sky and joined the flock</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gorging vultures on the fresh-killed horse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Cockney swallowed hard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shadows were solid beneath each</seg><seg type="columnLine">bush, the sun directly overhead. Wearily</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little fellow sank beneath a tree and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled the stopper from his water-bottle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greedily he drank the last remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">steaming drop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And for a while he rested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An hour later appraisingly yet dreamily</seg><seg type="columnLine">he inspected himself and counted up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">goods. One clasp knife and still six matches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a wry smile he opened up the tin</seg><seg type="columnLine">opener and corkscrew in the knife, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed them and hung the knife away back</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his belt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And once again he wandered out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The grass was high above his head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly he pushed through it. At first the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalks had cut him, but he'd long since found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stick to use to push a way. And for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour or more without the faintest thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of aim he beat his path along.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The grass grew shorter, then died away</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely. Happily he stepped out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearer sand. Sand with scattered tufts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bush. The weak eyes roved around, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">past the nearest clumps of bush saw noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing but gray smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thoughtfully the little fellow stood and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaged the sun overhead. Smiling he turned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">aside and picked his way in the direction in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he thought his troop had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And still he staggered on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blinding sun poured on him and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fierce hardness of his blind march the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat dripped down in little rivulets. Soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mouth caked with parching thirst, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips went cracked. And then he stood in</seg><seg type="columnLine">dumb dismay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back in his saddle bags were rations!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he had never thought of them!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little fellow laughed. Laughed loud.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thought of them? With that vast horde</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vultures there? And he unarmed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost blind!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Laughing a silly cackle he started on</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Took up the march to nowhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hills closed in and for a while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirted them. Fear that if he climbed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might fall back kept him on level ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dully he kept along the foot of the hills the</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the sun went lower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then he knew that he was circling</seg><seg type="columnLine">round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Uncaringly he turned aside and took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">line away. And steering by the sun he held</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wabbly course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shadows were growing longer. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hour more of light. The little fellow's</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat was aching, his tongue like prickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand. But one more day like this and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must die.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sparse scrub turned to bush, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bush to grass. The dry grass became green.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hopefully the little man pushed on and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dryly licked his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The grass seemed damp, then came a line</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trees. Trees like a line of shimmering</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghosts which reached up to the sky. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cockney's nose worked fast. The Cock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney's weak eyes gleamed. Smiling he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed his way along and through the danc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond a sandy beach, the far side that</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear water. Water that gleamed and glis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened like mirrors in the setting sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Laughing the little man skipped down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tripped across the sand. Two yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead was water. Still, clear, sweet smell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A log lay on the water's edge. The little</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow lifted up a foot to step across it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lifted a foot, found the log too high and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped upon it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gratingly the log moved and commenced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to turn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The stepping foot came back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">i6o</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shivered. Shivered and splashed into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yielding sand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moving log came round, twisted into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half circle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Squealing the little Cockney jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. Sobbing he wildly charged toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the high green grass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And whimpering, blubbering like a httle</seg><seg type="columnLine">child, he tore his maddened course along.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A mile away beneath a tree the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow lay and shivered. The red sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the hill tops, poised for a second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then softly slid away. Ten minutes more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the bright night had fallen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With pounding heart the little man rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet and stared with blinking eyes into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tree above him. Shakily he felt the size</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the trunk and roughness, then reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">above and groped around for limbs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The waving hands gripped at a stunted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken branch and jerkily he raised himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then carefully felt above and all about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The limbs were fairly thick and mostly</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong enough and once more the Cockney</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose another foot or so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the hands went up and tightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped a bough.

His head felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer and he sagged down again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And all that frightful night, wedged</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly up against the tree, the little man</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat firm and listened. Listened with weak</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes staring. And staring eyes quite useless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not twenty feet away a prowling hyena</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted and quietly looked him over. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cockney never knew.

His two</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs locked around the Kaffir's body and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">squirming like a pair of snakes, the strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling men rolled over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gasping for breath the little Cockney</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosed his hold upon the throat and raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hand that held it to try to free himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly the Kaffir drew a rushing, gurg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling breath and made to start to shout.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both hands together pounced upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kaffir's throat and madly tried to pound his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head upon the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And all the time the Kaffir's grip upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the small man's windpipe- was firm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight as though 'twere some machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And once again they rolled, and rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked and jarred with knee to stomach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Kaffir loosed his hold upon an arm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wildly his hand clawed round and sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white man's face.

Many have gathered about it and they are of all classes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and degrees, high and low, rich and poor, adventurers and stay-at-homes, and from all</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts of the earth. Some whose voices we used to know have taken tbe Long Trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">and are heard no more, but they are still memories among us, and new voices are</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard, and welcomed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We are drawn together by a common liking for the strong, clean things of out-of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors, for word from the earth's far places, for man in action instead of caged by cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumstance. The spirit* of adventure lives in all men; the rest is chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But something besides a common interest holds us together. Somehow a real com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">radeship has grown up among us. Men can not thus meet and talk together without</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing into friendlier relations; many a time does one of us come to the rest for facts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and guidance; many a close personal friendship has our Camp-Fire built up between-</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men who had never met; often has it proved an open sesame between strangers</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a far land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Perhaps our Camp-Fire is even a little more. Perhaps it is a bit of leaven working</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently among those of different station toward the fuller and more human understand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and sympathy that will some day bring to man the real democracy and brotherhood</seg><seg type="columnLine">he seeks. Few indeed are the agencies that bring together on a friendly footing so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">and such great extremes as here.

It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first of a series, not all so long as that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of them very short indeed, and run</seg><seg type="columnLine">"every now and then." There have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">several similar articles, by Edgar Young,</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerning Central America. These were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outgrowth of his "A.

Had been going</seg><seg type="columnLine">along satisfied with a few definite facts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a too hazy general conception as to this or</seg><seg type="columnLine">that part of the globe. Just as in the case</seg><seg type="columnLine">of maps--a fellow thinks he has a pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear idea of the map of some place, but let</seg><seg type="columnLine">him try to draw that map even roughly, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">be really definite as to relative locations, etc.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course, in some cases we can muster</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pretty fair knowledge among us--Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anderson, for example, lived years in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Africa, and Mr. Greene also. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world's a large place. Well, we figure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of you are the same kind of critters</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are and that, while some of you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">more geography than we do, there isn't any</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of you who knows it all. Also, we find,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we get right down to it and gather the</seg><seg type="columnLine">facts about some country or locality previ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously hazy in our minds, that we get a whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">lot interested in what we dig up. Here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, we figure you're no different from us</seg><seg type="columnLine">and are likely to be equally interested.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Especially if we do the work for you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">just hand you the dope on a platter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">174</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SO WE'RE going to try it out.

I don't think he's likely to go far</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong in handling the material he under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes, but I can see why they challenged at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least some of the points and this magazine</seg><seg type="columnLine">wants its stories challenged--so long as it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">done pleasantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AN AUTHOR of course has considerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberty in shifting fact material to</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit the purposes of fiction; but it happens</seg><seg type="columnLine">that readers of our magazine have come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect an exceptional degree of historical</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fact accuracy. Most of our writers</seg><seg type="columnLine">give it to them in exceptional degree--</seg><seg type="columnLine">have established a standard, and readers</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally measure all stories by that stan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dard.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pearl Islands, a possession of the Republic</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Panama, are the seat of quite a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearl-fishing industry which is* well organ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before the war a few buyers trom</seg><seg type="columnLine">England, France and Germany circulated</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and down the coast buying whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearls they were able to find in the hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the natives, some of which it is to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared were "held out" on the concession-</seg><seg type="columnLine">holders. As Mr. Wodiska states, all pearls</seg><seg type="columnLine">of round and pear shapes without flaws are</seg><seg type="columnLine">valuable.

The mahog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">any industry is fairly well organized after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">primitive fashion. Local buyers travel from</seg><seg type="columnLine">end to end of the country, and much</seg><seg type="columnLine">mahogany is to be found in almost any of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ports. This wood does not grow in</seg><seg type="columnLine">forests as is popularly supposed, but grows</seg><seg type="columnLine">at random here and there in the jungles, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">great size and peculiar-colored foliage hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing earned for it the title of "king of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forests."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The method used in logging this wood is</seg><seg type="columnLine">as follows: A spy is sent out to climb tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees and search out any mahogany that</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be in the vicinity. Trails are slashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them, and they are marked for cutting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is done at a certain season of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">year according to a local superstition which</seg><seg type="columnLine">forbids cutting them except during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waning of the full moon. This superstition</seg><seg type="columnLine">is perhaps based on the fact that the sap</seg><seg type="columnLine">is less abundant and the wood less likely to</seg><seg type="columnLine">"check" if cut at this tune and may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">foundations in scientific fact. The logs are</seg><seg type="columnLine">hewn square, dragged to the nearest stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">with oxen, and floated to market; or if good</seg><seg type="columnLine">roads are in the vicinity hauled to market</seg><seg type="columnLine">in heavy antiquated ox-carts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many times reports have been current</seg><seg type="columnLine">that all the mahogany in Central America</seg><seg type="columnLine">was exhausted; but a large quantity con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinues to come out each year from all of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">various countries, and recently the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States Government bought up great quan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tities to be exported to this country for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">constructing of aeroplane propellers. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">reports have possibly originated in the erro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neous belief that mahogany is a slow-grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing tree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mahogany has three distinct growths per</seg><seg type="columnLine">year, accounting for the many gi*owth-rings</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown on the logs.

First as to handling furs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  for shipping purposes. I would advise after</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  skinning to stretch the skin as much as you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  possibly can, but be sure it is done smoothly and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  as evenly as possible, and then fasten or nail it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  down, flesh side out. Never rub any alum,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  arsenic or salt on the pelt, as the chemicals they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  contain will injure it and sometimes make it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  absolutely worthless for marketing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    As to the drying: I would suggest that after</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  your skins are properly stretched and nailed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  down, scrape off all the meat and fat with a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  large, dull knife so that you do not cause any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  cuts or damage to the skin, place it in a dry and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  shady place for drying. In a warm climate</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  they should be placed in a cool place out of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  way of bugs or flies (under mosquito-nets).</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Never dry a skin near a fire or in the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Always let them stay on the boards until they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  are dried out fairly stiff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    As to packing: Never fold or crease skins,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  but try to pack them as near flat as you can,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  and when packing try to place fur side to fur</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  side, then paper between where pelt meets pelt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    I know of no books on furs, but can suggest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  the Department of Commerce, Washington,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  D.

With its great diver- v</seg><seg type="columnLine">sity of climate, due to elevations, difference</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rainfall of the two coasts, and prevailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">winds, Central America is rich in natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">flora and fauna, and in opportunities</seg><seg type="columnLine">thereby opened to the merchant.

It appears that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man to be a real naturalist has to have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">httle of the Rip Van Winkle in him--not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sleeping proclivities but the patience</seg><seg type="columnLine">he displayed when hunting and fishing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is said Rip tramped for hours over lonely</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills without so much as sighting a squirrel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sat for hours with a heavy pole without</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting as much as a nibble.

Apples, pears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and peaches act peculiarly at sea-level,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing fruit, flowers, and buds, all at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time; however, in a high altitude they</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall into something like their regular habits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Domestic Animals. The principal do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mestic animals are the dog (canis domesti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cus), goat, cat, ox, ass, and a few mules</seg><seg type="columnLine">and horses of small size. Many wild ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals have been domesticated for household</seg><seg type="columnLine">pets and are prevalent enough to be worthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mention. The principal one is the mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">key, of many varieties; peccary, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">raccoon-like pisote, locally called pizarro</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pizarro solo for the two varieties. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">pets also, the raucous parrot of many sizes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kinds, the macaw, and other forest</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds, are also worthy of note.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wild Animals and Game. The largest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mammals is the tapir, or anta, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">attains a weight of about eight hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds. This animal has a long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">extremely flexible proboscis which is really</seg><seg type="columnLine">an extension of the nose and upper lip form-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a sort of trunk about half as long in</seg><seg type="columnLine">proportion to its size as the trunk of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephant. Its heavy body and short legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not unlike those of a well-fattened hog,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but its skin is soft and covered with a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat of fine hair. Its hoof is composed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">three huge toes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It roams the low, swampy ground after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the manner of the rhinoceros, and is short-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighted to a marked degree similar to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">same animal, but does not submerge itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the water although it frequently</seg><seg type="columnLine">wades and wallows in shallow pools. Upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">being molested it either makes a fast charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the sound and, having missed run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning down the enemy, keeps on going at top</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, or it dashes away in the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The meat of this animal is dtlicious and</seg><seg type="columnLine">highly prized by both natives and foreign-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers, resembling very closely the beef of a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">young steer. For this reason it is locally</seg><seg type="columnLine">called vaca del monte or vac a silvestre, moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain or wild cow, by the natives.

Now to your specific ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1.	I always got water in towns we passed through,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried it in gallon bottles, and never boiled it. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be boiled if taken from country wells or</seg><seg type="columnLine">springs after you get half-way of Georgia. I never</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated water in any way except by boiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 2.	Can't tell you anything about water-bags.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jugs or bottles are O. K.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 3.	You will have to take out non-resident license</seg><seg type="columnLine">for hunting (which comes high everywhere) or else</seg><seg type="columnLine">take a chance. No license necessary for fishing un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less for the market. I always carried a revolver in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car, and was never bothered about it. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">States that have the new Wild-Life Law it is unlaw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful to carry a shotgun or rifle except in the hunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">season; Florida has it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 4.	Not a great deal of danger of the family being</seg><seg type="columnLine">molested in camp, I should say, while you work near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">by towns. Camp close to town, and teach the wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to shoot. Practically no danger at all perhaps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 5.	The roads are usually better in September and</seg><seg type="columnLine">October than at any other time of year. Most roads</seg><seg type="columnLine">off main highways are passable unless very wet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 6.	Employment after you get here? Ordinarily I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should say yes. But as I write this it is probable</seg><seg type="columnLine">that work will be a little scarce. However, "there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a way wherever there's a will." Wages are about</seg><seg type="columnLine">like they are anywhere else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 7.	Don't know a thing about compasses. I al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways used Indian logic in the woods--and a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing is to keep direction in your head, and remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber what you see. I've beat men with compasses</seg><seg type="columnLine">this way. It's nearly always sunshine down here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know, and if you know what time of day it is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what do you need of a compass? The sun's in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">east in the morning and in the west in the after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon, and you can locate certain stars after sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">set, etc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 8.	Any kind of light, water-proof tent is all right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cut out poles and ridge-pole by stringing it on a rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">between trees or between your car and a tree. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">will give you a headlight for light, if the car faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tent. I used to carry a tent that covered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole car and left a space on either side for a folding</seg><seg type="columnLine">Army-type bed; our two children slept in the car</seg><seg type="columnLine">seats. The only objection was that the blamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was too heavy to handle and to carry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 9.	You are not apt to be troubled with anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the shape of insects except mosquitoes, and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">much with these in the Winter. These can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept out by cutting a "window" in either end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent and closing it with mosquito-netting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In case of snake bite, do this: Bind the limb tight</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the wound; cut a cross-mark, as deep as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snake's teeth went, in each little wound; if no abra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions on the lips, suck the wound; then fill the cuts</seg><seg type="columnLine">with moistened crystals of permanganate of potas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sium, and shoot into the surrounding tissue a solu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of this same permanganate with a hypodermic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and release the cording a little to keep the flesh</seg><seg type="columnLine">from "dying." These of course are emergency</seg><seg type="columnLine">measures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A doctor should be had as quickly as possible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the binding of the limb. But you are not at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all apt to be bitten. There are not many poisonous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">snakes down here except in the very wildest places.</seg><seg type="columnLine">See your doctor as to the permanganate solution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 10.	As to medicines, I would take along anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was apt to need. Iodin, aromatic spirits of am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monia, aspirin, something of the nature of sodium</seg><seg type="columnLine">phosphate or sal hepatica, etc., with an emergency</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll of bandage cloth. You're not apt to need the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter-named, but "you never can tell."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As to dehydrated foods, I've never used them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I imagine they'd be all right. You can buy</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything you want in the towns you pass through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 11.	I've never used field-giasses.

The Ama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zons, according to Greek legend, were a race of</seg><seg type="columnLine">women that dwelt in the neighborhood of the Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sea and the Caucasian Mountains. They were sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to compose a state from which men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">excluded and to have devoted themselves to war</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to hunting; and, according to legend, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">often in conflict with the Greeks of the heroic age.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Amazons and their contests and customs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a favorite theme in Grecian art and story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These supposed Amazons were probably nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than priestesses, but they got on the imagina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the Greeks and their followers in culture, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">consequently of the Spaniards and Portuguese.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the Spaniards discovered South America and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the waters of the Amazon, they heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">legend of female warriors, and they applied to them</seg><seg type="columnLine">the name "Amazons," and to the region "Rio de las</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amazonas," or "River of the Amazons."

The reasons are obvious. 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Because of the prohibitive exchange rates, South</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sea islanders have practically stopped buying Amer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ican goods.
