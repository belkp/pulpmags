            <seg type="columnLine">Flinders turned and saw him. He flung</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Don beat him in the face without the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Don was powerless. He felt his senses</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">leaving him again. His blows grew</seg>
