I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know the way good money is made, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm making it. Gone forever are the days</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cheap shoes, cheap _ clothes, walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">home to save carfare, pinching pennies to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make my salary last from one pay-day to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next one. I own one of the finest</seg><seg type="columnLine">Radio stores you ever saw, and I get al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most all the Radio service and repair work</seg><seg type="columnLine">in town.

I was struggling along</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a starvation salary until by accident my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were opened and I saw just what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter with me. Here's the story of</seg><seg type="columnLine">just how it happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the big moments of my life had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come. I had just popped the fatal ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and Louise said, "Yes I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Louise wanted to go in and tell her</seg><seg type="columnLine">father about it right away, so we did. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of grunted when we told him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">news, and asked Louise to leave us alone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, my heart began to sink as I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you and Louise have decided to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">married," he said to me when we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. "Well, Bill, just listen to me. I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched you often here at the house with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louise and I think you are a pretty good,</seg><seg type="columnLine">upstanding young fellow. I knew your</seg><seg type="columnLine">father and mother, and you've always had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good reputation here, too. But just let</seg><seg type="columnLine">me ask you just one question--how much</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you make?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Twenty-eight a week," I told him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't say a word--just wrote it</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on a piece of paper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you any prospects of a better job</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a good raise some time soon ?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, sir; I can't honestly say that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have," I admitted. "I'm looking for some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing better all the time, though."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Looking, eh? How do you go about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, that question stopped me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How did I?

When he saw my</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusion he grunted. "I thought so," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. Then he held up some figures he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">been scribbling at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've just been figuring out your fam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily budget, Bill, for a salary of twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight a week. I've figured it several ways,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so you can take your pick of the one you</seg><seg type="columnLine">like best. Here's Budget No. 1: I figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can afford a very small unfurnished</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment, make your payments on enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain, inexpensive furniture to fix such an</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment up, pay your electricity, gas and</seg><seg type="columnLine">water bills, buy just about one modest out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fit of clothes for both of you once each</seg><seg type="columnLine">year, and save three dollars a week for</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickness, insurance, and emergencies. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can't eat.

And home I went, my mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a whirl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At home I turned the problem over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">over in my mind. I'd popped the question</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Louise on impulse without thinking it</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. Everything Mr. Sullivan had said was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gospel truth. I couldn't see anything to do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">any way to turn.

O'Conor Sloane, Ph.D.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CENTURIES ago, nobody knows how many, the science</seg><seg type="columnLine">of chemistry began in the laboratories of the old alchem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ists. They claimed or hoped that their researches</seg><seg type="columnLine">would ^ bring about the transmutation of metals and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is not the least doubt that in many cases by</seg><seg type="columnLine">concealing gold in a crucible, they persuaded their patrons that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were transforming lead or other inferior substance into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">precious metal. It is probably because this fraud was attempted</seg><seg type="columnLine">so often, that laws were passed against alchemists, prohibiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exercise of their alleged science. Before the age of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alchemists, as it may be termed, the old philosophers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">formulated the conception of the atom, whose name is derived</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Greek and means uncutable or indivisible The so-called</seg><seg type="columnLine">atom in various forms, such as the "atom" of wood or the "atom"</seg><seg type="columnLine">of iron or copper, was taken as being absolutely indestructible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Modern chemistry was born, when it was found that the "atom"</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wood and of all compound substances was quite susceptible</seg><seg type="columnLine">of division.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wood can be divided into carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen. Sugar can be divided into carbon, hydrogen and oxy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gen. Many of the old time atoms proved to be quite divisible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so for compound substances the atom was supplanted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">modern molecule, which is a collection of atoms. A molecule</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sugar, for instance, is built up out of atoms of the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">elements named above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chemists rested very contentedly with this as the basis of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">science. The physicists of the time gave no attention to atoms</seg><seg type="columnLine">or molecules, considering that they belonged entirely to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemists; scientists, physical and chemical, led a quiet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">orderly existence, the chemists developing new compounds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">analyzing old ones and adding to the sum of human knowledge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But physicists after a while began to investigate the atom and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the last few decades the greatest scientific minds of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world have puzzled over what the atom is. They have evolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">the theory that the atom is a highly compound thing; that it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">made up of a combination of positive and negative electricities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each in the form of charges of definite amount. The atom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hydrogen was taken as consisting of one positive and one nega-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive elemental charge of electricity. Going to the other extreme,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the atom of uranium was assigned 238 charges of positive and</seg><seg type="columnLine">92 charges of external or unbound negative electricity. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">negative charges, or the electrons, were taken as having hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">any weight. The atom of uranium weighs about 238 times as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as the atom of hydrogen, and was taken as having that</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of charges of positive electricity in its atom. So we see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what a complicated thing the atom has been theorized as being.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A portion of the negative charges, which were the electrons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to one theory, were supposed to whirl around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">central nucleus, as it is called, which was a mixture of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">positive charges or protons in almost all cases holding bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the nucleus a quantity of stationary electrons. Tnis gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "bound electrons," which were in the nucleus and held fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, and what were called the "planetary electrons," which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling ceaselessly aroundthe nucleus, the nucleus representing</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it were the center of a little planetary system, which had one</seg><seg type="columnLine">essential difference from the solar world, a difference not in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted upon as often as it should have been, to the effect that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planetary electrons whirled around in all sorts of planes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the atom having no representative of the plane of the ecliptic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Other theories rejected the idea of the revolving electrons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is fair to say that man has not the least conception of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what electricity is. So when he builds up his atoms out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric charges, he is reducing the world of matter to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown, just as truly as it was unknown in the days of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Epicurus. The planetary molecule as it was called was the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting conception. But as man is never satisfied with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little he knows and possesses the divinely planted instinct of</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity, he has gone on investigating and is abandoning the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetary atom as it was pictured by Bohr and has substituted</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it the Schrodinger atom. This is the latest product, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">successor of nearly a dozen well-known predecessors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If we go into the theory of physics and chemistry, we will find</seg><seg type="columnLine">that with these great developments of the last few years, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">relatively comfortable old sciences in a sense have disappeared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When we speak of the great authors of Greece and Rome, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">term classics is used. The same term is applied to the physics</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the last generation and they are called the "classic physics."</seg><seg type="columnLine">But while we are straining every nerve to keep up with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">procession, as it may be termed, of modem science, it is a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fort to know that when we are analyzing in the chemical labor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atories or working in mechanics and physics, we can still use</seg><seg type="columnLine">the familiar "classic" sciences of twenty years ago as our tools.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The curious laws and phenomena deduced in modem physics,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction and the change of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass with motion, do not affect us in our lives. This is because</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would not be discernible except in extreme cases. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrestrial velocities and under everyday conditions they and</seg><seg type="columnLine">others also are absolutely imperceptible. The word "phenome-</seg><seg type="columnLine">non" means an appearance; so literally speaking the impressive</seg><seg type="columnLine">and really astonishing things in modern physics and mechanics</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not appear as far as we are concerned--they can only become</seg><seg type="columnLine">'phenomena" or can only "appear" under conditions entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond any obtaining in our everyday life. We need not worry</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the idea that we are shorter in a sleeping car when it is in</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion than when it is at a station; no perceptible or measurable</seg><seg type="columnLine">change can be discerned.

Those phenomena probably depend upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ether, but we know nothing fundamental of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature, nor of that of the ether. Therefore your calcu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lations, comprehensive though they are, cannot predict</seg><seg type="columnLine">the effect upon them of your zone of force. Suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">that that zone actually does set up a barrier in the ether,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that it nullifies gravitation, magnetism, and all allied</seg><seg type="columnLine">phenomena; so that the power-bars, the attractors and</seg><seg type="columnLine">repellers, cannot work through it? Then what? As</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as showing me the zone of force, you might well</seg><seg type="columnLine">have shown me yourself flying off into space, unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">use your power and helpless if you released the zone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No, we must know more of the fundamentals before</seg><seg type="columnLine">you try even a small-scale experiment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, bugs! You're carrying caution to extremes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mart. What can happen? Even if gravitation should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be nullified, I would rise only slowly, heading south</seg><seg type="columnLine">the angle of our latitude--that's thirty-nine degrees--</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the perpendicular. I couldn't shoot off on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangent, as some of these hot-heads have been claiming.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inertia would make me keep pace, approximately, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth in its rotation. I would rise slowly--only as</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast as the tangent departs from the curvature of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's surface. I haven't figured out how fast that is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it must be pretty slow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pretty slow?" Crane smiled. "Figure it out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right--but I'll bet it's slower than the rise of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">toy balloon." Seaton threw down the papers and picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his slide-rule, a twenty-inch trigonometrical duplex.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You'll concede that it is allowable to neglect the radial</seg><seg type="columnLine">component of the orbital velocity of the earth for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">first approximation, won't you--or shall I figure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in too?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You may ignore that factor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right--let's see. Radius of rotation here in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Washington would be cosine latitude times equatorial</seg><seg type="columnLine">radius, approximately--call it thirty-two hundred miles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Angular velocity, fifteen degrees an hour. I want secant</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen less one times thirty-two hundred. Right? Secant</seg><seg type="columnLine">equals one over cosine--um-m-m-m--one point oh three</seg><seg type="columnLine">five. Then point oh three five times thirty-two hundred.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hundred and twelve miles first hour. Velocity constant</seg><seg type="columnLine">with respect to sun, accelerated respecting point of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parture. Ouch! You win, Mart--I'd kinda step out!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, how about this, then? I'll put on a vacuum suit</seg><seg type="columnLine">and carry rations. Harness outside, with the same equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment I used in the test flights before we built Skylark I</seg><seg type="columnLine">--plus the new stuff and a coil. Then throw on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">zone, and see what happens. There can't be any jar</seg><seg type="columnLine">in taking off, and with that outfit I can get back O.K.</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I go clear to Jupiter!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crane sat in silence, his keen mind considering every</seg><seg type="columnLine">aspect of the motions possible, of velocity, of accelera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, of inertia. He already knew well Seaton's resource-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fulness in crises and his physical and mental strength.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As far as I can see, that might be safe," he admitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally, "and we really should know something about it</seg><seg type="columnLine">besides the theory."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine, Mart--let's get busy! I'll be ready in five</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes. Yell for the girls, will you? They'd break</seg><seg type="columnLine">us off at the ankles if we pull anything new without</seg><seg type="columnLine">letting them in on it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few minutes later the "girls" strolled out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crane Field, arms around each other--Dorothy Seaton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her gorgeous auburn hair framing violent eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">vivid coloring; black-haired, dark-eyed Margaret Crane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Br-r-r, it's cold!" Dorothy shivered, wrapping her</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat more closely about her. "This must be the coldest</seg><seg type="columnLine">day Washington has seen for years!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is cold," Margaret agreed. "I wonder what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are going to do out here, this kind of weather?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS SHE spoke, the two men stepped out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"testing shed"--the huge structure that housed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">Osnomian-built space-cruiser, "Skylark II." Seaton</seg><seg type="columnLine">waddled clumsily, wearing as he did a Crane vacuum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit which, built of fur, canvas, metal and transparent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">silica, braced by steel netting and equipped with air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanks and heaters, rendered its wearer independent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside conditions of temperature and pressure. Outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">this suit he wore a heavy harness of leather, buckled</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his body, shoulders, and legs, attached to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were numerous knobs, switches, dials, bakelite cases,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other pieces of apparatus. Carried by a strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">aluminum framework in turn supported by the harness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the universal bearing of a small power-bar rose directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">above his grotesque-looking helmet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you think you're going to do in that thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dickie?" Dorothy called. Then, knowing that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hear her voice, she turned to Crane. "What are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">letting that precious husband of mine do now, Martin?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looks as though he were up to something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While she was speaking, Seaton had snapped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">release of his face-plate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing much, Dottie. Just going to show you-all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the zone of force. Mart wouldn't let me turn it on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">392</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">unless I got all cocked and primed for a year's journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">into space."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dot, what is that zone of force, anyway ?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Margaret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, it's something Dick got into his head during that</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful fight they had on Osnome. He hasn't thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of anything else since we got back. You know how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attractors and repellers work? Well, he found out some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing funny about the way everything acted while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mardonalians were bombarding them with a certain kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a wave-length. He finally figured out the exact ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">that did it, and found out that if it is made strongly</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, it acts as if a repeller and attractor were working</seg><seg type="columnLine">together--only so much stronger that nothing can get</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the boundary, either way--in fact, it's so strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it cuts anything in two that's in the way. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">funny thing is that there's nothing there at all, really;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Dick says that the forces meeting there, or something,</seg><seg type="columnLine">make it act as though something really important were</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. See ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Uh-huh," assented Margaret, doubtfully, just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crane finished the final adjustments and moved toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. A safe distance away from Seaton, he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and waved his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly Seaton disappeared from view, and around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place where he had stood there appeared a shim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mering globe some twenty feet in diameter--a globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently a perfect spherical mirror, which darted</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward and toward the south. After a moment the</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe disappeared and Seaton was again seen. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now standing upon a hemispherical mass of earth. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted back toward the group upon the ground, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mass of earth fell with a crash a quarter of a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. High above their heads the mirror again encom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed Seaton, and again shot upward and southward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Five times this maneuver was repeated before Seaton</seg><seg type="columnLine">came down, landing easily in front of them and opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">his helmet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's just what we thought it was, only worse," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reported tersely. "Can't do a thing with it. Gravitation</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't work through it--bars won't--nothing will. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark? Dark! Folks, you ain't never seen no darkness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor heard no silence. It scared me stiff!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poor little boy--afraid of the dark!" exclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorothy. "We saw absolute blackness in space."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not like this, you didn't. I just saw absolute darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and heard absolute silence for the first time in my life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I never imagined anything like it--come on up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and I'll show it to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No you won't!" his wife shrieked as she retreated</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Crane. "Some other time, perhaps."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seaton removed the harness and glanced at the spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which he had taken off, where now appeared a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hemispherical hole in the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's see what kind of tracks I left, Mart," and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men bent over the depression. They saw with</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishment that the cut surface was perfectly smooth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with not even the slightest roughness or irregularity</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible. Even the smallest loose grains of sand had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheared in two along a mathematically exact hemispheri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal surface by the inconceivable force of the disinte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grating copper bar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, that sure wins the-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An alarm bell sounded. Without a glance around,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seaton seized Dorothy and leaped into the testing shed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dropping her unceremoniously to the floor he stared</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">through the telescope sight of an enormous ray-generator</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had automatically aligned itself upon the distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of liberation of intra-atomic energy which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused the alarm to sound. One hand upon the switch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face was hard and merciless as he waited to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure of the identity of the approaching space-ship, before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he released the frightful power of his generator upon it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've been expecting DuQuesne to try it again," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gritted, striving to make out the visitor, yet more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred miles distant. "He's out to get you, Dot--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this time I'm not just going to warm him up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scare him away, as I did last time. This time that</seg><seg type="columnLine">misguided mutt's going to get frizzled right ... I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">locate him with this small telescope, Mart. Line him</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in the big one and give me the word, will you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I see him, Dick, but it is not DuQuesne's ship. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">built of transparent arenak, like the 'Kondal.' Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it seems impossible, I believe it is the 'Kondal'.'*</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Maybe so, and again maybe DuQuesne built it--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">stole it. Oh second thought, though, I don't believe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">DuQuesne would be fool enough to tackle us again</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the same way--but I'm taking no chances . . . O.K.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is the 'Kondal,' I can see Dunark and Sitar myself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The transparent vessel soon neared the field and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">four Terrestrials walked out to greet their Osnomian</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends. Through the arenak walls they recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dunark, Kofedix of Kondal, at the controls, and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sitar, his beautiful young queen, lying in one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seats near the wall. She attempted a friendly greeting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but her face was strained as though she were laboring</seg><seg type="columnLine">under a burden too great for her to bear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they watched, Dunark slipped a helmet over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and one over Sitar's, pressed a button to open</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the doors, and supported her toward the opening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They musn't come out, Dick!" exclaimed Dorothy</seg><seg type="columnLine">in dismay. "They'll freeze to death in five minutes with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out any clothes on!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, and Sitar can't stand up under our gravitation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">either--I doubt if Dunark can, for long," and Seaton</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashed toward the vessel, motioning the visitor back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But misunderstanding the signal, Dunark came on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he clambered heavily through the door he staggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though under an enormous weight, and Sitar col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapsed upon the frozen ground. Trying to help her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-kneeling over her, Dunark struggled, his green skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">paling to a yellowish tinge at the touch of the bitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unexpected cold. Seaton leaped forward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered Sitar up in his mighty arms as though she</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Help Dunark back in, Mart," he directed crisply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hop in, girls--we've got to take these folks back up</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they can live."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seaton shut the door, and as everyone lay flat in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seats Crane, who had taken the controls, applied</seg><seg type="columnLine">one notch of power and the huge vessel leaped upward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miles of altitude were gained before Crane brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cruiser to a stop and locked her in place with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">anchoring attractor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There," he remarked calmly, "gravitation here is</seg><seg type="columnLine">approximately the same as it is upon Osnome."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," put in Seaton, standing up and shedding cloth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in all directions, "and I rise to remark that we'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">better undress as far as the law allows--perhaps farther.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I never did like Osnomian ideas of comfortable warmth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but we can endure it by peeling down to bedrock----"</seg><seg type="columnLine">SKYLARK THREE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">393</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SITAR jumped up happily, completely restored, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three women threw their arms around each other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What a horrible, terrible, frightful world!" ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed Sitar, her eyes widening as she thought of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">first experience with our earth. "Much as I love you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shall never dare try to visit you again. I have never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been able to understand why you Terrestrials wear what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you call 'clothes/ nor why you are so terribly, brutally</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong. Now I really know--I will feel the utterly cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">and savage embrace of that awful earth of yours as</seg><seg type="columnLine">long as I live!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, it's not so bad, Sitar." Seaton, who was shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">both of Dunark's hands vigorously, assured her over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulder. "All depends on where you were raised.</seg><seg type="columnLine">[We like it that way, and Osnome gives us the pip. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">you poor fish," turning again to Dunark, "with all my</seg><seg type="columnLine">brains inside your skull, you should have known what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were letting yourself in for."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's true, after a fashion," Dunark admitted, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">your brain told me that Washington was hot. If I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">have thought to recalculate your actual Fahrenheit de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grees into our loro . . . but that figures only forty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven and, while very cold, we could have endured it</seg><seg type="columnLine">--wait a minute, I'm getting it. You have what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">call'seasons.' This, then, must be your'winter.' Right?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Right the first time. That's the way your brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">works behind my pan, too. I could figure anything out</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right after it happened, but hardly ever beforehand</seg><seg type="columnLine">--so I guess I can't blame you much, at that. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I want to know is, how'd you get here ? It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take more than my brains--you can't see our sun from</seg><seg type="columnLine">anywhere near Osnome, even if you knew exactly where</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Easy. Remember those wrecked instruments you</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw out of Skylark I when we built Skylark IIf"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Having every minute detail of the configuration of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seaton's brain engraved upon his own, Dunark spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">English in Seaton's own characteristic careless fashion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only when thinking deeply or discussing abstruse matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">did Seaton employ the carefully selected and precise</seg><seg type="columnLine">phrasing, which he knew so well how to use. "Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of them was beyond repair and the juice was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">on most of them. One was an object-compass bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Earth. We simply fixed the bearings, put on</seg><seg type="columnLine">some minor improvements, and here we are."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us all sit down and be comfortable," he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued, changing into the Kondalian tongue without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">break, "and I will explain why we have come. We are</seg><seg type="columnLine">in most desperate need of two things which you alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">can supply--salt, and that strange metal, 'X'. Salt I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know you have in great abundance, but I know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have very little of the metal. You have only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one compass upon that planet?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's all--one is all we set on it. However, we've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got close to half a ton of the metal on hand--you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">have all you want."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Even if I took it all, which I would not like to do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would be less than half enough. We must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least one of your tons, and two tons would be better."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Two tons! Holy cat! Are you going to plate a fleet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of battle cruisers?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "More than that.

"Shortly after you left Osnome</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">we were invaded by the inhabitants of the third planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our fourteenth sun. Luckily for us they landed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mardonale, and in less than two days there was not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single Osnomian left alive upon that half of the planet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They wiped out our grand fleet in one brief engagement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was only the Kondal and a few more like her</seg><seg type="columnLine">that enabled us to keep them from crossing the ocean.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even with our full force of these vessels, we cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">defeat them. Our regular Kondalian weapons were use-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less. We shot explosive copper charges against them</seg><seg type="columnLine">of such size as to cause earthquakes all over Osnome,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without seriously crippling their defenses. Their offen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive weapons are almost irresistible--they have genera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors that burn arenak as though it were so much paper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a series of deadly frequencies against which only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a copper-driven ray screen is effective, and even that</seg><seg type="columnLine">does not stand up long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How come you lasted till now, then ?" asked Seaton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They have nothing like the Skylark, and no knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of intra-atomic energy. Therefore their space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships are of the rocket type, and for that reason they</seg><seg type="columnLine">can cross only at the exact time of conjunction, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever you call it--no, not conjunction, exactly, either,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since the two planets do not revolve around the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun: but when they are closest together. Our solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">system is so complex, you know, that unless the trips</seg><seg type="columnLine">are timed exactly, to the hour, the vessels will not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to land upon Osnome, but will be drawn aside and</seg><seg type="columnLine">be lost, if not actually drawn into the vast central sun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Although it may not have occurred to you, a little reflec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion will show that the inhabitants of all the central</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets, such as Osnome, must perforce be absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignorant of astronomy, and of all the wonders of outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">space. Before your coming we knew nothing beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own solar system, and very little of that. We knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the existence of only such of the closest planets as</seg><seg type="columnLine">were brilliant enough to be seen in our continuous sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, and they were few. Immediately after your coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gave your knowledge of astronomy to a group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our foremost physicists and mathematicians, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been working ceaselessly from space-ships--close</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough so that observations could be recalculated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Osnome, and yet far enough away to afford perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">'seeing,' as you call it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I don't know any more about astronomy than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pig does about Sunday," protested Seaton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your knowledge of details is, of course, incomplete,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceded Dunark, "but the detailed knowledge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best of your Earthly astronomers would not help us a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great deal, since we are so far removed from you in</seg><seg type="columnLine">space. You, however, have a very clear and solid knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the fundamentals of the science, and that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">what we need, above all things."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, maybe you're right, at that.

"That-conjunction shall never</seg><seg type="columnLine">occur. That is why I must have the vast quantities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">salt and 'X'. We are building abutments of arenak</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the first satellite of our seventh planet, and upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">our sixth planet itself.

We have cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culated the exact times, places, and magnitudes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces to be used. We shall throw the sixth planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">some distance out of its orbit, and force the first satellite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the seventh planet clear out of that planet's influence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The two bodies whose motions we have thus changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">will collide in such a way that the resultant body will</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet the planet of our enemies in head-on collision, long</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the next conjunction. The two bodies will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">of almost equal masses, and will have opposite and</seg><seg type="columnLine">approximately equal velocities; hence the resultant fused</seg><seg type="columnLine">or gaseous mass will be practically without velocity</seg><seg type="columnLine">and will fall directly into the fourteenth sun."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wouldn't it be easier to destroy it with an explosive</seg><seg type="columnLine">copper bomb?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Easier, yes, but much more dangerous to the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our solar system.

The way we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">in mind will simply allow the planet and one satellite</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drop out quietly--the other planets of the same sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">will soon adjust themselves to the new conditions, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the system at large will be practically unaffected--at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least, so we believe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seaton's eyes narrowed as his thoughts turned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quantities of copper and "X" required and to the engi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neering features of the project; Crane's first thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">was of the mathematics involved in a computation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that magnitude and character; Dorothy's quick reaction</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one of pure horror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He can't, Dick! He mustn't! It would be too ghastly!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's outrageous--it's unthinkable--it's--it's--it's simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">too horrible!" Her violet eyes flamed, and Margaret</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined in f</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">-	"That would be awful, Martin.

What do you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">think Dunark is up against? Sherman chirped it when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he described war--and this is a real he-war; a brand</seg><seg type="columnLine">totally unknown on our Earth.

One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them's got to go. Remember those folks go into a war</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly, and there isn't a thought, even remotely</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembling our conception of mercy in any of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds on either side. If Dunark's plans go through, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy nation will be wiped out. That is horrible, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course. But on the ojther hand, if we block him off from</seg><seg type="columnLine">salt and 'X,' the entire Kondalian nation will be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed just as thoroughly and efficiently, and even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">horribly--not one man, woman, or child would be spared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Which nation do you want saved? Play that over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple of times on your adding machine, Dot, and let</seg><seg type="columnLine">me know what you get."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorothy, taken aback, opened and closed her moutK</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice before she found her voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, Dick, they couldn't possibly.

But say, Mart, while I think of it, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">mustn't forget to install a zone-of-force apparatus on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this boat, too. Even though we can't use it intelligently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it certainly would be a winner as a defense. We couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt anybody through it, of course, but if we should</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen to be getting licked anywhere, all we'd have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do would be to wrap ourselves up in it.

Nothing in the ether spectrum is corkscrewy</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to get through it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's the second idea you've had since I've known</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Dicky," Dorothy smiled at Crane.

What about those instruments?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE three men gathered around the instrument-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board and Dunark explained the changes he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made--and to such men as Seaton and Crane it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon evident that they were examining an installation</seg><seg type="columnLine">embodying sheer perfection of instrumental control--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">system which only those wonder instrument-makers, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Osnomians, could have devised. The new object-com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">passes were housed in arenak cases after setting, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the housings were then exhausted to the highest attain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able vacuum. Oscillation was set up by means of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully standardized electrical impulse, instead of by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clumsy finger-touch Seaton had used. The bearings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">built of arenak and Osnomian jewels, were as strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the axles of a truck and yet were almost perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">frictionless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I like them myself," admitted Dunark. "Without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">load the needles will rotate freely more than a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours on the primary impulse, as against a few minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the old type; and under load they are many thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of times as sensitive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a blinding flash and a deafening report, ace!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">declared Seaton, enthusiastically.

Dun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ark had adopted the Perkins telephone system, but had</seg><seg type="columnLine">improved it until it was scarcely recognized and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it capable of almost unlimited range. Even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns--heavy rapid-firers, mounted in spherical bearings</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the walls--were aimed and fired by remote control,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the board. He had devised full automatic steer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing controls; and meters and recorders for acceleration,</seg><seg type="columnLine">velocity, distance, and flight-angle. He had perfected a</seg><seg type="columnLine">system of periscopic vision, which enabled the pilot to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">see the entire outside surfaces of the shell, and to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward any point of the heavens without interference.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This kind of takes my eye, too, prince," Seaton said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he seated himself, swung a large, concave disk in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of him, and experimented with levers and dials.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You certainly can't call this thing a periscope--it's no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more a periscope than I am a polyp. When you look</seg><seg type="columnLine">through this plate, it's better than looking out of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">window--it subtends more than the angle of vision, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you can't see anything but out-of-doors--I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a second I was going to fall out. What do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">call 'em, Dunark?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kraloto. That would be in English ...

"The refracting system</seg><seg type="columnLine">is invisible--it seems as though nothing intervenes be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the eye and the object. You perfected all these</seg><seg type="columnLine">things since we left Osnome, Dunark? You are in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">class by yourself. I could not even copy them in less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a month, and I never could have invented them."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I did not do it alone, by any means.

One of their slugs struck directly in front of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">left eye--it was kinda funny, at that, seeing it splash</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and I thought I was inside a boiler in a riveting</seg><seg type="columnLine">shop when those machine-guns cut loose. It was hectic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right, while it lasted. But one thing I'll tell the atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive world--we're not doing all the worrying. Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">few, if any, of the gangsters they send after us are</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting back.

And</seg><seg type="columnLine">this constant menace of losing Dorothy, if I let her out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my sight for five seconds, is driving me mad. To tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you the real truth, I'm devilishly afraid that they'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure out something that'll work. I could grab off two</seg><seg type="columnLine">women, or kill two men, if they had armor and guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to stock a war. I believe that DuQuesne could,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too--and the rest of that bunch aren't imbeciles, either,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by any means. I won't feel safe until all four-of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">are in the Skylark and a long ways from here. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure glad we're pulling out; and I don't intend to come</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">back until I get a good line on DuQuesne. He's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird I'm going to get, and get right--and when I get</seg><seg type="columnLine">him I'll tell the cock-eyed world he'll stay got.

Margaret was working upon a bit of em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">broidery. Dorothy, seated upon a cushion on the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one foot tucked under her, was reading, her hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">straying from time to time to a box of chocolates con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veniently near.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, this is a peaceful, home-like scene--too bad to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bust it up.

Instantly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">needle began to revolve, and for many minutes there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no apparent change in its motion in either the primary or</seg><seg type="columnLine">secondary bearings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you suppose it is out of order, after all ?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crane, regretfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*J.

''You see, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">weren't designed to indicate such distances on such small</seg><seg type="columnLine">objects as men, so I threw a million ohms in series with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impulse. That cuts down the free rotation to less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than half an hour, and increases the sensitivity to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">limit. There, isn't she trying to quit it ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, it is settling down. It must be on him still."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally the ultra-sensitive needle came to rest. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had done so, Seaton calculated the distance, read the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction, and made a reading upon Osnome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's there, all right. Bearings agree, and distances</seg><seg type="columnLine">check to within a light-year, which is as close as we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope to check on as small a mass as a man.

"He's just</seg><seg type="columnLine">too perfect, the way he is.

So long, folks, I'm going</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the shop."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DAY after day the Skylark plunged through the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">emptiness of the interstellar reaches. At the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of each second she was traveling exactly twenty-six feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">per second faster than she had been at its beginning; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as day after day passed, her velocity mounted into figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">which became meaningless, even when expressed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of miles per second. Still she seemed sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionary to her occupants, and only different from a vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless upon the surface of the Earth in that objects</seg><seg type="columnLine">within her hull had lost three-sixteenths of their normal</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight. Acceleration,. too, had its effect. Only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidity with Which the closer suns and their planets were</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed gave any indication of the frightful speed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they were being hurtled along by the inconceivable</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of that disintegrating copper bar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the vessel was nearly half-way to "X," the bar</seg><seg type="columnLine">was reversed in order to change the sign of their accelera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and the hollow sphere spun through an angle of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and eighty degrees around the motionless cage</seg><seg type="columnLine">which housed the enormous gyroscopes. Still apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless and exactly as she had been before, the Sky-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lark was now actually traveling in a direction which</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed "down" and with a velocity which was being con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly decreased by the amount of their negative ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">celeration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few days after the bar had been reversed Seaton</seg><seg type="columnLine">announced that the mechanical educator was complete,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brought it into the control room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In appearance it was not unlike a large radio set, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was infinitely more complex. It possessed numerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes, kino-lamps, and photo-electric cells, as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">many coils of peculiar design--there were dozens of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dials and knobs, and a multiple set of head-harnesses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How can a thing like that possibly work as it does ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Crane. "I know that it does work, but I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely believe it, even after it had educated me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is nothing like the one Dunark used, Dick," ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected Dorothy. "How ccme ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll answer you first, Dot. This is an improved</seg><seg type="columnLine">model--it has quite a few gadgets of my own in it. Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mart, as to how it works--it isn't so funny after you</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand it--it's a lot like radio in that respect. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">operates on a band of frequencies lying between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">longest light and heat waves and the shortest radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves. This thing here is the generator of those waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a very heavy power amplifier. The headsets are</seg><seg type="columnLine">stereoscopic transmitters, taking or receiving a three-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensional view. Nearly all matter is transparent to</seg><seg type="columnLine">those waves; for instance bones, hair, and so on. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, cerebin, a cerebroside peculiar to the thinking struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of the brain, is opaque to them. Dunark, not know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing chemistry, didn't know why the educator worked or</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it worked on--he found out by experiment that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">did work; just as we found out about electricity. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">three-dimensional model, or view, or whatever you want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to call it, is converted into electricity in the headsets, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the resulting modulated wave goes back to the educator.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There it is heterodyned with another wave--this second</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequency was found after thousands of trials and is, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe, the exact frequency existing in the optic nerves</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves--and sent to the receiving headset. Modu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated as it is, and producing a three-dimensional picture,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after rectification in the receiver, it reproduces exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">what has been 'viewed,' if due allowance has been made</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the size and configuration of the different brains in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volved in the transfer. You remember a sort of flash--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">SKYLARK THREE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">401</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sensation of seeing something--when the educator</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked on you? Well, you did see it, just as though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been transmitted to the brain by the optic nerve, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything came at once, so the impression of sight was</seg><seg type="columnLine">confused. The result in the brain, however, was clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and permanent. The only drawback is that you haven't</seg><seg type="columnLine">the visual memory of what you have learned, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes makes it hard to use your knowledge. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know whether you know anything about a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject or not until after you go digging around in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain looking for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see," said Crane, and Dorothy, the irrepressible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">putin: .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just as clear as so much mud. What are the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">provements you added to the original design?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you see, I had a big advantage in knowing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerebrin was the substance involved, and with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge I could carry matters considerably farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">than Dunark could in his original model. I can transfer</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thoughts of somebody else to a third party or to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">record. Dunark's machine couldn't work against resist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance--if the subject wasn't willing to give up his thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">he couldn't get them. This one can take them away by</seg><seg type="columnLine">force. In fact, by increasing plate and grid voltages in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amplifier, I can pretty nearly burn out a man's brain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yesterday, I was playing with it, transferring a section of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own brain to a magnetized tape--for a permanent</seg><seg type="columnLine">record, you know--and found out that above certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather low voltages it becomes a form of torture that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would make the best efforts of the old Inquisition seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a petting party."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you succeed in the transfer ?" Crane was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensely interested.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure. .. Push the button for Shiro, and we'll start</seg><seg type="columnLine">something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put your heads against this screen," he directed when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shiro had come in, smiling and bowing as usual. "I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to caliper your brains to do a good job."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The calipering done, he adjusted various dials and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamped the electrodes over his own head and over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads of Crane and Shiro.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Want to learn Japanese while we're at it, Mart?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm going to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes, please. I tried to learn it while I was in Japan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was altogether too difficult to be worth while."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seaton threw in a switch, opened it, depressed two</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, opened them, and threw off the power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All set," he reported crisply, and barked a series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive syllables at Shiro, ending upon a rising note.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir," answered the Japanese.

"Great Cat! That's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">purely Osnomian war-gadget--kind of a battleship de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tector--shows that there's a boatload of bad news around</seg><seg type="columnLine">here somewhere. Grab the visiplates quick, folks," as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rang Shiro's bell. "I'll take visiplate area one, dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead. Mart, take number two.

See</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything, any of you ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NONE of them could discover anything amiss, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the purple light continued to flash, and the bell to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring. Seaton cut off the bell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're almost to 'X'," he thought aloud. "Can't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a million miles or so, and we're almost stopped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wonder if somebody's there ahead of us? Maybe Dun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ark is doing this, though. I'll call him and see." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw in a switch and said one word--"Dunark!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Here!" came the voice of the Kofedix from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaker. "Are you generating?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No--just called to see if you were. What do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">make of it ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing as yet. Better close up?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, edge over this way and I'll come over to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Leave your negative as it is--we'll be stopped di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectly. Whatever it is, it's dead ahead. It's a long ways</seg><seg type="columnLine">off yet, but we'd- better get organized. Wouldn't talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">much, either--they may intercept our wave, narrow as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better yet, shut off your radio entirely. When we</seg><seg type="columnLine">get close enough together, we'll use the hand-language.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You may not know that you know it, but you do. Turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">your heaviest searchlight toward me--I'll do the same."</seg><seg type="columnLine">. There was a click as Dunark's power was shut off</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly, and Seaton grinned as he cut his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right, too, folks. In Osnomian battles we al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways used a sign-language when we couldn't hear any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing--and that was most of the time. I know it as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I know English, now that I am reminded of the fact."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He shifted his course to intercept that of the Osnomian</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel. After a time the watchers picked out a minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of light, moving comparatively rapidly against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars, and knew it to be the searchlight of the Kondal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Soon the two vessels were almost side by side, moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously forward, and Seaton set up a sixty-inch para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolic reflector, focused upon a coil.

He studied meters</seg><seg type="columnLine">and adjusted dials. "Set on nineteen hours forty-three</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, and two hundred seventy-one degrees.

Better</seg><seg type="columnLine">strap yourselves in solid, folks--this may develop into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of rough party, by the looks of things right now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS he spoke, a pyrotechnic display enveloped the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire ship as a radiation from the foreign vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the other neutralizing screen and dissipated its</seg><seg type="columnLine">force harmlessly in the ether. Instantly Seaton threw on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the full power of his refrigerating system and shot in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the master switch that actuated the complex offensive</seg><seg type="columnLine">armament of his dreadnought of the skies. An intense,</seg><seg type="columnLine">livid violet glow hid completely main and auxiliary power</seg><seg type="columnLine">bars, and long flashes leaped between metallic objects in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all parts of the vessel. The passengers felt each hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">striving to stand on end as the very air became more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more highly charged--and this was but the slight corona-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loss of the frightful stream of destruction being hurled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other space-cruiser, now scarcely a mile away!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seaton stared into number one visiplate, manipulating</seg><seg type="columnLine">levers and dials as he drove the Skylark hither and yon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodging frantically, the while the automatic focusing de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vices remained centered upon the enemy and the enor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous generators continued to pour forth their deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequencies. The bars glowed more fiercely as they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced to full working load--the stranger was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">blaze of incandescent ionization, but she still fought on;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Seaton noticed that the pyrometers recording the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperature of the shell were mounting rapidly, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of the refrigerators.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dunark, put everything you've got upon one spot--</seg><seg type="columnLine">right on the end of his nose!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the first shell struck the mark, Seaton concentrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">every force at his command upon the designated point.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The air in the Skylark crackled and hissed and intense</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet flames leaped from the bars as they were driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost to the point of disruption. 'From the forward end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the strange craft there erupted prominence after</seg><seg type="columnLine">prominence of searing, unbearable flame as the terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">charges of explosive copper struck the mark and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploded, liberating instantaneously their millions upon mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions of kilowatt-hours of intra-atomic energy. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">prominence enveloped all three of the fighting vessels</seg><seg type="columnLine">and extended for hundreds of miles out into space--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">still the enemy warship continued to hurl forth solid and</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibratory destruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A brilliant orange light flared upon the panel, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seaton gasped as he swung his visiplate upon his de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fenses, which he had supposed impregnable. His outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen was already down, although its mighty copper</seg><seg type="columnLine">generator was exerting its utmost power. Black areas</seg><seg type="columnLine">had already appeared and were spreading rapidly, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">there should have been only incandescent radiance; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inner screen was even now radiating far into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultra-violet and was certainly doomed. Knowing as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did the stupendous power driving those screens, he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there were superhuman and inconceivable forces be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing directed against them, and his right hand flashed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the switch controlling the zone of force. Fast as he was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">much happened in the mere moment that passed before</seg><seg type="columnLine">his flying hand could close the switch. In the last in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">finitesimal instant of time before the zone closed in, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaping black hole appeared in the incandescence of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inner screen, and a small portion of a ray of energy so</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupendous as to be palpable, struck, like a tangible</seg><seg type="columnLine">projectile, the exposed flank of the Skylark. Instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the refractory arenak turned an intense, dazzling white</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more than a foot of the forty-erght-inch skin of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel melted away, like snow before an oxy-acetylene</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame: melting and flying away in molten globes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparkling gases--the refrigerating coils lining the hull</seg><seg type="columnLine">were of no avail against the concentrated energy of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">titanic thrust. As Seaton shut off his power, intense</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness and utter silence closed in, and he snapped on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They take one trick!" he blazed, his eyes almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">emitting sparks, and leaped for the generators. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten the efforts of the zone of force,'however, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">only sprawled grotesquely in the air until he floated</seg><seg type="columnLine">within reach of a line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold everything, Dick!" Crane snapped, as Seaton</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent over one of the bars. "What are you going to do ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going to put as heavy bars in these ray-genera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors as they'll stand and go out and get that bird. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't lick him with Osnomian rays or with our explosive</seg><seg type="columnLine">copper, but I can carve that sausage into slices with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">zone of force, and I'm going to do it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Steady, old man--take it easy. I see your point,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but remember that you must release the zone of force be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore you can use it as a weapon. Furthermore, you must</seg><seg type="columnLine">discover his exact location, and must get close enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to use the zone as a weapon, all without its protec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Can those ray-screens be made sufficiently power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful to withstand the beam they employed last, even for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hm ... m ... m. Never thought of that, Mart,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">SKYLARK THREE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">403</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Seaton replied, the fire dying out of his eyes. "Wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">how long the battle lasted?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eight and two-tenths seconds, from first to last, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had had that heavy ray in action only a fraction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one second when you cut in the zone of force. Either</seg><seg type="columnLine">they underestimated our strength at first, or else it re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired about eight seconds to tune in their heavy genera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors--probably the former."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But we've got to do something, man! We can't just</seg><seg type="columnLine">sit here and twiddle our thumbs!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, and why not? That course seems eminently</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise and proper. In fact, at the present time, thumb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fwiddling is distinctly indicated."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, you're full of little red ants! We can't do a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing with that zone on--and you say just sit here. Sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose they know all about that zone of force? Suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">they can crack it ? Suppose they ram us ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shall take up your objections in order," Crane had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted a cigarette and was smoking meditatively. "First,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they may or may not know about it. At present, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">point is immaterial. Second, whether or not they know</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it, it is almost a certainty that they cannot crack</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. It had been up for more than three minutes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have undoubtedly concentrated everything possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon us during that time. It is still standing. I really</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected it to go down in the first few seconds, but now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it has held this long it will, in all probability, continue</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold indefinitely. Third, they most certainly will not</seg><seg type="columnLine">ram us, for several reasons. They probably have en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countered few, if any, foreign vessels able to stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">against them for a minute, and will act accordingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, too, it is probably safe to assume that their vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">is damaged, to some slight extent at least; for I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe that any possible armament could withstand the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces you directed against them and escape entirely un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scathed. Finally, if they did ram us, what would hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pen? Would we feel the shock? That barrier in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ether seems impervious, and if so, it could not transmit</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blow. I do not see exactly how it would affect the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship dealing the blow. You are the one who works out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new problems in unexplored mathematics--some time</seg><seg type="columnLine">you must take a few months off and work it out."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, it would take that long, too, I guess--but you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, he can't hurt us. That's using the old bean, Mart!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was going off half-cocked again, darn it! I'll pipe</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, and we'll go into a huddle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">O	EATON noticed that Dorothy's face was white and</seg><seg type="columnLine">^ that she was fighting for self-control. Drawing him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self over to her, he picked her up in a tight embrace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cheer up, Red-Top! This man's war ain't started</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not started ? What do you mean ? Haven't you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin just been admitting to each other that you can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">do anything ? Doesn't that mean that we are beaten ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Beaten! Us? How do you get that way? Noton</seg><seg type="columnLine">your sweet young life!" he ejaculated, and the surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his face was so manifest that she recovered in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly. "We've just dug a hole and pulled the hole in</seg><seg type="columnLine">after us, that's all! When we get everything doped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to suit us, we'll snap out of it and that bird'll think he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">been petting a wildcat!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mart, you re the thinking end of this partnership,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he continued, thoughtfully. "You've got the analytical</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind and the judicial disposition, and can think circles</seg><seg type="columnLine">around me. From what little you've seen of those folks,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me who, what, and where they are. I'm getting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">germ of an idea, and maybe we can make it work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will try it." Crane paused. "They are, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither from the Earth nor from Osnome. It is also</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident that they have solved the secret of intra-atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy. Their vessels are not propelled as ours are--they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have so perfected that force that it acts upon every</seg><seg type="columnLine">particle of the structure and its contents. . . . "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you figure that?" blurted Seaton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because of the acceleration they can stand. Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">even semi-human, and probably nothing living, could en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dure it otherwise. Right?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes--I never thought of that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Furthermore, they are far from home, for if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were from anywhere nearby, the Osnomians would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">known of them--particularly since it is evident from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">size of the vessel that it is not a recent development with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, as it is with us. Since the green system is close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the Galaxy, it seems reasonable, as a work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hypothesis, to assume that they are from some system</seg><seg type="columnLine">far from the center, perhaps close to the outer edge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They are very evidently of a high degree of intelligence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They are also highly treacherous and merciless... ."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why?" asked Dorothy, who was listening eagerly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I deduce those characteristics from their unprovoked</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack upon peaceful ships, vastly smaller and sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posedly of inferior armament; and also from the nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that attack. This vessel is probably a scout or an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploring ship, since it seems to be alone. It is not alto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether beyond the bounds of reason to imagine it upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">voyage of discovery, in search of new planets to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">subjugated and colonized. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's a sweet picture of our future neighbors--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I guess you're hitting the old nail on the head, at that."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If these deductions are anywhere nearly correct,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are terrible neighbors. For my next point, are we</seg><seg type="columnLine">justified in assuming that they do or do not know about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the zone of force?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's a hard one. Knowing what they evidently do</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, it's hard to see how they could have missed it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And yet, if they had known about it for a long time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't they be able to get through it? Of course it</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be a real and total barrier in the ether--in that case</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'd know that they couldn't do a thing as long as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep it on. Take your choice, but I believe that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">know about it, and know more than we do--that it is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">total barrier set up in the ether."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I agree with you, and we shall proceed upon that</seg><seg type="columnLine">assumption. They know, then, that neither they nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can do anything as long as we maintain the zone--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it is a stalemate. They also know that it takes an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous amount of power to keep the zone in place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now we have gone as far as we can go upon the meager</seg><seg type="columnLine">data we have--considerably farther than we really are</seg><seg type="columnLine">justified in going. We must now try to come to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">conclusion concerning their present activities. If our</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideas as to their natures are even approximately correct,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are waiting, probably fairly close at hand, until we</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall be compelled to release the zone, no matter how</seg><seg type="columnLine">long that period of waiting shall be. They know, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, from our small size, that we cannot carry enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">copper to maintain it indefinitely, as the)r could. Does</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sound reasonable?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I check you to nineteen decimal places, Mart, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from your ideas I'm getting surer and surer that we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull their corks. I can get into action in a hurry when</seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I have to, and my idea now is to wait until they relax a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trifle, and then slip a fast one over on them. One more</seg><seg type="columnLine">bubble out of the old think-tank and I'll let you off for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day. At what time will their vigilance be at lowest</seg><seg type="columnLine">ebb? That's a poser, I'll admit, but the answer to it</seg><seg type="columnLine">may answer everything--the first shot will, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the best chance we'll ever have."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, we should succeed in the first attempt. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have very little information to guide us in answering</seg><seg type="columnLine">that question." He studied the problem for many</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes before he resumed, "I should say that for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time they would keep all their rays and other weapons</seg><seg type="columnLine">in action against the zone of force, expecting us to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lease it immediately. Then, knowing that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasting power uselessly, they would cease attacking, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be very watchful, with every eye fastened upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">us and with every weapon ready for instant use. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">this period of vigilance, regular ship's routine would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">resumed. Half the force, probably, would go off duty--</seg><seg type="columnLine">for, if they are even remotely like any organic beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which we are familiar, they require sleep or its</seg><seg type="columnLine">equivalent at intervals. The men on duty--the normal</seg><seg type="columnLine">force, that is--would be doubly careful for a time. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">habit will assert itself, if we have done nothing to create</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicion, and their watchfulness will relax to the point</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ordinary careful observation. Toward the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their watch, because of the strain of the battle and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of the unusually long period of duty, they will be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come careless, and their vigilance will be considerably</seg><seg type="columnLine">below normal. But the exact time of all these things de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pends entirely upon their conception of time, concerning</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we have no information whatever. Though it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">purely a speculation, based upon Earthly and Osnomian</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience, I should say that after twelve or thirteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours would come the time for us to make the attack."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's good enough for me. Fine, Mart, and thanks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You've probably saved the lives of the party. We will</seg><seg type="columnLine">now sleep for eleven or twelve hours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sleep, Dick! How could you ?" Dorothy exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           CHAPTER V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           First Blood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next twelve hours dragged with terrible slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. Sleep was impossible and eating was diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult, even though all knew that they would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">need of the full measure of their strength. Seaton set</seg><seg type="columnLine">up various combinations of switching devices connected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to electrical timers, and spent hours trying, with all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelous quickness of muscular control, to cut shorter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ever shorter the time between the opening and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">closing of the switch. At last he arranged a powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">electro-magnetic device so that one impulse would both</seg><seg type="columnLine">open and close the switch, with an open period of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">one-thousandth of a second.. Only then was he satisfied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A thousandth is enough to give us a look around,</seg><seg type="columnLine">due to persistence of vision; and it is short enough so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they won't see it unless they have a recording ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">server on us. Even if they still have rays on us, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't possibly neutralize our screens in that short an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posure. All right, gang? We'll take five visiplates and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover the sphere. If any of you get a glimpse of him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark the exact spot and outline on the glass. All set ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He pressed the button. The stars flashed in the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">yoid for an instant, then were again shut out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here he is, Dick!" shrieked Margaret. "Right here--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he covered almost half the visiplate!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She outlined for him, as nearly as she could, the exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">position of the object she had seen, and he calculated</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine business!" he exulted. "He's within half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile of us, three-quarters on--perfect! I thought he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">be so far away that I'd have to take photographs to lo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate him. He hasn't a single ray on us, either. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird's goose is cooked right now, folks, unless every man</seg><seg type="columnLine">on watch has his hand right on the controls of a genera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor and can get into action in less than a tenth of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second! Hang on, gang, I'm going to step on the gas!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">After making sure that everyone was fastened im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">movably in their seats he strapped himself in the pilot's</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat, then set the bar toward the strange vessel and ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied fully one-third of its full power. The Skylark, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, did not move. Then, with bewildering rapidity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went into action; face glued to the visiplate, hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving faster than the eye could follow--the left clos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and opening the switch controlling the zone of force,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right swinging the steering controls to all points of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sphere. The mighty vessel staggered this way and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, jerking and straining terribly as the zone was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown on and off, lurching sickeningly about the central</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing as the gigantic power of the driving bar was</seg><seg type="columnLine">exerted, now in one direction, now in another. After a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second or two of this mad gyration, Seaton shut off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power. He then released the zone, after assuring himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">that both inner and outer screens were operating at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">highest possible rating.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There, that'll hold 'em for a while, I guess. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle was even shorter than the other one--and a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">more decisive. Let's turn on the flood-lights and see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the pieces look like."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lights revealed that the zone of force had indeed</seg><seg type="columnLine">sliced the enemy vessel into pieces. No fragment was</seg><seg type="columnLine">large enough to be navigable or dangerous and each was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply cut, as though sheared from its neighbor by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some gigantic curved blade. Dorothy sobbed with relief</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Seaton's arms as Crane, with one arm around his wife,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was flawless, Dick. As an exhibition of perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">co-ordination and instantaneous timing under extreme</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical difficulties, I have never seen its equal."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You certainly saved all our lives," Margaret added.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Only fifty-fifty, Peg," Seaton protested, and blushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">vividly. "Mart did most of it, you know. I'd have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gummed up everything back there if he had let me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let's see what we can find out about them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He touched the lever and the Skylark moved slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the wreckage, the scattered fragments of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were beginning to move toward and around each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of their mutual gravitational forces. Snapping</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a searchlight, he swung its beam around, and as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled upon one of the larger sections he saw a group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooded figures; some of them upon the metal, others</seg><seg type="columnLine">floating slowly toward it through space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poor devils--they didn't have a chance," he remarked</seg><seg type="columnLine">regretfully. "However, it was either they or we--look</seg><seg type="columnLine">out! Sweet spirits of niter!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He leaped back to the controls and the others were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled bodily to the floor as he applied the power--for at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a signal each of the hooded figures had leveled a tube and</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more the outer screen had flamed into incandescence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the Skylark leaped away, Seaton focussed an attractor</seg><seg type="columnLine">SKYLARK THREE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">405</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the one who had apparently signaled the attack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rolling the vessel over in a short loop, so that the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive was hurled off into space upon the other side, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched the tube from the figure's grasp with one aux-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iliary attractor, and anchored head and limbs with others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that the prisoner could scarcely move a muscle. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Crane and the women scrambled up off the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hurried to the visiplates, Seaton cut in rays six, two-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven, and five-eight. Ray six, "the softener," was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">band of frequencies extending from violet far up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ultra-violet. When driven with sufficient power,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this ray destroyed eyesight and nervous tissue, and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">power increased still further, actually loosened the mole-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cular structure of matter. Ray two-seven was operated</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a range of frequencies far below the visible red. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pure heat--under its action matter became hotter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hotter as long as it was applied, the upper limit be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing only the theoretical maximum of temperature. Ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">five-eight was high-tension, high-frequency alternating</seg><seg type="columnLine">current. Any conductor in its path behaved precisely</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it would in the Ajax-Northrup induction furnace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which can boil platinum in ten seconds! These three</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays composed the beam which Seaton directed upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of metal from which the enemy had elected to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinue the battle--and behind each ray, instead of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small energy at the command of its Osnomian inventor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the untold millions of kilowatts developed by a one-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred-pound bar of disintegrating copper!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I HERE ensued a brief but appalling demonstration</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the terrible effectiveness of those Osnomian</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons against anything not protected by ultra-powered</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray screens. Metal and men--if men they were--lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erally vanished. One moment they were outlined</seg><seg type="columnLine">starkly in the beam; there was a moment of searing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coruscating, blinding light--the next moment the beam</seg><seg type="columnLine">bored on into the void, unimpeded. Nothing was visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">save an occasional tiny flash, as some condensed or solidi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied droplet of the volatilized metal re-entered the path</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that ravening beam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll see if there's any more of them loose," Seaton</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked, as he shut off the force and probed into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreckage with a searchlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No sign of life or of activity was revealed, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light was turned upon the captive. He was held motion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less in the invisible grip of the attractors, at the point</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the force of those peculiar magnets was exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">balanced by the outward thrust of the repellers. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">manipulating the attractor holding it, Seaton brought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange tubular weapon into the control-room through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small air-lock in the wall and examined it curiously, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not touch it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I never heard of a hand-ray before, so I guess I</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't play with it much until after I learn something</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you have taken a captive?" asked Margaret.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What are you going to do with him ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going to drag him in here and read his mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's one of the officers of that ship, I believe, and I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to find out how to build one exactly like it. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">old can is now as obsolete as a 1920 flivver, and I'm going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make us a later model. How about it, Mart, don't we</seg><seg type="columnLine">want something really up-to-date if we're going to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">on space-hopping?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We Gertainly do. Those denizens seem to be par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticularly venomous, and we will not be safe unless we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have the most powerful and most efficient space-ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible. However, that fellow may be dangerous, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">now--in fact, it is practically certain that he is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You chirped it, ace. I'd much rather touch a pound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dry nitrogen iodide. I've got him spread-eagled so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he can't destroy his brain until after we've read it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, so there's no particular hurry about him. We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave him out there for a while, to waste his sweetness</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the desert air. Let's all look around for the Kondal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sure hope they didn't get her in that fracas."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They diffused the rays of eight giant searchlights</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a vertical fan, and with it swept slowly through al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most a semi-circle before anything was seen. Then there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was revealed a cluster of cylindrical objects amid a mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wreckage, which Crane recognized at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Kondal is gone, Dick. There is what is left of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, and most of her cargo of salt, in jute bags."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he spoke, a series of green flashes played upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bags, and Seaton yelled in relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They got the ship all right, but Dunark and Sitar got</seg><seg type="columnLine">away--they're still with their salt!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Skylark moved over to the wreck and Seaton, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">linquishing the controls to Crane, donned a vacuum suit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the main air-lock and snapped on the motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">which sealed off the lock, pumped the air into a pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure-tank, and opened the outside door. He threw a light</seg><seg type="columnLine">line to the two figures and pushed himself lightly toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. He then talked briefly to Dunark in the hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">language, and handed the end of the line to Sitar, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">held it while the two men explored the fragments of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange vessel, gathering up various things of interest as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they came upon them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back in the control-room, Dunark and Sitar let their</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure decrease gradually to that of the terrestrial ves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sel and removed the face-plates from their helmets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Again, oh Karfedo of Earth, we thank you for our</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives," Dunark began, gasping for breath, when Seaton</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped to the air-gauge with a quick apology.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never thought of the effect our atmospheric pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have on you two. We can stand yours all right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but you'd pretty nearly pass out on ours. There, that'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit you better. Didn't you throw out your zone of</seg><seg type="columnLine">force ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, as soon as I saw that our screens were not going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold." The Osnomians' labored breathing became</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal as the air-pressure increased to a value only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little below that of the dense atmosphere of their native</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet. "I then increased the power of the screens to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extreme limit and opened the zone for a moment to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">how the screens would hold with the added power.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That instant was enough. In that period a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrated beam, such as I had no idea could ever be</seg><seg type="columnLine">generated, went through the outer and inner screens as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though they were not there, through the four-foot arenak</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hull, through the entire central installation, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the hull on the other side. Sitar and I were</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearing suits. ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say, Mart, that's one bet we overlooked. It's a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea, too--those strangers wore them all the time as</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular equipment, apparently. Next time we get into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a jam, be sure we do it; they might come in handy. Ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuse me, Dunark--go ahead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We had suits on, so as soon as the ray was shut off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was almost instantly, I phoned the crew to jump,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we leaped out through the hole in the hull. The air</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing out gave us an impetus that carried us many</seg><seg type="columnLine">406</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">miles out into space, and it required many hours for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight attraction of the mass here to draw us back to it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We just got back a few minutes ago. That air-blast is</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably what saved us, as they destroyed our vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">with atomic bombs and hunted down the four men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our crew, who stayed comparatively close to the scene.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They rayed you for about an hour with the most stu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendous beams imaginable--no such generators have</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever been considered possible of construction--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't make any impression upon you. Then they</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut off their power and stood by, waiting. I wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at you when you released your zone. One mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment it was there, and the next, the stranger had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut in pieces. The rest you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're sure glad you two got away, Dunark. Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mart, what say we drag that guy in and give him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">once-over ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">O	EATON swung the attractors holding the prisoner</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they were in line with the main air-lock, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">reduced the power of the repellers. As he approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lock various controls were actuated, and soon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger stood in the control room, held immovable</seg><seg type="columnLine">against one wall, while Crane, with a 0.50-caliber ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phant gun, stood against the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps you girls should go somewhere else," sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested Crane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not on your life!" protested Dorothy, who, eyes wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flushed with excitement, stood near a door, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy automatic pistol in her hand. "I wouldn't miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">this for a farm!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got him solid," declared Seaton, after a careful in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spection of the various attractors and repellers he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing upon the prisoner. "Now let's get him out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that suit. No--better read his air first, temperature and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure--might analyze it, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing could be seen of the person of the stranger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since he was encased in vacuum armor, but it was plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident that he was very short and immensely broad and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick. By means of hollow needles forced through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leather-like material of the suit Seaton drew off a sample</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the atmosphere within, into an Orsat apparatus, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crane made pressure and temperature readings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Temperature, one hundred ten degrees. Pressure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-eight pounds--about the same as ours is, now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have stepped it up to keep the Osnomians from suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fering."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seaton soon reported that the atmosphere was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar to that of the Skylark, except that it was much</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher in carbon dioxide and carried an extremely high</seg><seg type="columnLine">percentage of water vapor. He took up a pair of heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">shears and laid the suit open full length, on both sides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing that the powerful attractors would hold the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger immovable. He then wrenched off the helmet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cast the whole suit aside, revealing the enemy officer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad in a tunic of scarlet silk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was less than five feet tall. His legs were merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocks, fully as great in diameter as they were in length,</seg><seg type="columnLine">supporting a torso of Herculean dimensions. His arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">were as large as a strong man's thigh and hung almost to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor. His astounding shoulders, fully a yard across,</seg><seg type="columnLine">merged into and supported an enormous head. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">being possessed recognizable nose, ears, and mouth; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great domed forehead and huge cranium bespoke an</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense and a highly developed brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was the eyes of this strange creature that fixed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and held the attention. Large they were, and black--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dull, opaque, lusterless black of platinum sponge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pupils were a brighter black, and in them flamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruby lights: pitiless, mocking, cold. Plainly to be read</seg><seg type="columnLine">in those sinister depths were the untold wisdom of un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinkable age, sheer ruthlessness, mighty power, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferocity unrelieved. His baleful gaze swept from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">member of the party to another, and to meet the glare of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those eyes was to receive a tangible physical blow--it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was actually ponderable force; that of embodied hardness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of ruthlessness incarnate, generated in that merci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less brain and hurled forth through those flame-shot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stygian orbs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you don't need us for anything, Dick, I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peggy and I will go upstairs," Dorothy broke the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good idea, Dot. This isn't going to be pretty to</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch--or to do, either, for that matter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I stay here another minute I'll see that thing as</seg><seg type="columnLine">long as I live; and I might be very ill. Goodbye," and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heartless and bloodthirsty Osnomian though she was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sitar had gone to join the two Terrestrial women.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't want to say much before the girls, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to check a couple of ideas with you two.

"Any race</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of developing such a vessel as this would almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly have developed systems of communication in</seg><seg type="columnLine">proportion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's the way I doped it out--and that's why I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to read his mind, if I have to burn out his brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do it. We've got to know how far away from home</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is, whether he has turned in any report about us, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all about it. Also, I'm going to get the plans, power, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">armament of their most modern ships, if he knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, so that your gang, Dunark, can build us one</seg><seg type="columnLine">like them; because the next boat that tackles us will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned and we won't be able to take it by surprise. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't stand a chance in the Skylark. With a ship like</seg><seg type="columnLine">theirs, however, we can run--or we can fight, if we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to. Any other ideas, fellows?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS neither Crane nor Dunark had any other sugges-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">-	tions to offer, Seaton brought out the mechanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">educator, watching the creature's eyes narrowly. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed one headset over that motionless head the captive</seg><seg type="columnLine">sneered in pure contempt, but when the case was opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the array of tubes and transformers was revealed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that expression disappeared; and when he added a super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">power stage by cutting in a heavy-duty transformer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a five-kilowatt transmitting tube, Seaton thought that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw an instantaneously suppressed flicker of doubt or</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That headset thing was child's play to him, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't like the looks of this other stuff at all. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">blame him a bit--I wouldn't like to be on the receiving</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of this hook-up myself. I'm going to put him on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">recorder and on the visualizer," Seaton continued as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">connected spools of wire and tape, lamps, and lenses in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an intricate system and donned a headset. "I'd hate to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have much of that brain in my own skull--afraid I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">bite myself. I'm just going to look on, and when I see</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything I want, I'll grab it and put it into my own brain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm starting off easy, not using the big tube."</seg><seg type="columnLine">SKYLARK THREE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">m</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He closed several switches, lights flashed, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wires and tapes began to feed through the magnets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I've got his language, folks, he seemed to want</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to have it. It's got a lot of stuff in it that I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand yet, though, so guess I'll give him some</seg><seg type="columnLine">English.",</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He changed several connections and the captive spoke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a profoundly deep bass voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''You may as well discontinue your attempt, for you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will gain no information from me.

If you don't, I'll put on enough volt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age to burn your brain out. Remember, I can read your</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead brain as well as though it were alive, but I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">your thoughts, as well as your knowledge, and I'm going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have them. If you give them voluntarily, I will tinker</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a lifeboat that you can navigate back to your own</seg><seg type="columnLine">world and let you go; if you resist I intend getting them</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway and you shall not leave this vessel alive. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">may take your choice."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are childish, and that machine is impotent</seg><seg type="columnLine">against my will.

Know you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">American, that we supermen of the Fenachrone are as</seg><seg type="columnLine">far above any of the other and lesser breeds of beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">who spawn in their millions in their countless myriads of</seg><seg type="columnLine">races upon the numberless planets of the Universe as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are above the inert metal from which this, your ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was built. The Universe is ours, and in due course we</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall take it--just as in due course I shall take this vessel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Do your worst; I shall not speak." The creature's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">flamed, hurling a wave of hypnotic command through</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seaton's eyes and deep into his brain. Seaton's very</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses reeled for an instant under the impact of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful mental force; but after a short, intensely bitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle he threw off the spell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was close, fellow, but you didn't quite ring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell," he said grimly, staring directly into those unholy</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. "I may rate pretty low mentally, but I can't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypnotized into turning you loose. Also I can give you</seg><seg type="columnLine">cards and spades in certain other lines which I am about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to demonstrate. Being supermen didn't keep the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your men from going out in my ray, and being a super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man isn't going to save your brain. I am not depending</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon my intellectual or mental force--I've got an ace in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hole in the shape of five thousand volts to apply to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most delicate centers of your brain. Start giving me</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I want, and start quick, or I'll tear it out of you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The giant did not answer, merely glared defiance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitter hate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take it, then!" Seaton snapped, and cut in the super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">power stage and began turning dials and knobs, explor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that strange mind for the particular area in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was most interested. He soon found it, and cut in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the visualizer--the stereographic device, in parallel with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seaton's own brain recorder, which projected a three-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensional picture into the "viewing-area" or dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">space of the cabinet. Crane and Dunark, tense and</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent, looked on in strained suspense as, minute after</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute, the silent battle of wills raged. Upon one side</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a horrible and gigantic brain, of undreamed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">power; upon the other side a strong man, fighting for all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that life holds dear, wielding against that monstrous and</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightful frrain a weapon wrought of high-tension elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricity, applied with all the skill that earthly and Osno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mian science could devise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Seaton crouched over the amplifier, his jaw set and</seg><seg type="columnLine">every muscle taut, his eyes leaping from one meter to</seg><seg type="columnLine">another, his right hand slowly turning up the potentio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meter which was driving more and ever more of the sear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, torturing output of his super-power tube into that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stubborn brain. The captive was standing utterly rigid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes closed, every sense and faculty mustered to resist</seg><seg type="columnLine">that cruelly penetrant attack upon the very innermost</seg><seg type="columnLine">recesses of his mind. Crane and Dunark scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathed as the three-dimensional picture in the visual-</seg><seg type="columnLine">izer varied from a blank to the hazy outlines of a giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-cruiser. It faded out as the unknown exerted him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self to withstand that poignant inquisition, only to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in, clearer than before, as Seaton advanced the po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentiometer still farther. Finally, flesh and blood could</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer resist that lethal probe and the picture became</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp and clear. It showed the captain--for he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no less an officer than the commander of the vessel--at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great council table, seated, together with many other</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers, upon very low, enormously strong metal stools.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were receiving orders from their Emperor; orders</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly understood by Crane and the Osnomian alike, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought needs no translation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gentlemen of the Navy," the ruler spoke solemnly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Our preliminary expedition, returned some time ago,</seg><seg type="columnLine">achieved its every aim, and we are now ready to begin</seg><seg type="columnLine">fulfilling our destiny, the Conquest of the Universe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This Galaxy comes first. Our base of operations will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the largest planet of that group of brilliant green suns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for they can be seen from any point in the Galaxy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">are almost in the exact center of it. Our astronomers,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">here the captain's thoughts shifted briefly to an observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory far out in space for perfect seeing, and portrayed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflecting telescope with a mirror five miles in diameter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of penetrating unimaginable myriads of light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">years into space, "have tabulated all the suns, planets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and satellites belonging to this Galaxy, and each of you</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been given a complete chart and assigned a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">area which he is to explore. Remember, gentlemen, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this first major expedition is to be purely one of explora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion; the one of conquest will set out after you have re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned with complete information. You will each re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port by torpedo every tenth of the year. We do not an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticipate any serious difficulty, as we are of course the</seg><seg type="columnLine">highest type of life in the Universe; nevertheless, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlikely event of trouble, report it. We shall do the rest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">' In conclusion, I warn you again---let no people know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we exist. Make no conquests, and destroy all who</seg><seg type="columnLine">by any chance may see you. Gentlemen, go with power."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The captain embarked in a small airboat and was shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his vessel. He took his station at an immense control</seg><seg type="columnLine">board and the warship shot off instantly, with unthink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able velocity, and with not the slightest physical shock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At this point Seaton made the captain take them all</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the ship. They noted its construction, its power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plant, its controls--every minute detail of structure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation, and maintenance was taken from the captain's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind and was both recorded and visualized.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE journey seemed to be a very long one, but finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cluster of green suns became visible and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fenachrone began to explore the solar systems in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">408</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">area assigned to that particular vessel. Hardly had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">survey started, however, when the two globular space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruisers were detected and located. The captain stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship briefly, then attacked. They watched the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack, and saw the destruction of the Kondal. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked on while the captain read the brain of one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dunark's crew, gleaning from it all the facts concerning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two space-ships, and thought with him that the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">absentees from the Kondal would drift back in a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours, and would be disposed of in due course. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned that these things were automatically impressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the torpedo next to issue, as was every detail of</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything that happened in and around the vessel. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him impress a thought of his own upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">record--"the inhabitants of planet three of sun six four</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven three Pilarone show unusual development and may</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause trouble, as they have already brought knowledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the metal of power and of the impenetrable shield to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Central System, which is to be our base. Recommend</seg><seg type="columnLine">volatilization of this planet by vessel sent on special</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission." They saw the raying of the Skylark. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensed him issue commands:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ray it for a time; he will probably open the shield for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment, as the other one did," then, after a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipped over by the mind under examination, "Cease</seg><seg type="columnLine">raying--no use wasting power. He must open eventu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally, as he runs out of power. Stand by and destroy</seg><seg type="columnLine">him when he opens."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scene shifted. The captain was asleep and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakened by an alarm gong--only to find himself float-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in a mass of wreckage. Making his way to the frag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of his vessel containing the torpedo port, he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leased the messenger, which flew, with ever-increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">velocity, back to the capital city of the Fenachrone, carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with it a record of everything that had happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's what I want," thought Seaton. "Those tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedos went home, fast. I want to know how far they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to go and how long it'll take them to get there. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what distance a parsec is, since it is purely a math-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ematical concept; and you must have a watch or some</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar instrument with which we can translate your</seg><seg type="columnLine">years into ours. I don't want to have to kill you, fellow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if you'll give up even now I'll spare you. I'll get it</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway, .you know--and you also know that a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred volts more will kill you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They saw the thought received, and saw its answer:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You shall learn no more. This is the most important</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all, and I shall hold it to disintegration and beyond."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seaton advanced the potentiometer still farther, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brain picture waxed and waned, strengthened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">faded. Finally, however, it was revealed by flashes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the torpedo had about a hundred and fifty-five thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">parsecs to go and that it would take two-tenths of a year</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make the journey; that the warships which would come</seg><seg type="columnLine">in answer to the message were as fast as the torpedo;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he did indeed have in his suit a watch--a device of</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven dials, each turning ten times as fast as its succes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sor ; and that one turn of the slowest dial measured one</seg><seg type="columnLine">year of his time. Seaton instantly threw off his headset</seg><seg type="columnLine">and opened the power switch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Grab a stopwatch quick, Mart!" he called, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped to the discarded vacuum suit and searched out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar timepiece. They noted the exact time consumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by one complete revolution of one of the dials, and cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culated rapidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better than I thought!" exclaimed Seaton. "That</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">makes his year about four hundred ten of our days. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">gives us eighty-two days before the torpedo gets there--</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer than I'd dared hope. We've got to fight, too, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">run. They figure on getting the Skylark, then volatiliz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing our world. Well, we can take time enough to grab</seg><seg type="columnLine">off an absolutely complete record of this guy's brain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'll need it for what's coming, and I'm going to get it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I have to kill him to do it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He resumed his place at the educator, turned on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power, and a shadow passed over his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Poor devil, he's conked out--couldn't stand the gaff,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he remarked, half-regretfully. "However, that makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">it easy to get what we want, and we'd have had to kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">him anyway, I guess--Bad as it is, I'd hate to bump him</seg><seg type="columnLine">off in cold blood."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He threaded new spools into the machine, and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">three hours, mile after mile of tape sped between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnets as Seaton explored every recess of that mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strous, yet stupendous brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, that's that," he declared finally, as, the last bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of information gleaned and recorded upon the flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">tape, he removed the body of the Fenachrone captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">into space and rayed it out of existence. "Now what</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "How can we get this salt to Osnome?" asked Dunark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose thoughts were never far from that store of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">precious chemical. "You are already crowded, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sitar and I will crowd you still more. You have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">room for additional cargo, and yet much valuable time</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be lost in going to Osnome for another vessel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes, and we've got to get a lot of 'X', too. Guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll have to take time to get another vessel. I'd like to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drag in the pieces of that ship, too--his instruments and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lot of the parts could be used."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not do it all at once ?" suggested Crane. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">can start that whole mass toward Osnome by drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it behind us until such a velocity has been attained that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it will reach there at the desired time. We could then go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to 'X,' and overtake this material near the green system."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right you are, ace--that's a sound idea. But say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dunark, it wouldn't be good technique for you to eat</seg><seg type="columnLine">our food for any length of time. While we're figuring</seg><seg type="columnLine">this out you'd better hop over there and bring over</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to last you two until we get you home. Give it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Shiro--after a couple of lessons, you'll find he'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">as good as any of your cooks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'C'ASTER and faster the Skylark flew, pulling be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">-*• hind her the mass of wreckage, held by every avail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able^ attractor. When the calculated velocity had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">attained, the attractors were shut off and the vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted away toward that planet, still in the Carbonifer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous Age, which possessed at least one solid ledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metallic "X," the rarest of all earthly metals. As the</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic controls held the cruiser upon her course, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">six wanderers sat long in discussion as to what should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">done, what could be done, to avert the threatened de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction of all the civilization of the Galaxy except the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrous and unspeakable culture of the Fenachrone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nearing their destination, Seaton rose to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, folks, it's like this. We've got our backs to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall. Dunark has troubles of his own--if the Third</seg><seg type="columnLine">Planet doesn't get him the Fenachrone will, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Third Planet is the more pressing danger. That lets him</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. We've got nearly six months before the Fenachrone</seg><seg type="columnLine">can get back here. ..."</seg><seg type="columnLine">SKYLARK THREE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">409</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how can they possibly find us here, or wherever</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll be by that time, Dick ?" asked Dorothy. "The battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a long way from here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With that much start they probably couldn't find</seg><seg type="columnLine">us," Seaton replied soberly. "It's the world I'm think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about. They've got to be stopped, and stopped cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and we've got only six months to do it in. . . . Os-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nome's got the best tools and the fastest workmen I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know of. ..his voice died away in thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That sort of thing is in your department, Dick."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crane was calm and judicial as always. "I will, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, do anything I can, but you probably have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan of campaign already laid out?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After a fashion. We've got to find out how to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">through this zone of force or we're sunk without a trace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even with rays, screens, and ships equal to theirs, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't keep them from sending a vessel to destroy the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth; and they'd probably get us too, eventually.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They've got a lot of stuff we don't know about, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, since I took only one man's mind. While he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very able man, he didn't know all that all the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them do, any more than any one man has all the earthly</seg><seg type="columnLine">science known. Absolutely our only chance is to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol that zone--it's the only thing they haven't got. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, it may be impossible, but I won't believe that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until I've exhausted a lot of possibilities. Dunark, can</seg><seg type="columnLine">you spare a crew to build us a duplicate of that Fena-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chrone ship, besides those you are going to build for</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly. I will be only too glad to do so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, then, while Dunark is doing that, I suggest</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we go to this Third Planet, abduct a few of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading scientists, and read their minds. Then do the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same, visiting every other highly advanced planet we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can locate. There is a good chance that, by combining</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best points of the warfares of many worlds, we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolve something that will enable us to turn back these</seg><seg type="columnLine">invaders."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not send a copper torpedo to destroy their</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire planet?" suggested Dunark. *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wouldn't work. Their detecting screens would lo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate it a thousand million miles off in space, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would ray it. With a zone of force that would get</seg><seg type="columnLine">through their screens, that would be the first thing I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. You see, every thought comes back to that zone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We've got to get through it some way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The course alarm sounded, and they saw that a planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay directly in their path. It was "X," and enough nega-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive acceleration was applied to make an easy landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Isn't it going to be a long, slow job, chopping off two</seg><seg type="columnLine">tons of that metal and fighting away those terrible ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals besides ?" asked Margaret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It'll take about a millionth of a second, Peg. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to bite it off with the zone, just as I took that</seg><seg type="columnLine">bite out of our field. The rotation of the planet will</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw us away from the surface, then we'll release the</seg><seg type="columnLine">zone and drag our prey off with us. See ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Skylark descended rapidly toward that well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered ledge of metal to which the object compass</seg><seg type="columnLine">had led them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is exactly where we landed before," Margaret</seg><seg type="columnLine">commented in surprise, and Dorothy added:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, and there's that horrible tree that ate the din-</seg><seg type="columnLine">osaur or whatever it was.

Must be a good</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">location for carnivorous trees--and they must grow</seg><seg type="columnLine">awfully fast, too. As to its being the same place, Peg</seg><seg type="columnLine">--sure it is. That's what object compasses are for."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everything appeared as it had been at the time of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their first visit. The rank Carboniferous vegetation, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensely, vividly green, was motionless' in the still, hot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy air; the living nightmares inhabiting that primi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive world were lying in the cooler depths of the jungle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheltered from the torrid rays of that strange and fervent</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How about it, Dot? Want to see some of your little</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends again? If you do, I'll give them a shot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring them out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Heavens, no! I saw them once--if I never see them</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, that will be twenty minutes too soon!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right--we'll grab us a piece of this ledge and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seaton lowered the vessel to the ledge, focussed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main anchoring attractor upon it, and threw on the zone</seg><seg type="columnLine">of force. Almost immediately he released the zone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed the bar parallel to the compass bearing upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Osnome, and slowly applied the power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How much did you take, anyway?" asked Dunark</seg><seg type="columnLine">in amazement. "It looks bigger than the Skylark!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is; considerably bigger. Thought we might as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">take enough while we're here, so I set the zone for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventy-five-foot radius. It's probably of the order of</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnitude of half a million tons, since the stuff weighs</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than half a ton to the cubic foot. However, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can handle it as easily as we could a smaller bite, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that much mass will help us hold that other stuff together</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we catch up with it,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE voyage to Osnome was uneventful. They over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the wreckage, true to schedule, as they were ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching the green system, and attached it to the mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of metal behind them by means of attractors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where'll we land this junk, Dunark?" asked Seaton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Osnome grew large beneath them. We'll hold this</seg><seg type="columnLine">lump of metal and the fragment of the ship carrying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">salt; and we'll be able to hold some of the most im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant of the other stuff. But a lot of it is bound to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get away from us--and the Lord help anybody who's</seg><seg type="columnLine">under it when it comes down! You might yell for help--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and say, you might ask somebody to have that astronom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical data ready for us as soon as we land."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The parade ground will be empty now, so we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">land there," Dunark replied. "We should be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">land everything in a field of that size, I should think."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He touched the sender at his belt, and in the general code</seg><seg type="columnLine">notified the city of their arrival and warned everyone to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep away from the parade ground. He then sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">several messages in the official code, concluding by asking</seg><seg type="columnLine">that one or two space-ships come out and help lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">the burden to the ground. As the peculiar, pulsating</seg><seg type="columnLine">chatter of the Osnomian telegraph died out, Seaton called</seg><seg type="columnLine">for help.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come here, you two, and grab some of these attrac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">"shop" had been enlarged and had been filled to capacity</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Osnomian machinery; machine tools that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of performing automatically and with the utmost</seg><seg type="columnLine">precision and speed any conceivable mechanical opera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. He put a dozen of them to work, and before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel reached its destination, the new offensive and</seg><seg type="columnLine">defensive weapons had been installed and thoroughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">tested.

After that, I shall tell you what to say to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you think this is altogether safe, Dick?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crane as they saw a fleet of gigantic airships soaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward to meet them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing sure but death and taxes," returned Seaton</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerfully, "but don't forget that we've got Fenachrone</seg><seg type="columnLine">armament now, instead of Osnomian. I'm betting that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they can't begin to drive their rays through even our</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer screen. And even if our outer screen should begin</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go into the violet--I don't think it will even go</seg><seg type="columnLine">cherry-red--out goes our zone of force and we auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matically go up where no possible airship can reach.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Since their only space-ships are rocket driven, and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically no maneuverability, they stand a big chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of getting to us. Anyway, we must get in touch with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, to find out if they know anything we don't, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this is the only way I know of to do it. Besides, I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to head Dunark off from wrecking this world. They're</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly the same kind of folks he is, you notice, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't like civil war. Any suggestions? Keep an eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">on that bird, then, Mart, and we'll go down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Skylark dropped down into the midst of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet, which instantly turned against her the full</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of their giant guns and their immense ray bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teries.

After fifteen minutes of passive acceptance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the airships could do, Seaton spoke to the captive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sir, please signal the commanding officer of vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven-two-four that I am going to cut it in two in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle.

The defensive screens of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doomed warship flashed once--a sparkling, corruscating</seg><seg type="columnLine">display of incandescent brilliance--and in the same in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant went down. Simultaneously the entire midsection</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the vessel exploded into light and disappeared; com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely volatilized.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sir, please signal the entire fleet to cease action, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow me down. If they do not do so, I will destroy</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Skylark dropped to the ground, followed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet of warships, who settled in a ring about her--in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">active, but ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will you please loan me your sending instrument,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir?" Seaton asked. "From this point on I can carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">on negotiations better direct than through you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lieutenant found his voice as he surrendered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sir, are you the Overlord of Osnome, of whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have heard ?

No sooner had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthly vessel alighted upon the palace grounds than</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was surrounded by a ring of warships who, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made no offensive move.

"I repeat that your</seg><seg type="columnLine">act was not weakness, but wisdom. The second thing I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to say is that I had not planned on taking any active</seg><seg type="columnLine">part in the management of things, either upon Osnome</seg><seg type="columnLine">or upon this planet, until I learned of a catastrophe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is threatening all the civilization in this Galaxy--thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatening my own distant world as well as those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this solar system. Third, only by superior force can</seg><seg type="columnLine">I make either your race or the Osnomians listen to reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficiently to unite against a common foe.

Men who fought against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the images cut them through and through with swords,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but could not harm them since they were not actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance; and the images directed rays against the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that they were stunned. So the visitors fought in</seg><seg type="columnLine">days long gone, and vanished in their zones of force.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How does that sound?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have the most stupendous imagination the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">has ever seen--but there may be some slight basis of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact there, after all," said Crane, slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm convinced of it, for one reason in particular.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Notice that it says specifically that the visitors stunned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the natives.

However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get back to the subject, I found that even with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new power of the compass the entire planet was still out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of reach.

The internal organs</seg><seg type="columnLine">were found in excellent condition. There was no poison</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the stomach. There was no evidence of heart trouble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The body was embalmed and interred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mystery remained a mystery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet Dr. Willie Jones, assistant to Professor Brown,</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided that he was not through with the case. He de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined to take it up as a research problem and solve it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He set about interviewing members of the last class in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed by the professor, and found that he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">lecturing on, and demonstrating, a new induction</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnace, the new electrical furnace for metals. The one</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had was an experimental one. He showed the class</seg><seg type="columnLine">how he could hold his hand in this furnace without dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfort, provided there were no rings on his fingers, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if he held a nail in the furnace it soon became red</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot. Iron and that furnace, apparently, didn't agree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jones decided to look over this furnace. He found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was insecurely fastened to the wall, and, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, saw a screw-driver that had evidently been</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped on the floor. As the furnace was going when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body was found, Jones was satisfied that it was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nected in some way with the death of the professor. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore picked up the screw-driver and started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tighten the screw that was loose which was outside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found that the most convenient position for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to assume in tightening this screw placed the top of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head in the mouth of the furnace itself. And here he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more mystified than ever. This should not cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">any discomfort, much less death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So temporarily Jones gave up trying to solve the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery of the death of Prof. Brown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When, however, he saw the police report he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the matter harder than ever, and finally arrived at</seg><seg type="columnLine">an astounding conclusion. He went to see the coroner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated that he was absolutely certain that the old scalp</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound suffered by the professor during the war had con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained a fragment of metal, that this metal had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">red hot when the Professor poked his head into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">induction furnace, and had killed his chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After some persuasion the coroner agreed to disinter</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body and take an X-ray of the head. This was done</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disclosed that Jones was correct, and that the frag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of iron had burned a clean hole from just under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of the skull down through the brain as its weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused it to sink down into the hole which it had burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">for itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Brown had forgotten that the surgeon</seg><seg type="columnLine">had told him there might still be a small fragment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron left in his skull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The End</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peter van Dresser</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">(iConcerning d possible future industry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">s$me episodes of interest connected with it.)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Illustrated</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MOREY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">i</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">So these were the mighty steel monsters which hauled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the produce of New Sidney to the outer world!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"PECULIARLY opportune at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">MT time is a story dealing with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">antarctic Polar regions.

It was a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">country hostile to mankind--a country of vast snow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deserts seamed by treacherous crevasses, of high solitary</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plateaus swept by terrific windstorms, of gaunt mountain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ranges whose rocky flanks jutted up through the mo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">notonous mantle of white. During four weary months of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">t each year it was a land of deadly cold and darkness, when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the aurora australis flickered and wove eerie shifting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">patterns of greenish light in the chill sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Hamilton thought of the early antarctic explorations</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> which preceded and made possible man's present fa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> miliarity with the south polar regions. Over a century</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ago--before the middle of the nineteenth century--ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> plorers had headed their sailing craft southward, to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> bottom of the world, in a serious attempt to penetrate</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the great ice barrier which everywhere guarded the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> antarctic coast line. Their ships were often crushed in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the relentless grasp of the ice, or overwhelmed in terrific</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> gales. . They were forced to endure sometimes years of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> imprisonment and solitude before they could fight their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> way northward again. Yet little by little such men as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cook, Ross, D'Urville and Wilkes, added to our store</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of knowledge concerning at least the outer limits of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> these unknown regions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   But it was not until the twentieth century that inland</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> expeditions of any length were made. Then Scott, Dry-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> galski, Shackleton, Bruce, and others penetrated some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> what into the interior, locating the coast line of Victoria</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> quadrant west of the Ross Sea, of Kaiser Wilhelm Sec-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ond Land in the Enderby quadrant, and of Coates Land</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and West Antarctica, that desolate archipelago thrusting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> out towards Cape Horn in the Weddel Sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   It seemed incredible that man should carry on for no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tangible reward under such difficult conditions as beset</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> these early explorers. All progress was made only by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the most dogged and continuous physical effort--weary</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> weeks and months of trekking on snow shoes or on skis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Sufficient food could be carried only by the most careful</seg><seg type="columnLine">planning, and when unexpected setbacks occurred, suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fering and privation inevitably followed. And always</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was the bitter cold waiting to cripple by frostbite</seg><seg type="columnLine">or kill outright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The climax of this era of exploration was reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Amundsen, in a carefully planned and perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">executed expedition reached the pole on December six-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teenth 1911, and returned safely. Almost a month later</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scott attained the same goal, only to meet bitter disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointment in the discovery of Amundsen's cairn, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim death on the return trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not until the nineteen-twenties that man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficiently perfected his new tools, the radio and the air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane, to enable him to employ them successfully in re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mote parts of the world. Hamilton remembered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">names of Byrd, the careful organizer and scientific ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plorer, and Wilkins, the brilliant free lance, as pioneers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of aeronautical polar expeditions. Since that time, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the improvement of equipment, antarctic exploration had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been carried farther and farther till by nineteen-forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole continent was fairly well mapped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For ten years then interest had been dormant. During</seg><seg type="columnLine">the period of exploration, the continent had been par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">celled tentatively out among several nations, notably</seg><seg type="columnLine">England, the United States, Norway and Germany. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest had been rather keen in this division, and several</seg><seg type="columnLine">disputes had arisen over boundaries and conflicting</seg><seg type="columnLine">claims, but as the years rolled by this interest waned, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">no rich deposits of coal, mica or petroleum, as had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected, were discovered. In 1952, by mutual consent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the interested nations, administration of the antarctic</seg><seg type="columnLine">regions had been transferred to an unimportant bureau</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the League of Nations. The principal questions</seg><seg type="columnLine">which arose concerning these regions were those relating</seg><seg type="columnLine">to maritime and aeronautical law, and hence were of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ternational concern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus Antarctica remained a desolate waste, crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a few dirigible lines and now and then by scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">expeditions in planes or motor sleds for the purpose of</seg><seg type="columnLine">making geological, meteorological, or magnetic observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then in 1957 Frobisher--Sydney Frobisher, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">picturesque, reckless, hard-bitten adventurer and scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tific pioneer--had come up from this forgotten bottom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world with startling news.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the barren uplands three hundred miles southwest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">King Edward VII Land he had discovered phenomen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally rich veins of aluminum and beryllium metasilicate!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">417</seg><seg type="columnLine">418</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hamilton remembered the excitement that prevailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the information leaked out. Twenty-two years</seg><seg type="columnLine">earlier the refinement of beryllium ores had become com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercially practicable, and alloys of the metal were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly introduced into airplane and airship construction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fairly large deposits near Nerchinsk, in Siberia, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved the best source of supply hitherto, but Frobish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er's discovery revealed vast possibilities. And that versa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tile man, as soon as he arrived in Australia, had devoted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his great energy and powerful personality to organizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a company for the development of these possibilities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hamilton remembered well the aura of romantic ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture which had invested Frobisher's name; in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">age when romance and adventure were seemingly dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the world a well-charted and easily traversed globe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In 1955 he had set out alone from Little America in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">light Alfure tractor-sled equipped with a molecular</seg><seg type="columnLine">resonance ore finder and analyzer. The antarctic had</seg><seg type="columnLine">swallowed him up, and the public read of another crazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospector risking his life futilely. Hamilton could im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agine him guiding his machine over terrain like that</seg><seg type="columnLine">below--picking his way around dangerous crevasses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">breasting furious blizzards, making his little camp at</seg><seg type="columnLine">night crouched over his butylene stove. He reappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">in three months--said little, laid in provisions and disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared again. For two years Frobisher maintained this</seg><seg type="columnLine">schedule--until one day he returned to make his amazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">announcement. Not to the public at first--not until</seg><seg type="columnLine">South Polar Beryllium Ltd. of Melbourne was organized</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had gained control of the richest of the deposits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hamilton, young and impressionable at the time, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been thrilled at the wonderful display of the powers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the modern engineering and economic systems. Little</seg><seg type="columnLine">America, the tiny settlement and expedition base on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the east shore of the Ross Sea, had rapidly grown into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thriving port with facilities for handling and trans-ship-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping the ore. New Sidney, a unique semi-underground</seg><seg type="columnLine">city had been created at the mine head--transport prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lems had been met and solved with amazing ingenuity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And by the time Hamilton graduated with honors from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colorado School of Mines, the pioneering had all been</seg><seg type="columnLine">done:--another ore field had been discovered, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">international metallurgical corporation of Berne had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized that for development.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOW all this was commonplace--and Hamilton was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only an unusually young assistant corporation</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemist making a quick trip to the mine. Life was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trifle monotonous nowadays. If only one of the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thordarson turbines would fail, and bring them limping</seg><seg type="columnLine">into port! Or if a terrible polar blizzard would shriek</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the southwest and resist furiously every inch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their progress. But no, those oil turbines could roar at</seg><seg type="columnLine">top speed for seven hundred hours and never miss a</seg><seg type="columnLine">power cycle; while as for storms, the meteorological</seg><seg type="columnLine">service warned of them long in advance, and they howled</seg><seg type="columnLine">out their furies through empty skies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Or what if bandits should attack the plane! After all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">big interests were involved in this trip. If International</seg><seg type="columnLine">Met. had somehow gotten wind of the new refining</seg><seg type="columnLine">method, and had put secret agents on his trail... Pshaw!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was imagining an old-fashioned melodrama, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret interests and sabotage and all the rest of it. Ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citing if true--but, after all, the scenery below was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty inhospitable, and it was pleasanter to think about</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventure here than to undergo it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A glance at his watch showed the plane an hour and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quarter out from Little America. In fifteen or twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes more they were due at New Sidney. No sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of civilization yet--only the jagged, crevassed expanse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary Byrd Land slipped by below. He wondered how</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would fare if the radio beacon down whose in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">groove they were heading, should suddenly cease. As-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tronomical navigation in these parts was extraordinarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult, and the magnetic compass very unreliable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly his attention was focussed on a tiny black</seg><seg type="columnLine">dot on the snow field far below and to the right. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot evidently had seen it too, for the plane swerved</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trifle and began a long sweeping glide. The dot grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger and larger, grew into a beetle--a monstrous black</seg><seg type="columnLine">beetle crawling over the white surface. It dawned on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hamilton that this formidable bug was one of the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">freight tractors operating between Little America and</seg><seg type="columnLine">New Sidney. Now he could see the famous Arlington</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tractor Route, the hard packed lane winding its way</seg><seg type="columnLine">back north and west one hundred miles through tortuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rhyker Pass in the Charles Bob Mountains. Here, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a series of hairpin loops and turns, it dropped seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet to the level of Ross Barrier, whence it</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned almost north and drove towards Little America</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the comparatively level surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were now only a few hundred feet above the'</seg><seg type="columnLine">tractor; Hamilton could see and appreciate its vast bulk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fully eighty feet long and fifteen feet high--it relent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly clanked its way forward like some ponderous pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">historic monster. Its great driving wheels revolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">majestically, carrying their caterpillar treads, whose six</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot plates crunched and bit into the packed snow sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face with irresistible force. The whole atmosphere in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the region of this vast machine trembled with the exhaust</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar of its turbines, the earth quaked under its giant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tread. Hamilton noticed the row of steel hatches down</seg><seg type="columnLine">its back where the ore from the mines was loaded in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and another row along one side from which the ore</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured out at the discharging station in Little America.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Up at the "bow" was a small deck-house terminating in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a glass enclosed control room. As the plane swooped</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, a window opened and an arm reached out to wave</seg><seg type="columnLine">a greeting. The pilot acknowledged it and the turbines</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the airplane resumed their hum. Upward they swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a long climb which soon reduced the great tractor to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the size of an insignificant crawling ant. So these were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mighty steel monsters which hauled the produce of</seg><seg type="columnLine">New Sidney to the outer world!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The atmosphere, which had so far been clear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparkling, was becoming slightly hazy. The snow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered land below grew rapidly indistinct in a fog</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which the sun gleamed with a dull white pallor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet the pilot seemed not at all dismayed by the lack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">visibility. His echo altimeter gave him his exact height</seg><seg type="columnLine">above ground, while the radio beacon held him rigidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the course. In fact, the automatic helmsman, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which these planes were equipped, frequently took charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the whole trip. Hamilton noted with relief that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were now under automatic control, for with the coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fog the pilot had thrown in the "iron mike" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was leaning back in his seat gazing out of the window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly a tiny green light glowed on the instrument</seg><seg type="columnLine">board. The pilot opened a little window into the passen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger compartment and called back to Hamilton--"We've</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up the high frequency sound beacon from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field. Our receptor is holding us right in the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">SOUTH POLAR BERYLLIUM, LIMITED</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">419</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the beam which slants down to the field at the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">gliding angle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he spoke, the roar of the propellers died away to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a purr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It even throttles the motors at the proper altitude--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord! In calm weather like this the pilot might as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">curl up and go to sleep after the take-off. There's noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing else he has to do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two parallel red glowing tracks appeared in the fog</seg><seg type="columnLine">below them--the neon landing guides laid even with or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little below the surface of the flying field. The plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled lightly between them, rolled a hundred yards and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to a stop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Mine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE surface of the flying field stretched away</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimly into the mist. At its edges could be seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vague bulk of low snow-covered buildings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pilot pointed ahead to one of them. "The hangars</seg><seg type="columnLine">--we'll taxi inside and unload there--we never do any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing outside here if we can help it. Too cold!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they approached the building, a low, wide door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way opened and the plane slid smoothly into the lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and warmed interior. They came to rest in line with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen planes of similar type--light mail and passenger</seg><seg type="columnLine">carriers. Hamilton climbed out of the cabin, grip in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. The baggage compartment had already been</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened, and attendants were hurling mail sacks into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little electric truck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood irresolute for a moment till he spied a stocky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-faced little man hurrying towards him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're Hamilton, the new assistant chemist? I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pat McIntyre, general super here. Mighty glad to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Mr. Hamilton--I've heard a good deal about you</seg><seg type="columnLine">from headquarters. Come along and I'll show you</seg><seg type="columnLine">your rooms. I guess you'd like to wash up a bit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little man talking volubly led the way. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't much above ground here--just these hangars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with official quarters and offices at the north end of them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a few miscellaneous buildings, ventilating stacks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">freight elevator outlets, and so on. There's not much ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage in outside exposure here--the view is sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">monotonous, even if it happens to be a clear day, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's too hard to keep the buildings warm and clear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow. Well here we are."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had passed through several concrete floored pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sageways and entered a small bedroom with a window</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening on the flying field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My room is right around the corner--in fact most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the officers live on this floor. The mess hall, lounge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so on are on the ground floor. Also the offices--</seg><seg type="columnLine">what there are of them. Mine, the field metallurgist's,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the transportation engineer's, the chief mining engineer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a few others. A fancy lot of titles, but they're a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good bunch. Come on down as soon as you're ready."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hamilton examined his room. It was of concrete with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tiled floor--all fireproof construction. The outer wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the window embrasure pierced it, was at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">two and a half feet thick, made of reinforced concrete</seg><seg type="columnLine">and double thickness of hollow tile for insulation. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">window itself was of triple glass permanently set in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Near the floor he noticed a small grated opening. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">current of pleasantly warmed air was flowing into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. The building seemed admirably constructed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">withstand the rigors of the antarctic climate. Presently</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he became aware of a dull murmur and pulsation which</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted up the ventilating duct and permeated the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosphere, like the throb of engines, which is always</seg><seg type="columnLine">present on shipboard. It was the voice of the mine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mingled vibrations of all the great machines inces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">santly at work in the depths below. All this was new</seg><seg type="columnLine">and intensely interesting to the young chemist; he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked so far only at the refining plant in Melbourne</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had no opportunity to visit New Sidney. He an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticipated with pleasure his trip through the mine with</seg><seg type="columnLine">McIntyre. It would certainly be unique, like no mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had ever seen before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sudden roar from outside, which penetrated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">triple glass windows, attracted his attention. A great</seg><seg type="columnLine">door had opened in one of the distant buildings. Nosing</seg><seg type="columnLine">its way outward, like a gigantic blind mammoth, was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the freight tractors of the sort they had passed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain. He watched while its skipper jockeyed it through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the portal with great roaring spurts of its port or star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board turbine. At last it was outside, the door slid</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut and the vast machine lumbered off westward</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the mist for its three-hundred-mile trek to Little</seg><seg type="columnLine">America.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McIntyre was busy looking over some reports as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hamilton entered his office. "Have a seat," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There won't be time to look over the works before</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunch, so I thought we could pass the hour profitably in</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation." He hitched his chair to a more com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortable angle and drew out a smoke-blackened brier</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I understand from a letter which I received yesterday</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the chief that you are down here on fairly im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant business. Naturally I am mighty curious to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear what you have to say--though to be frank, I think I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a good idea of what you'll talk about. Tell me</seg><seg type="columnLine">now--you have some plan for cutting down on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of our ore shipment to Little America--isn't that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right you are," assented Hamilton, "but I don't see</seg><seg type="columnLine">how you knew it. That's all supposed to be a deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing to it! If you'd been in this outfit as long as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have and gone to every blessed yearly board meeting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where old Frobisher invariably comes down like a ton</seg><seg type="columnLine">of brick on Saunders (he's our transportation man here)</seg><seg type="columnLine">because his bloomin' little tractors run up too big an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pense account--you'd know what the old man is worry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about. I know it's the overland haul that eats into</seg><seg type="columnLine">our profits. The worst of it is that seventy-five percent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cargo is worthless--slags out in the furnaces at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Melbourne.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know that's the problem Earl Strauber was work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on. The old man put a lot of store by him--and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen to know that he was pretty hard hit when Strau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber went bad and had to be fired for misappropriation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of funds. Naturally Frobisher looked for a man to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinue the work and picked you, for your success with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pyrargyrite ores at the Gila mines. And by the look</seg><seg type="columnLine">in your eye, I'd say that maybe you've figured this thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">out! Am I right?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's about it!" laughed Hamilton, "you seem to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite a Sherlock Holmes. I never knew that there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">any scandal connected with Strauber's disappearance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, sure--he was a bad egg--I never liked him--met</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a couple of times when he came down to look the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine over. They do say he was a dam' good metallurgist.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">420</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord, you never can tell what a man will do." He fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent puffing at his stubby pipe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hamilton was unbuckling the straps of his brief case.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took out a package of typed pages and blueprints</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tossed it on the desk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "McIntyre--that's a batch of papers that is going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause you some sleepless nights during the next year or</seg><seg type="columnLine">so. They are the tentative plans for the installation here</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an experimental forced-field ionic separator for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reduction of beryllium and aluminium metasilicates to</seg><seg type="columnLine">beryllium oxide."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The superintendent looked keenly at Hamilton. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">name of that apparatus is mighty impressive, but its</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange to me. If it can do that little trick in a way that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can manage here--I begin to understand what Fro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bisher meant when he said you were coming here on</seg><seg type="columnLine">important business."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly. There is no necessity for enlarging on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">value of this method of refining. With it we can, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">purely chemical and electrical apparatus, produce fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">pure beryllium oxide at the mine head. No heat or fuel</seg><seg type="columnLine">is required. The apparatus uses only water as a solvent</seg><seg type="columnLine">and electric current to set up certain fields of force. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">give you a brief idea of how the thing works. It's my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own brain-child and naturally I'm rather proud of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course, the metasilicate is normally insoluble. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">make use of any of the ordinary chemical operations</seg><seg type="columnLine">which are not accompanied by combustion or similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">violent reactions, it is necessary to have the reacting</seg><seg type="columnLine">materials in solution and in an ionized state. Accord-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly, I have worked on the problem of forcing solution</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ionization in normally insoluble substances. Tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing my cue from the known effect of ultra-violet light and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the various other ionizing agents, and also working with</seg><seg type="columnLine">alternating high-frequency electrostatic fields, I suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded in developing a projector, which, in conjunction</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a field of proper frequency and intensity, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">first shatter the suspended crystals of the ore into their</seg><seg type="columnLine">component molecules and would then break up those</seg><seg type="columnLine">molecules into their component ions. (Bear with me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacIntyre!)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Having dissolved and ionized the compound, it is then</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary to differentiate between the ions, as it were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">'pick out' the ions which we want to combine again into</seg><seg type="columnLine">new compounds, remove them from the ionizing field,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then allow them to unite. By proper placing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrodes, it is possible to separate the positive and</seg><seg type="columnLine">negative ions, and by an application of the principle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the molecular resonance apparatus used in ore prospect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, I shield each electrode from all ions but those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain mass." He smiled at MacIntyre's look of patient</seg><seg type="columnLine">resignation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What all this boils down to can be expressed in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">equation." He took up a piece of paper and wrote:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Al3Be3(Si08)6-f9H20^ 3BeO| +2Al(OH)s t</seg><seg type="columnLine">+6H2SiOs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In ordinary chemistry that is an impossible equation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It just wouldn't work. But by the proper application</seg><seg type="columnLine">of force I can make it work. The products separate</seg><seg type="columnLine">out at different electrodes and have no opportunity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">recombine except as we choose. So we have nothing but</seg><seg type="columnLine">beryllium oxide to ship--a fraction of the weight you</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry at present--to say nothing of the simplification of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the refining process.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have worked out the practical application of this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">method with Hardman at the Melbourne plant. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been successfully operating one of the units for six</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks now. Hardman has also made a series of tenta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive plans for the installation of the apparatus here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These I have brought down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Obviously the new unit must be operated as part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ore-dressing department. As it requires finely di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided material for proper operation, we decided to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">the discharge from your concentrating tables, which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the metasilicate pretty well purified and granulated. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, if the process entirely supplants the fused-ore</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrolytic works at Melbourne, we'll run all the ore</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the grinders and pulverizers, then through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hydraulic separators and concentrators so as to get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniform product. And I guess that's about the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">story--except that I want you to check over these plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">and routing schedules. In them I've given you all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dope about the dimensions, the hourly capacity of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine, and the necessary hydraulic and electric con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nections. Everything is there but the 'insides' which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we're keeping as a company secret. It's rather risky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but we hope to keep our advantage over International</seg><seg type="columnLine">Met. longer than the few years of patent protection."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well," said MacIntyre as he rose and knocked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashes out of his pipe, "I can see where I'm in for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretch of hard work whipping a brand-new process into</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape to meet practical conditions. Gosh! When I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of some of the sessions with dumb shop foremen--</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to mention annual third degrees in front of dumber</seg><seg type="columnLine">boards of directors--but it'll be worth it! Let's be</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting to lunch. Afterwards I guess you'd like to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">a look around." He placed the plans in a drawer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his desk and locked it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Subterranean Industry</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE "mess hall" was a spacious, airy room, well</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit by large triple glass windows and colite tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">set in the ceiling. Hamilton enjoyed the meal;</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of the men were old timers who had tales to tell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the founding of New Sidney, of the difficulties and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hazards that the pioneers underwent. He heard descrip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of forced landings hundreds of miles from civili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zation, of lost motor-sleds wandering for days in un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">explored canyons and mountain passes; grisly tales of</seg><seg type="columnLine">frozen corpses and unsolved mysteries. Those must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been the days!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After lunch, MacIntyre announced that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">spare the afternoon and was ready to accompany Ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ilton on a tour of inspection. "First," he said, "I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">you ought to see our power plant. It's the heart of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole establishment, of course. And it's not deep, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we btiilt it right at the start."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They went down a concrete stairway to the first level,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was just beneath the surface. After traversing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few colite-illuminated corridors, they entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamo room--long and low, with rows of squat direct-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coupled Tesla turbines and alternators. The walls were</seg><seg type="columnLine">paneled with switchboards and meters which fluctuated</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly with the varying loads on the innumerable mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">motors. A few attendants were present; otherwise the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only indications of the tremendous force generated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this room was the high pitched whine of the turbine discs</seg><seg type="columnLine">spinning at terrific speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These are operating at fifteen hundred pounds pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure and I forgot what temperature," MacIntyre in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">SOUTH POLAR BERYLLIUM, LIMITED</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">421</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">formed Hamilton, "but it's so high that the blades have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be made of aranium. We have to give credit to you</seg><seg type="columnLine">metallurgists for developing alloys like that!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As to our power source--I suppose you know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have here one of the seven existing Starbuck thermo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">borings ... a six-mile shaft tapping the earth's internal</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat. These are practicable only in very rare circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances, when the cost of fuel is absolutely prohibitive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd hate to figure out how much this boring cost us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We sank it with a modified Starbuck teredo, powered</seg><seg type="columnLine">by short range radio beam. We disliked using such an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inefficient method of power transmission, but five or</seg><seg type="columnLine">six miles of power cable hanging straight down is quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">a load. You'll see some of our big teredos at work later</seg><seg type="columnLine">on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They crossed the dynamo room and entered a concrete</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber beyond. The great steam manifold from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbines led into this room and passed through a formid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able series of regulating valves to the head of an eighteen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch pipe. This was the main which drove six miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into the earth to tap its limitless sources of heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and energy. MacIntyre pointed out the smaller pipe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which passed down within the steam line and supplied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water to be vaporized by the high temperature. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">the piping was heavily heat insulated, yet the chamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">was exceedingly hot, and it seemed to Hamilton as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air was quivering from the terrific tension of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">confined steam. He felt as if they were standing over</seg><seg type="columnLine">an immense boiler which might blow up at any moment;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was great relief to leave the valve chamber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We use the exhaust from the turbines to heat all our</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings," said the superintendent. "Of course the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">levels of the mine need no heating, the surface tempera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture has no effect down there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Adjoining the dynamo room was the fan room; here</seg><seg type="columnLine">great rotary blowers drew air in from forty-foot stacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">above ground, warmed it over coils heated by exhaust</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam, and sent it through ducts to all parts of the mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and buildings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next they visited the "residential section" of the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Subterranean town, the main "street" of which was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially wide corridor flanked by dormitories, recrea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion halls, a general store, a television and movie theater,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eating halls--in fact all of the necessaries and many of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the luxuries of life. Everywhere the colite tubes shed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their radiance, a pleasant illumination which closely ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proximated sunlight. The air was kept fresh and mild</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the ventilating system.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the other side of town was the "factory district."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here were extensiye mechanical and electrical shops for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the maintenance of mine machinery, of the ore tractors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of the company planes. Here also was the ore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressing department--a series of great halls, filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">massive pulverizing machines, sizing machines, hydraulic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and centrifugal classifiers, and concentrating tables--</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of the apparatus for preparing the ore for the actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">refining. The ore was received at one end of this series</seg><seg type="columnLine">of machines as a mixture of beryl and granite pegmatites</seg><seg type="columnLine">*--the latter chiefly quartz and feldspar, and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">traversing it, emerged as fairly pure aluminum beryllium</seg><seg type="columnLine">metasilicate ready to be shipped. The ore dressing de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partment was an inferno of noise, but even here the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air was quite pure, as all the machines which handled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ore dry were enclosed completely and their "fines,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">or rock dust, were removed pneumatically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The final product was conveyed to loading hoppers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in an adjoining department. Under these the freight</seg><seg type="columnLine">tractors received their cargoes, which they carried up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ramp to the great doorway Hamilton had seen from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his window. Besides the tractors, there were a num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of cargo sledges to be towed by the more powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll have to excavate rooms here somewhere for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new machines," MacIntyre shouted into his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion's ear against the roar and rumble of falling ore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes--Hardman figured you could make it by digging</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the south end of the hall!" the metallurgist roared</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. "Let's get out of here and go down into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">workings!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They followed the great endless chain ore-conveyors</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the head of the main shaft and were dropped five</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet in the cage with qualmish speed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft was double, and provided for the operation of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cage, an ore hoist, and for the great main ventilating</seg><seg type="columnLine">duct, hydraulic mains, and electric power cables.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stopped opposite a deep shelf cut into the shaft</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. The six-foot mouth of a circular concrete lined</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel yawned opposite them. Several large power</seg><seg type="columnLine">cables, a branch from the hydraulic main and one from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ventilating duct vanished into it. A flexible tube,</seg><seg type="columnLine">about eighteen inches in diameter, also led out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel and ended in an ore hopper. From its mouth* at</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhythmic intervals, a slushy mass of ore and water</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured into the hopper. This Hamilton recognized as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ingenious "peristaltic conveyor," a device for con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veying semi-liquid materials by the same alternate con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traction and expansion of its wails that carries food</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the aesophagus and intestine of the animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">system. It was built of a series of sliding rings operated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by powerful solenoids. Current impulses were supplied</seg><seg type="columnLine">to these solenoids, in the proper order to produce the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peristaltic motion, by a simple commutator, which cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">responded to a ganglion of the nervous system. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole tube was enclosed in a heavy flexible coating for</seg><seg type="columnLine">protection. Altogether it was a very ingenious solution</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the problem of transportation of crushed material,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it could easily be laid around corners and through</seg><seg type="columnLine">constricted areas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two men picked their way along the tunnel towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">its head. At first the gurgling and scraping of ore were</seg><seg type="columnLine">audible in the conveyor, but as. they advanced it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowned out by an ear-splitting grinding roar from</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead. At last they reached the tunnel-head and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">source of the racket--a "teredo" tunneler. Here was</seg><seg type="columnLine">another machine, for which nature had furnished the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiration. Like the little mollusc, its namesake, it bored</seg><seg type="columnLine">its way slowly forward, and as it progressed, lined its</seg><seg type="columnLine">burrow with a strong quick-setting concrete.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For b, while they stood at the rear watching the slow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">irresistible progress of the mass of mechanism. A con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinuous stream of ground ore spouted from an opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its back, was mixed with water, and dropped into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">maw of the peristaltic conveyor. Extra lengths of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubing were stacked to one side, coils of electric cable</seg><seg type="columnLine">were under foot, and puddles from the leaking water</seg><seg type="columnLine">joints gleamed in the dim tunnel lighting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They entered the rear operating compartment, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like the inside of an early submarine. Here an</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer was regulating the apparatus which mixed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">concrete and which exuded it in viscous stream from</seg><seg type="columnLine">openings around the rear of the machine. Farther for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward were the controls for the driving mechanism--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">422</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">powerful motors which rotated the outer shell with its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">screw threads of lambda-tungsten carbide. The whole</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">front was filled by the motors that drove the synthetic-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">diamond tipped cutters which ground their way steadily</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into the rock ahead. They vibrated like an electric mas-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sagist and the grinding roar from the cutters made even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thinking, much less talking, almost impossible. After</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a few minutes Hamilton could stand it no longer and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">retreated back along the tunnel. MacIntyre followed,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mopping his brow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The men who operate those devilish machines are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the highest paid mechanics we have. They sure deserve</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what they get!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I can understand where all the power from those</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">turbines goes," said Hamilton as they walked back to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the shaft. "Those contraptions must use a terrific</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">amount."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Yes, one teredo requires about three thousand horse</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> power. We couldn't build motors to deliver that power</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and still take up so little room if we didn't use super-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> malloy for the armatures and field cores. It's also used</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> in the solenoids of the peristaltics."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  By the time they reached the mine head and made</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their way back to MacIntyre's office, it was time for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the evening meal. The mist outside was almost as light</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as when Hamilton arrived, for it was December, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the sun was not yet dipping below the horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   After supper Hamilton talked further with the super-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> intendent concerning the new plans. MacIntyre prom-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ised to send them back to Melbourne in a week's time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> with whatever modifications he or his staff found neces-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> sary. The chemist turned in early as he planned to take</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the mail plane that left for Little America at five-thirty</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> • in the morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ON the morning of the day after he left New Sidney,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Hamilton arrived in Melbourne. He had had a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">three-hour wait in Little America between connections</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which he had spent in seeing the sights of this unusual</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">port. It was then at the height of its season of activity,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the pack had broken and the powerful ice-breaking ore</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vessels were plowing their way into the Bay of Whales</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to pick up their cargoes of ore and buffet their way</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">northward. The great stores of ore, which the freight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tractors had been piling up during the months when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the port had been icebound, were diminishing. The town</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was perpetually noisy with the clatter of ore loaders</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">poking their steel snouts into the holds of the dock</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vessels, with the clank and roar of incoming tractors,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the more musical tones of the motors of arriving</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or departing freight dirigibles and passenger liners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   At thirteen o'clock the Melbourne de luxe flyer took</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> off with Hamilton on board. He passed the monotonous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> hours of daylight over the grey south Pacific reading</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and working on ideas for the new ionic separator, his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> favorite brain-child. Towards dusk the weather became</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a bit too heavy for writing. He switched off his reading</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> light and gazed out of the cabin porthole into darkening</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> cloud wracks scudding by. Far below gleamed the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> lights of a vessel--probably one of the S. P. B. ore</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> fleet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At twenty-two o'clock, after a light supper and a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">glance at the television news service, he went to bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The air was rather bumpy and the big plane rode un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">easily, so he snapped the safety belt across his narrow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">berth before he dropped off to sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some time later he was aroused by the cessation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the motor hum and vibration. Water was lapping</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the hull and outside the dark porthole, lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">were flashing and voices murmuring. This was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop-over in Ivercargill at the southern tip of New Zea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, for refueling and motor checking. He knew it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be long before daybreak, but they were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">due to arrive before mid-morning, so he turned over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to sleep again, while the great plane winged its</seg><seg type="columnLine">way steadily westward across the New Zealand sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Preparations</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HAMILTON spent over a month after his return</seg><seg type="columnLine">from New Sidney in making ready the commer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cial unit of his ionic separator for transportation</seg><seg type="columnLine">and insulation at the mine. The difficulties were increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly by the necessity for secrecy. He and the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gineer, Hardman, were forced to arrange for the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction of vital parts at different electrical shops and</seg><seg type="columnLine">together they assembled them. At the same time they</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept in communication with MacIntyre, who had checked</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the installation plans and was proceeding with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary enlargements and construction of auxiliary</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus. As the winter was approaching, and it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon be impossible to get in by ship to Little America,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hamilton speeded up his preparations as much as</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By February sixth, thanks to an extra appropriation</seg><seg type="columnLine">made by the board of directors, the first industrial</seg><seg type="columnLine">size ionic separator was completed and had been stowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the freight hold of the Vulcan, one of the fastest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and newest ore carriers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And early next morning the powerful craft dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">her pilot off Point Nepean and turned her armoured</seg><seg type="columnLine">prow stubbornly into the great grey seas of the roaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">forties. For four days the Vulcan, in ballast, wobbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and butted her way southward and eastward. Hamil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton spent most of this time with the ship's officers on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enclosed main bridge, in the officer's mess, sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">up on the open flying bridge with the wind and spray</seg><seg type="columnLine">splashing against his oilskins, or down in the engine</seg><seg type="columnLine">room where the immense oil turbines roared in captivity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He enjoyed the trip immensely, in spite of the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had to hang on to something whenever he wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain upright; repeatedly he was rolled out of his berth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for one horrible morning was helpless in the grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mal de tner. These tough ore carriers were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipped with any such luxuries as gyroscopic stabilizers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She drove relentlessly on at her moderate thirty knots</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on the fifth day the wind having blown itself out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they entered the realm of floating ice. Here speed was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reduced to twelve knots, extra lookouts were posted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and an officer was always on duty at the "iceberg indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cator." This instrument was essentially an exceedingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicate horizontally acting balance which responded</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the attraction of any mass great enough to be dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerous within a range of several miles. Of course, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vulcan was an ice-breaker, and with her tough alloy</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel ribs and plating could stand a lot of beating. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ram any of the huge flat-topped icebergs which</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes appeared in these waters would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">injudicious, to say the least!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After twenty hours of this cautious progress they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came within sight of the magnificent rugged sea-face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Ross Barrier. In another hour they were entering</seg><seg type="columnLine">SOUTH POLAR BERYLLIUM, LIMITED</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">423</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Bay of Whales, to the sound of splitting ice slabs</seg><seg type="columnLine">shattered by the Vulcan's sharp prow. The snow-laden</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings of Little America came into view, clustered</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the edge of the white shore line. By the water's edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the docks cut into the barrier itself, each with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">black ore-handling machinery beside it; farther inland</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be seen the dirigible mooring mast with a cluster</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hangars near by. A ship lay in one of the basins;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roar of her loading with ore accompanied the shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of orders and the clatter of winches as the Vulcan</seg><seg type="columnLine">docked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Over the Tractor Trail</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE freight tractor Boanergesy having delivered</seg><seg type="columnLine">her ore, had been ordered to stand by to receive the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vulcan's consignment of machinery. Hamilton</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched with interest the transfer of his crated and</seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas-covered separator from the hold of the sea-going</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel to that of the land vessel. A powerful electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">crane dropped a cable down into the Vulcan where slings</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been rigged; silently and smoothly the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of delicate machinery rose, swung in an arc, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was swallowed without a jar by the open number one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatch of the Boanerges. Her skipper, a likable and</seg><seg type="columnLine">efficient young man, stood by supervising the stowage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">^nder his orders the job was done in an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He explained to Hamilton, "I am anxious to start</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as possible. We have been having unnaturally</seg><seg type="columnLine">good weather, and I want to be well on my way before</seg><seg type="columnLine">it cracks. If we can get through the Pass before then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll be satisfied."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hamilton accepted the hint and soon climbed the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel ladder leading to the topsides of the Boanerges.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The greater part of the flat deck was taken up by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a row of five steel loading hatches. Forward was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">low deckhouse terminating in a rounded glass control</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. A small sturdy door opened on either side to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior. He entered to deposit his suitcase and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in a narrow longitudinal corridor. Forward it</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened into the control room--aft was a steel stairway</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading down--presumably to the engine room. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">small rooms flanking the entrance way opened off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">port side--the galley and washroom; on the starboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one larger compartment. Doubtless the "officer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon," thought Hamilton, as it boasted leather uphol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stered benches against the wall. Heavy glass ports il-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminated all the rooms except the control room, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was provided with wide vision windows. The whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was an odd combination of the atmospheres of</seg><seg type="columnLine">land and sea travel.-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sounds of activity were drifting up from the engine</seg><seg type="columnLine">room--the clinking of metal and murmuring of voices.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A muffled throbbing of pumps resounded through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabins; then a loud stuttering hiss--the air starters</seg><seg type="columnLine">were spinning the turbines. A few preliminary coughs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spurts and the Boanerges vibrated gently with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep rumbling exhaust of her idling engines. Outside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the closing of the hatches was about completed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipper came running nimbly up the side followed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">another young man in the company uniform.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Mr. Hamilton, meet Mr. Fellows, our radio operator</seg><seg type="columnLine">and electrical man. If you have any questions he'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad to answer 'em--you'll excuse me for a while--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have to take charge now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He entered the control room and sat down in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot's seat. Before him were the throttle and reversing</seg><seg type="columnLine">levers for the port and starboard turbines, the clutch</seg><seg type="columnLine">control, and the revolving pointer of the "ratio control"</seg><seg type="columnLine">which varied uniformly the number of revolutions which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the turbines made to each revolution of the drive wheels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the minimum setting, or "high," with open throttle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Boanerges could make about nineteen miles an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour on the level. At the maximum setting, her tractive</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort was terrific. The use of turbines in this field</seg><seg type="columnLine">was made possible by the famous Voight transmission,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which provided positive mechanical connection between</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine and drive wheel, and at the same time allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drive ratio to be uniformly varied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke into the engine room telephone: "Are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready below, Mr. Frazer?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye, aye!" came back the answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the ratio control at maximum, the skipper opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throttles and slowly let in the clutch. Hamilton</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the increased roar of motors, felt the first lurch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the floor. He looked out a window--a few muffled-</seg><seg type="columnLine">up bystanders were watching them--they passed out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">range as the Boanerges heaved forward. The ratio</seg><seg type="columnLine">was decreased, the throttle was opened a trifle more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they lumbered with increasing speed up the packed</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail, which led back from the little settlement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll have to stop at the roundhouse to pick up an</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty trailer." Fellows raised his voice against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drumming of the exhaust and the clanking of the treads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The roundhouse and shops for the tractors lay about</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a mile back from the town. Around them was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great area of snow, packed and churned with grease</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the continual maneuvering of the machines. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">trailer was ready for them, Hamilton watched the skip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per as he skilfully backed into it so that the automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">couplings clicked with no help from the ground crew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once again they started--this time with the empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">trailer lurching after on its six-foot runners. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed ahead at the trail vanishing into the distance across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barren snow-covered barrier, Hamilton felt a thrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the others, hardened antarctic travelers, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to notice. The sky was heavy with rolling grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds. A few snowflakes drifted down. He walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the rear porthole and looked out. The last buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Little America were out of sight, the Boanerges had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become a tiny center of human achievement in the midst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a vast dcadness of nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hamilton went down the steel stairway to the crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">noisy engine room. He quickly made the acquaintance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the chief engineer, Mr. Frazer, and his assistant who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were glad to show and explain the mechanism. The low</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel-arched room was divided in the center by a runway</seg><seg type="columnLine">with handrails. On each side were the long cylindrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">main turbines, terminating in massive clutch-cases and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Voight transmission housings, from which the drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">shafts led to the rear worm-gears. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">monotonous beat as in the engine room of a ship, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speed of the turbines was always varying in obedience</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the throttle as the skipper worked the huge machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">over bad spots in the trail or around crevasses and ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stacles in the route. When Hamilton commented on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this to Frazer, the old engineer told him to come down</seg><seg type="columnLine">while they were negotiating the Pass if he wanted to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skipper playing the Anvil Chorus on the turbines and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Voights. "It'll fairly shake the teeth out of your head</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stand on that runway then--that is, if you're able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand up at all," he concluded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">424</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the chemist returned to the deck house an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, it had grown perceptibly darker and snow was</seg><seg type="columnLine">whipping by the ports with a lively breeze behind it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fellows was at his instrument and was just speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the skipper as he entered the control room: "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cerberus is about five and a quarter miles ahead, Sir;</seg><seg type="columnLine">she's making about thirteen miles."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The skipper nodded. "Take another reading in ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, and after that keep a check on her till visibility.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We've got to be cautious in this weather." He peered</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead into the shifting veil of snow. "I guess I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch to.cable control--can't see much out and the trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">is beginning to drift over."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He put on a pair of headphones while Fellows ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained to Hamilton: "There's a cable carrying one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred cycle alternating current laid under the trail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We are equipped with a coil below that picks up the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulse, and all you have to do is to keep the sound in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the phone at a maximum intensity, and you stick on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail." -</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned to his range finder to take another reading</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the distance of the approaching freighter. This in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strument was a modified directional ultra-short wave</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmitter and receiver with which all company tractors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">were equipped. It operated on exactly the same principle</seg><seg type="columnLine">as military range finders except that it utilized extremely</seg><seg type="columnLine">short radio waves instead of light waves. The instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment indicated now that the Cerberus was only two miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead. Accordingly they proceeded at reduced speed till</seg><seg type="columnLine">a light gleamed through the falling snow and rapidly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved itself into the dazzling headlight of the other ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine. With a thunderous roar its snow-covered bulk</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed and was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR several hours they continued the monotonous</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress southward. Hamilton retired to the saloon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tried to read, but everything jiggled too much for</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfort, so he went into the little electric galley and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed himself a cup of hot coffee and a sandwich. Oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casional glances through the port revealed an ever dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening landscape and an increase in the strength of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind until a regular antarctic blizzard was howling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieking around the Boanerges. It was impossible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see more than twenty or thirty feet; they were navigating</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely by cable piloting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Late in the evening the odometer registered ninety miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Little America. The route swerved easterly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to climb--this was the start of Rhyker Pass, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrated the Charles Bob Mountains at a maximum</seg><seg type="columnLine">altitude of nine thousand feet. The roar of the exhausts</seg><seg type="columnLine">became a little deeper as the skipper advanced the throt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle and increased the drive ratio. Hamilton went for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward into the control room, dark but for the glimmer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few instruments. The powerful headlight bored ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a shaft of brilliant light, which was soon lost in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the almost horizontal drive of small dry snowflakes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gradually the slope became greater, the engines were</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to labor. Shadowy cliffs were closing in on</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side, the route began to twist and serpentine. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">headlight dimly picked out black, piled up masses of rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweeping out into the night--the base ribs of the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains through which they picked their way. The tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuous route kept the skipper on the alert, as with skilful</seg><seg type="columnLine">manipulation of the throttle and ratio levers he jockeyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the huge tractor through winding canyons, around hair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pin turns, always following the sinuosity of the trail</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as it fought its way upward. Suddenly he threw out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutches and flicked off the throttle; the roar of the tur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bines died and left a silence broken by the whistling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's up ?" ejaculated Fellows from his seat before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the radio instrument.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The cable note has stopped!" The skipper took off</seg><seg type="columnLine">his phones and handed them over; they were silent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a momentary pause, as the two men looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioningly at each other.

A foolish, nameless fear; for what beast or</seg><seg type="columnLine">entity hostile to man existed in these barren regions!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The grim antarctic was a jealous enemy, it neither per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted nor required allies or rivals in its cruel war</seg><seg type="columnLine">against mankind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For an hour more they continued their tortuous up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward progress. The skipper was unusually alert for</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs of danger--perhaps a snow slide across their path,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a break in some bridge or fill which carried the trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">across a bad spot. But nothing out of the way happened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except perhaps, when he half turned in his seat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered to Hamilton: "I could have sworn that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thunderstone Cut we just passed through--and if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was we ought to be turning about fifteen degrees easterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">right now--but I'll trust the cable before I trust my eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this weather." .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The route was becoming more and more uneven and</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult; the snow in the pass through which they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">progressing seemed to have drifted to an unusual depth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Boanerges heaved and pitched violently, her engines</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring at full blast as she nosed and fought her way</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward.

Like despairing souls the turbines shrieked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in crescendo up from the engine room. The skipper had</seg><seg type="columnLine">released the clutches but had been hurled from his seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he could turn off the power. The shriek died</seg><seg type="columnLine">away to silence as the automatic over-speed relays came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three men untangled themselves from the heap</seg><seg type="columnLine">SOUTH POLAR BERYLLIUM, LIMITED</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">425</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">into which they had been hurled.

I'm going outside to look over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation." He snatched up a powerful electric hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantern and hurried aft through the main corridor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the sloping deck to the port entrance way. A gust</seg><seg type="columnLine">of snow and chill swooped in as he stepped out, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy door clanged shut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hamilton could see the flash of his lantern through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ports as he made his way forward along the narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck which ran on either side of the deckhouse. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">muffled form swung over the side by the boarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladder and passed out of sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inside the great stranded machine there was silence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken intermittently by the clink and scrape of metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the occasional whirr of motors as the crew tested ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus for breakage. Hamilton was in the control room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividing his attention between the radio man tinkering</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his equipment and the murk outside, in an attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make out the skipper's light. It winked and flickered</seg><seg type="columnLine">below under the great tilted hull of the Boanerges. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched, fascinated, through the observation window.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The light moved slowly aft as the skipper examined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition of the immense caterpillar treads. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tiny beam swung about, flashed crazily. A jet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame pierced the darkness beside it, accompanied by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint report, which reached his ears through the thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass. The lamp flew upward in a glittering arc to fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">and extinguish itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hamilton leaped away from the window, a cry of</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning on his lips; but the same instant a staccato</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapping on the glass arrested him. He spun around and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked--a figure muffled in snow whitened packa was</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing outside, a Kruf automatic in its mittened hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">covering the two men within. Hamilton stared, frozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">with astonishment, but Fellows dashed to his radio tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone. Instantly the automatic blazed and the whole in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strument panel burst in a sheet of flame where the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosive bullet struck it. The lights blinked out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hamilton dashed in the direction of the corridor to es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cape the murderous fire through the observation window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little light was gleaming through the engine room</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion way aft; he leapt towards it in a frantic effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get out of the way of the next shot. Simultaneously</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man stepped into the corridor from the side entrance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hamilton crashed into him and clutched wildly. His im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petus carried the two men over the edge and they hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the iron ladder into the depths of the Boanerges</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowling over Frazer, who had just started up to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestigate the shooting. They landed at the bottom, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearful scramble of arms and legs, Frazer, enraged at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unreasonable assault and Hamilton, almost out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">running from the battering and the pain in his wrist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bandits!" he croaked, as he got dizzily to his feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They shot the skipper when he went outside--and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think they got Fellows!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This one of them?" snapped out Frazer, leaning over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the third man who sprawled out on the steel floor, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gainly in his heavy furs. He had been knocked un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey, Tom," he called to his assistant, "lock up this</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow in the store-room when he comes to.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">two crept up the steel ladder and poked their heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously above the corridor deck. Immediately they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dazzled by the beam of a powerful electric torch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while a gruff voice ordered them to "git below and stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">below." By way of hastening their descent a Quinn air</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol sighed somewhere in the darkness and its vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">little pellet smacked into the bulkhead behind them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frazer grunted as he turned to descend. "Well, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess we'll have to accept the invitation, but I sure wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could return his calling card."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hamilton said nothing; he had glimpsed an overturned</seg><seg type="columnLine">suitcase, and he suddenly realized what the bandits were</seg><seg type="columnLine">after. The ionic separator! Or rather the plans of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were all in a neat bundle in his suitcase in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon. A sickening impotency overwhelmed him. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">if to emphasize it the heavy steel hatch over the engine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room companionway clanged shut. They were prisoners</seg><seg type="columnLine">neatly bottled up in the interior of the Boanerges.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Isn't there any other way out?" he demanded of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nope," laconically replied that grease-smeared indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vidual, as he seated himself in the crook of the port oil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feed manifold and pulled out a pipe, "less you can crawl</seg><seg type="columnLine">out one o' them ports." He waved in the direction of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small heavy glass light set in a deep recess of the engine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room walls. Hamilton hurried over to it, cupped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands to shield his eyes, and peered out. At first he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">make out nothing, but gradually he saw through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">murk the shape of a small motor sled, a dim light burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its cabin. It lay directly under the port-hole like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tug beside an ocean liner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He beckoned to Frazer and showed him his discovery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If we could only smash up that sled--then they'd have</seg><seg type="columnLine">no way to escape!" He turned excitedly to the engineer,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"a heavy piece of iron dropped out of this port-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "--wouldn't work," cut in Frazer, "we couldn't get</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything heavy enough through here to damage that</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've got to think of something!"

He dashed over to the control panel of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hydraulically operated hatch locks.

They waited in darkness for the attack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which came soon. The bandits, enraged at the coup</seg><seg type="columnLine">which cut off their means of retreat, were apparently de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined on revenge. The steel hatch rang to the impact</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an explosion, which was followed immediately by</seg><seg type="columnLine">another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Kruf impact nitro shells---thirty-eight calibre, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should say," muttered Frobisher.

There seemed to be only two voices--</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently the gang consisted of only three men; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one was locked in the storeroom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frazer approached the hatch and shouted up "'Ahoy</seg><seg type="columnLine">above! you might as well give up peaceably.

After a time the two voices broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">into argument. They increased in violence; apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was fatal dissension. The argument culminated</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a deafening series of detonations on the hatch top--</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone must have discharged the whole magazine of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kruf against it. There was a yell of rage, a clatter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal and the sound of heavy running footsteps. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes all was silence, then the footsteps returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and someone rapped sharply on the hatch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right you below!

Beneath me, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fading sunlight of late afternoon, there stretches</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vast mass of the mighty city's structures. New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">ft *s--hut such a New York as never man looked upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. And it is with its familiar but infinitely strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">panorama before my eyes that I start now this record</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great change.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MY name is Allan Harker. Dr. Allan Harker,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	could say, for it has been seven years</seg><seg type="columnLine">since I took the degree and with it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">position on the biological staff of Manhat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tan University. That was a great day for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Manhattan was one of the most renowned of east-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern universities, and its biological department in par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticular was known to scientists the world over. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">due not only to the department's unrivalled equipment,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">429</seg><seg type="columnLine">430</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">but also in greater part to two of the scientists who</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked in it, Dr. Howard Grant, head of the depart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, and Dr. Raymond Ferson, his associate. Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">proud I was to have won so soon the opportunity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">working with those two world-famed biologists. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">even prouder I was when, in the next years, my work</seg><seg type="columnLine">came gradually to link my name with theirs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grant and Ferson and Harker--we were known to</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists across half the world. It was Grant, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eldest of us, who was best known. A tall, saturnine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced and dark-browed Scotsman, his utter and undivided</seg><seg type="columnLine">passion for research was a byword among us. It used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be said, though not in his hearing, that Grant would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">vivisected his own grandmother if he thought some new</seg><seg type="columnLine">principle might be learned by it. All respected the man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the man's achievements, but he never had a tithe of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the popularity that was Ferson's. Ferson was in fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">a complete contrast to his superior, a short-statured man</seg><seg type="columnLine">of middle age with unruly hair and beard and warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown, friendly eyes. As for myself, the third of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trio, I had neither the brilliant scientific mind of Grant</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor the keen vision of Ferson, but by dint of ceaseless</seg><seg type="columnLine">plodding with monotonous details, I had built for myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">a reputation that linked my name with theirs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aside from our professorial duties in the university's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lecture-rooms, we had each of us our separate work. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was plodding away with my dull experiments on cell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grouping, which I expected would some day yield a</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory that would astound all cytologists. Now and then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	received help on some difficult point from Ferson, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was himself immersed in an attempt to demolish the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snelsen-Morrs re-vertebration theory by prying into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior structure of innumerable unheard-of lizards.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grant, however, never received or gave any help, keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his work entirely to himself. We had gathered, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rare references to it, that he had been working for</seg><seg type="columnLine">months on one of the broader problems of evolutionary</seg><seg type="columnLine">science, but that was all we knew, and we were as</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazed as any when Grant published the statement that</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched off the sensational "evolution controversy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is needless for me to give here all the details of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. It is sufficient to say that Grant, in his statement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">announced that he had solved at last the greatest enigma</seg><seg type="columnLine">of biological science--ttiat he had discovered the cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">of evolution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One can understand what an uproar that statement</seg><seg type="columnLine">created, and was bound to create. For the cause of evo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutionary change has always been the supreme problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">of biology. Long ago Darwin and Wallace and Lamarck</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their fellows had laid the processes of evolution bare.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had shown to an astonished world that life on earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not static in forms that had always existed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">always would exist, but that it was in constant change</seg><seg type="columnLine">and movement up through constantly changing forms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The eohippus had changed, had evolved into the horse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in future ages would be something different still.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The great felines that had roamed earth had evolved into</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller forms and into tame cats. A certain branch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ape-like forms had evolved into great hairy troglodytes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then into modern men. All life on earth was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly changing, evolving, forced ever upward through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the diverging channels of evolution into new and differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent forms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what force was it that pressed earth's life thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward through the paths of change? What force was</seg><seg type="columnLine">it that caused all this vast, slow evolution of earth's crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures into different creatures, that had begun with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">first jelly-like life-forms on earth and had forced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tide of life up from them to the forms of today, that still</seg><seg type="columnLine">was slowly changing them? That question none could</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer. Environment did not explain it, for though</seg><seg type="columnLine">environment had certain effects on the life-forms in it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not responsible for that deep, vast tide of upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolution. Mendelism had seemed for a time to suggest</seg><seg type="columnLine">an explanation but had failed in the end to do so. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">great force there was, all knew, that pressed life always</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the path of evolution, but none had ever guessed what</seg><seg type="columnLine">that force might be, and the thing had come to be ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cepted at last as one of the insoluble problems of science.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And now Grant claimed that he had solved it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For long," Grant's statement said, "I have held that</seg><seg type="columnLine">since evolutionary change is unquestionably caused by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some definite and omnipresent force acting upon all life</seg><seg type="columnLine">on earth, it should be possible to discover the nature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that force. I will not recount the work of months which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	have spent in constant search for this force, but will</seg><seg type="columnLine">say that finally I have been successful, have identified the</seg><seg type="columnLine">force which my experiments show beyond all doubt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the single force responsible for the upward course of</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolution on earth. That force is a vibratory force, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibration unknown to earth's physicists prior to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery of it, which has as its source the sun!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The sun, we know, is a vast mass of incandescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter which ceaselessly pours out part of its matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">transformed into energy. The energy thus formed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flooding out in all directions from the sun through</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, takes various forms. At a certain vibratory fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quency, it takes the form of light and illuminates our</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. At another frequency, it is radiant heat, warming</seg><seg type="columnLine">our world. At still another, it is the cosmic ray so re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cently discovered. There are many others, known to us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and still more of which we know nothing as yet, a vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">welter of vibratory forces flooding endlessly outward</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the sun. And it is one of those vibrations, one which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we well may call the evolution vibration, which is re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponsible for the evolutionary change of all life on earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In this there is nothing astounding. The sun's</seg><seg type="columnLine">various vibratory forces affect all living things on earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">profoundly, each in a different manner. Without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light-vibrations earth's life would fade and die, the ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sence of the ultra-violet waves being fatal in time. With-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out its heat-radiations all life would freeze. And without</seg><seg type="columnLine">this evolution vibration playing ceaselessly upon earth, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">life upon earth would no longer be pressed upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the paths of evolution, would slip back swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">down those paths, down the myriad roads up which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">has surged for so long. For not only is it this evolution</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibration that forces earth's life upward on the way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">change, it is this vibration that keeps earth's life from</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipping backward!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus for Grant's statement. To Ferson and me it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as astonishing as to the rest of the scientific world, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">not until then did we learn what work it was that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied Grant for so long. Yet even we two, I think,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were surprised at the sensation that that statement</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused. Always the work of Dr. Grant had been accepted</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost without question, so great was his reputation and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so brilliant his achievements. But with the publication</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this amazing new theory of his, the general dislike of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man that had always lain latent, burst forth into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm of criticism.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was admitted that the new vibratory force which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grant had discovered did apparently exist, since other</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists working on his data had corroborated his</seg><seg type="columnLine">WORLD ATAVISM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">431</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">work on it. But it was denied, by Grant's numerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">critics, that this force was what he claimed it to be--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of evolutionary change. It was impossible, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated, that such a so-called evolution vibration could in</seg><seg type="columnLine">reality be responsible for the course of evolution on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. And it was even more absurd to suggest as Grant</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done that were that force withdrawn, were the evo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lution vibration to cease to play on earth from the sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the living beings of earth would slip swiftly backward</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the road of change.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The controversy over the thing grew, in fact, to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of bitterness unprecedented in scientific discussion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bitterness intensified by the comments of the saturnine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and black-tempered Grant. In a series of sardonic state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, he compared his critics to those who had derided</seg><seg type="columnLine">the work of Darwin and his fellows, and indulged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some rather acrid personalities. These in turn provoked</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiercer attacks, and the whole matter grew thus quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into an unseemly intellectual brawl. To Ferson and</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself the whole controversy seemed a useless one, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause, in the course of time, experimentation by other</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists would definitely prove or disprove Grant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory. Yet neither of us ventured to suggest that to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our bitter superior, and so the wrangle grew in intensity</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the next days until it suddenly came to a head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the elderly President Rogers of Manhattan</seg><seg type="columnLine">University who brought the thing to a focus. He and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the university's other officials had been growing more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more restive under the criticisms that Grant's con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">troversy was bringing on the school, and so at last he</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested that a meeting be held at which Grant could</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay his theories and data before his fellow-scientists in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their entirety. This Grant accepted, and so too did most</seg><seg type="columnLine">biologists of any note within traveling distance of New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York, so widely had the clamor of the dispute spread.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And on an afternoon Grant rose before several hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">assembled scientists in one of the university's lecture-</seg><seg type="columnLine">halls to explain his discovery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is little need for me to tell at length of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">took place at that meeting, which both Ferson and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">attended. At the first appearance of Dr. Grant his ene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mies in the audience grew vocal in their criticisms, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he had spoken a quarter of an hour the hall was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in such an uproar as a scientific meeting has seldom heard;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twice Grant made an effort to go on and each time his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice was drowned by a storm of shouted cries. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">President, chairman of the meeting, was rapping vainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">for order, but Grant only stood still, looking out over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stormy meeting with a cold contempt in his eyes, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a strange fire in them. Quietly he rolled up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">data-sheets in his hand and thrust them into his pocket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as quietly stepped forward to the platform's edge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something in his bearing, in his expression, quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">quieted the noisy throng before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice came out over the hall cold and clear. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">have not let me give to you the proof for which you</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The President stepped to his side, said something</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly, but Grant shook his head calmly. "No proof</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I can give you here would convince you of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory's truth, I know," he told the silent throng before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, "but I will give you proof of it yet! To you, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the world, I will give a proof such as the world has</seg><seg type="columnLine">never seen before!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before any could move, he had walked from the plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form and out of the hall. A buzz of excited voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke out instantly, in comment and criticism, it was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">some hours later before Ferson and I got from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting to Grant's laboratory. But Grant was not there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within twenty-four hours more we knew, and all at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the university knew, that Dr. Grant had disappeared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the meeting he went to his laboratory, burned some</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers there and pocketed others. Then he went to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms, hastily packed a few bags and departed. He left</seg><seg type="columnLine">no note, no message. His action brought to a climax the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole sensation of the controversy he had precipitated</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Grant's going was taken by many of his critics as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">confession of the falsity of his position. He had had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">close relatives to start a search for him, and though to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ferson and me his strange departure seemed astounding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could explain it no better than others. The sensation</seg><seg type="columnLine">subsided, and Ferson was appointed to head the depart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment in place of the vanished scientist. Our own work</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied us once more. And certainly neither Ferson</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor I, any more than another, guessed what lay behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grant's strange action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was six months after Grant's departure that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great change began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first intimation was brought to the public notice</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a New York newspaper. In a sensational article</seg><seg type="columnLine">entitled "Is a New Crime Wave Upon Us?" it pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out that in the last few days an unprecedented number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of crimes of violence had taken place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These were the more appalling in that many seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite without motive. In New York alone, in those few</seg><seg type="columnLine">days, there had been more than a dozen murders, mostly</seg><seg type="columnLine">clubbings and stabbings, which had apparently been pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voked by the slightest of causes. In Chicago a respected</seg><seg type="columnLine">clerk of middle age had for some annoyance turned sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly and fractured the skulls of three of his associates</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a heavy bar. From San Francisco and Los Angeles</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come news of half a dozen holocausts in which one</seg><seg type="columnLine">member of a family had slaughtered or attempted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaughter all the others. From every part of the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were coming reports of the most horrifying crimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of violence, the great majority of which seemed inspired</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the pettiest of causes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And this same wave of homicidal mania seemed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">work over all the world! It was as though hundreds in</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's population had suddenly had their reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwarfed and their passions magnified. No less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">three solid householders in London had run amuck in</seg><seg type="columnLine">bursts of sadistic* fury that had cost a half-score lives.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Paris police had taken from the Seine more human</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies, many terribly mutilated, than had ever been found</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it in a like time before. Germany was aghast over</seg><seg type="columnLine">two mass-murders of unexampled fiendishness that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred in a Rhenish and a Silesian village. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">news of an even more terrible slaying in Calcutta, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">word of murders almost as terrible from almost every</seg><seg type="columnLine">country on the globe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nor was it murder alone that was stalking the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for robberies of the utmost brutality were even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerous. Overshadowed as they were by the greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror, they were as astonishing in nature. For all, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slayings, seemed the result of sudden brutal instincts</seg><seg type="columnLine">or desires uncontrolled by reason. Small shopkeepers in</seg><seg type="columnLine">American and English towns were struck down for</seg><seg type="columnLine">trifles. In the stores of great cities there were those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched childishly at desired objects and attempted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopeless escape to the street. That was the keynote of all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">*Sadism, of which this word is the adjective, is a mental perversion</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">towards cruelty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">432</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">these robberies, of all these crimes--the unreasoning</seg><seg type="columnLine">childishness of them. For the great part of them were</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempted under circumstances which should have shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">to even the most dull-witted that there was no chance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a wave of strange and terrible crime, indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was sweeping over all the earth. The newspapers</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned themselves with it to the exclusion of all else</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon. They sought for explanations. What had caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">this sudden release of the most brutal passions of num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">berless people? Many were the answers. An eminent</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist declared that the nerve-racking strain of modern</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilization had reached such a pitch that the human</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind could no longer stand it, was giving way beneath it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many wrote serious letters to the press denouncing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion pictures as schools of crime. Others defended</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. And while the cause was thus argued, the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave of crime and utter lawlessness that had rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">across earth seemed increasing in volume.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The number of deaths by violence that were each day</seg><seg type="columnLine">recorded had grown now to an appalling figure. Mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derous attacks were common in every one of earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">great cities. Men hurled themselves at each other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">throats, apparently for a word, a gesture. Nor was this</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. A strange erratic insanity seemed seizing more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of earth's millions. Numberless were those re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported to the authorities as missing, those who had wan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered causelessly away from home and family. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">world's roads held an unprecedented number of vagrant</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanderers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But in a few days more even this astounding wave of</seg><seg type="columnLine">appalling crime was dwarfed in importance by more as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tounding and more terrible happenings. Accidents, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great number of them fatal to many, were occurring in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every part of earth in an amount that was all but</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> More than a hundred people had gone to death in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash of two thundering passenger trains in Colorado,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crash that had been due to the failure of an engineer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">heed the plainest of signals. Two train wrecks in north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern England had taken a toll of life almost as great, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were reports of many other crashes from various</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts of earth. In every one the accident had been due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the inexplicable failure of the human element, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">failure of dispatcher or switchman or engineer to per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form the duty that habit should have made automatic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In one case, that of the Austrian disaster, the crash had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been directly caused by the sudden craziness of a switch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, who, for some slight grievance, had sent a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">passenger-train crashing through an open switch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down an embankment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was news as terrible from the seas. Wireless</seg><seg type="columnLine">reports flashed thick with word of ships that had blun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered fatally on rocks or shoals by fault of helmsman or</seg><seg type="columnLine">navigating officer. The greater part of these, fortu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nately, were freight-ships of medium and small size, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">one case sent a thrill of horror through earth, already-</seg><seg type="columnLine">steeped in horror. That was when the great transatlantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">liner Garonia, bound to Southampton, crashed by night</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the southern Irish coast with the resulting loss of</seg><seg type="columnLine">three-fourths of the thousand humans it carried. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">that wreck, like the others, was due to an utterly inex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicable failure of the ship's personnel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smaller in magnitude, but taking a total of far more</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives, were the unnumbered accidents that took place in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thickly populated and highly mechanized countries of</seg><seg type="columnLine">North America and Europe. The number of automobile</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">deaths, always staggering America, reached a stunning</seg><seg type="columnLine">total in those last fateful days of September. Crashes</seg><seg type="columnLine">took place at every corner, and the running down of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedestrians became a common occurrence everywhere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many cars mowed a path of death through street and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidewalk before they were halted, their drivers losing</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently all faculty of control of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And in mill and shop and factory death's grim hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">was reaping as thickly. Men, upon whom the lives of</seg><seg type="columnLine">many depended, suddenly lost control of their machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sent those many to death. Countless others were</seg><seg type="columnLine">mangled or crushed to death by the great mechanisms</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had operated for years without mishaps. Airplane</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashes became so numerous that many sections of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world peremptorily forbade all further flying until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of it all could be ascertained. It was as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">more and more of the masses of men were becoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">incapable of handling the mechanisms, of conducting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operations, that they had been executing for years. Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mankind going collectively insane?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed insanity, indeed, that was sweeping earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. Riots had taken place on a small scale here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in those days, but it was not until after the first of</seg><seg type="columnLine">October that the first of the great outbreaks took place</seg><seg type="columnLine">in London. Crowds of wandering men and women</seg><seg type="columnLine">began the looting of shops, the breaking of win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows, and the rioting swiftly spread. So swiftly did it</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread, in fact, that by the time the troops called to</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppress it appeared on the scene, unestimated thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">were engaged in the wild search for plunder. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to fire, an irregular volley from the troops killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">scores, but in the pitched mob battle that followed scores</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the soldiers took the side of the looters. The combat</seg><seg type="columnLine">between mob and soldiers was forgotten, and the battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">became a wild scene of brutality and violence in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds were slain and trampled. In the end it re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired machine-guns to disperse them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A similar great outbreak in New York was curbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly a day later by the use of planes and tear-bomb's,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but two days after there came a huge riot of unexampled</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloodiness in Chicago, which cost several thousand lives</seg><seg type="columnLine">and which resulted in the burning of a third of the city. '</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beginning as a race riot and developing into a savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">general battle for loot, it was notable for the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the troops, called to suppress it, broke up even before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they reached the scene and occupied themselves in brutal</seg><seg type="columnLine">looting and battle of their own. And a score of great</seg><seg type="columnLine">riots in the other cities of earth had similar results.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Civilization seemed crashing, with this oncoming dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solution of its organization and institutions. Had hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manity gone insane, indeed ? Swiftly, with full realiza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the peril upon it by then, a conference of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world's most noted scientists had been called some days</seg><seg type="columnLine">before at New York, to explain and to halt, if possible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this wave of seeming insanity that was gripping more of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the masses of humanity each day and that was disinte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grating civilization.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when those scientists met, the world learned that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had a hundred different explanations of the thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no two agreeing. The famous American alienist who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had voiced his opinion days before reiterated his belief</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the minds of men were giving way en masse beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strain of modern civilization. A Rumanian bacte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riologist claimed that the thing was the result of a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tagious new brain disease spreading over earth, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed even to have isolated the bacterium of that dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease. ,The scientists, gripped seemingly by something of</seg><seg type="columnLine">WORLD ATAVISM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">433</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the erratic condition of mind they were striving to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain, argued these theories and others with utmost pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion, sometimes attacking each other. An English</seg><seg type="columnLine">physicist, who suggested that earth was passing through</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange mind-affecting gases in space, was assaulted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proponent of another theory. And still more furious</seg><seg type="columnLine">and incredulous, the world learned, was the reception</seg><seg type="columnLine">given to the explanation of a New York biologist named</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ferson, who claimed that the whole great terror was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">result of the human races slipping backward on the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">of evolution!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "World atavism! A throwback of all the world's life</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the road of evolution!" So, they learned, Ferson had</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried to the assembled scientists. "All earth's animal life</seg><seg type="columnLine">is beginning to slip back, and man, as the most recently</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed animal, is slipping first, is going back toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the savage state, toward the cave-man or troglodyte,</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the ape! He is losing control of his passions as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he goes back, which accounts for the violence that now</seg><seg type="columnLine">fills earth! And he is losing the mental capacity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">modern man, which accounts for his inability to operate</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer our modern machines! A world atavism that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning with the atavism of the human races!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what could cause such world atavism as that?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the incredulous scientists had cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The evolutionary theory of my former associate, Dr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Grant-" Ferson had begun, but was interrupted by a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">chorus of derisive shouts provoked by the mention of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist whose ridiculous theory had been exploded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Ferson had been forced from the meeting by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">furious scientists, who seemed seized indeed with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">erratic craziness that was gripping the world. Another</seg><seg type="columnLine">day they advanced and argued their theories, theories</seg><seg type="columnLine">that grew ever more impossible, more incoherent, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the meeting dissolved in a general riotous brawl of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arguing scientists. They, in common with the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the races of men, seemed incapable longer of calm</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, of cool, impassioned reasoning. Two were</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed, throttled in the brawl that ended the meeting, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest scattered. They were not followed or punished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for now the disintegration of humanity's institutions had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become such that crime was unheeded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men were outrivalling each other in mad action. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">in high places as in low were gripped by the insanity that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had apparently seized earth, and from the Cabinets and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Congresses of a score of nations came declarations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">war against other nations, for the slightest of reasons or</seg><seg type="columnLine">for none at all. England, the' United States, France,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Germany, Italy, Turkey, Japan and China--these and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen others issued frenzied and incoherent calls to</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms. But they were unheeded! Even war now could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not penetrate the unreasoning minds of men. Armies</seg><seg type="columnLine">had broken up, all discipline and organization vanishing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A few who tried to keep their soldiers in line found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men could no longer handle the great guns and instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of war, found that most of them were incapable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the operation of rifles!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Civilization was crashing with a prolonged roar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling laws and institutions and customs echoing across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world. The ordinary methods of transportation and</seg><seg type="columnLine">production having completely broken down days before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stream of food into the great cities had abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased. The brutal throngs that filled those cities sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted by looting the existing food supplies for a time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but soon these were exhausted and then terrible battles</seg><seg type="columnLine">took place between the rioters for food which they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found. Battles they were of hordes of ragged brutes, of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> savages, who fought with knives or with their bare hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the streets. Only occasionally was a shot heard, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost none there was now with sufficient dull glimmer</seg><seg type="columnLine">of intelligence to manipulate a gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the shadow of the tall towers of New York, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brick and stone acres of London . and the boulevards</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Paris, thousands and hundreds of thousands of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages swarmed, the ways choked with corpses of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slain. At night they crouched fearfully in hallways and</seg><seg type="columnLine">offices and corridors, the vast cities lying dark and silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the stars. Shapes of prowling animals were</seg><seg type="columnLine">being seen in some of them by night. No wheel turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all the world now, for none seemed left with intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gence enough to operate the simplest machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And these swarms that had been human were changing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in appearance too. The men were unshaven and hairier,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed. Much clothing had been discarded, crude belts</seg><seg type="columnLine">that held knives or the like weapons being retained. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched now as they walked, their step a watchful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal-like one. From under shaggy brows they stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at each other. Small, crude family-groups held together,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man battling other men for the possession of food.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some managed to kill animals, and wore the skins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were troglodytes, millions of them, men such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world had seen thousands of years before, as hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manity had been then. They were troglodytes, wandering</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the cities and towns that they themselves had</seg><seg type="columnLine">built, staring in wondering fear about them at things</seg><seg type="columnLine">the purpose of which they could not understand. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">most had no wonder, only a brutal lack of interest in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">save food and mating and sleep. There were no fires, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">all had lost the use of fire and feared it now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Driven by hunger, great masses of them were pouring</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the cities into the countryside, to hunt roots and</seg><seg type="columnLine">herbs and to kill small animals for food. They made</seg><seg type="columnLine">rude shelters for a time, then abandoned them for caves</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crannies in the rocks. They ceased to use knives or</seg><seg type="columnLine">spears, they could but throw great stones at each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">or wield chance clubs, or fight with bare hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many had remained in the cities and among them was</seg><seg type="columnLine">more fighting. With each day they were changing far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther, it seemed, going farther back along the long road</seg><seg type="columnLine">of change that man had ascended so slowly through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages, and that he was slipping back upon so swiftly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The streets of New York and Glasgow and Constan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinople and Yokohama saw them, these animal-like, ape-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like hordes that wandered there. Ape-like they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">becoming, indeed, swiftly hairier of body, more crouch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of gait, stooping occasionally in moving to rim on</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and feet. Clothing they had discarded. The frag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentary, mumbled speech that they had kept until days</seg><seg type="columnLine">before had given way to a meaningless medley of barking</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouts and cries whose tone conveyed their crude at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt at communication. They roamed the great cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">in little groups or tribes, of each of which one was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strongest, the tyrant, the acknowledged lord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now, they were changing still. Were running</seg><seg type="columnLine">more on hands and feet, walking upright less. Back</seg><seg type="columnLine">from man to troglodyte, and from troglodyte to ape had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the human races gone, and now were slipping back still</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the animal races from which the apes had come!</seg><seg type="columnLine">World atavism--and it was wiping the last human-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms from the face of earth!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF this great change that in days swept man back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brutal forms of dead ages, I, Allan Harker, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a witness from the first. For it was at New York that</seg><seg type="columnLine">434</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the early manifestations of the change had been first</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed, in that increasing wave of terrible crime that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in days to rage over the whole earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neither Ferson nor I, of course, had any suspicion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing's real magnitude in those first days. We fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed, with the same astonishment that held most in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, the astounding growth of crime and violence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was remote from our own interests, and we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">both very much absorbed in our differing work of experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentation. We spent more time on that work, indeed, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">those days than before, for both Ferson and I seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have lost a little of our usual skill and knowledge. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that he caught himself in inexplicable lapses, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	know that I, usually the most patient of biologists, for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">got myself in sudden impatient rage on one or two occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions and smashed retorts and test-tubes about me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neither of us dreamed, of course, that we were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">affected by the same strange forces that were releasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">humanity's passions in a carnival of crime.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when a little later the great wave of crime that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was making earth hideous was made more terrible by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the innumerable inexplicable accidents that were occur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring, Ferson became thoughtful. He deserted his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">white-tiled laboratories for the university's psychological</seg><seg type="columnLine">test-rooms with their strange recording instruments, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent hours there carrying out intricate tests of the reac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of himself and others. It was after two days of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such tests, when the fatal accidents occurring everywhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">were taking toll of thousands of lives daily, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost all industrial activity was slowing and stopping</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of them, that Ferson came back, his countenance</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I had never seen it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've found it, Allan," he said quietly. "The cause of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all this terror--these innumerable crimes and accidents</seg><seg type="columnLine">and riotings."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The cause of them ?" I repeated, uncomprehendingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, and that cause is world atavism! An atavism, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">throwback, of all the world's animal life, that is begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning with man as the most recently developed animal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is taking place before our eyes! Taking place in</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves even!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "World atavism!" I gasped. "But, Ferson--that such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thing could be---it's inconceivable!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shook his head. "Not inconceivable. You remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber Grant and his theory, that the evolution vibrations</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the sun were what had pushed earth's life up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road of evolution? And you remember that Grant</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that were those evolution vibrations to cease to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach earth from the sun, all earth's life would slip</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly back upon that road ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I remember," I said, "but how could such a thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen? What could ever halt the play of the sun's</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolution vibrations on earth?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ferson's eyes were somber. "I do not know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">could," he said slowly, "but I think I know who could!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ferson!" I cried. "You don't for an instant think</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that Grant-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do think so," he said, his voice steelly. "Grant dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered the existence of the evolution vibrations--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone of men knew all concerning them. Do you remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber what he said when they ref used to let him explain his</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory even at that meeting ? He said: *1 will give you</seg><seg type="columnLine">proof of this. I will give you proof yet of this theory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and such a proof as the world has never seen before!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">My mind was reeling. "Then you think that when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grant disappeared--that he-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think that that great proof that Grant promised in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rage to give the world is the world atavism that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon humanity now! I think that Grant in some incon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceivable way has used his knowledge and his power to</seg><seg type="columnLine">deflect or dampen the evolution vibrations coming toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth from the sun, and that it is because of the absence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those vibrations that earth's life is slipping backward!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But where will it stop ?" I exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will not stop, Harker--this tremendous change has</seg><seg type="columnLine">only begun. Man, the most recently evolved of all ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals, is changing first, and will go back through troglo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dyte and ape to the forms before them, back through</seg><seg type="columnLine">changing beast-forms. By then the other animals of</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth will be changing also, thrown back along the evolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionary road, and that great atavism will continue until</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's life has all changed back into the first crude pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toplasmic forms from which eons ago it sprung!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what can we do?" I cried. "There must be some</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of stopping this!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is only one way," he said. "Grant is causing</seg><seg type="columnLine">this great world atavism, is shutting off the sun's evolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion vibrations from earth by projecting toward the sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt, a great dampening or neutralizing vibration</seg><seg type="columnLine">that stifles them, annihilates them, at their source. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">must find Grant's whereabouts, must destroy whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus he is using to do that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yet if all are changing--we two also must be chang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing !" I exclaimed, and he nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We two are already a little affected as all men are,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more or less. Our lapses of memory, the difficulties we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have in our work now, these things in the last days are</seg><seg type="columnLine">the result of this world atavism in us, just as the crimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and accidents filling earth are. And we two must pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tect ourselves against this tremendous change, whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">we do, for on us depends the one chance of halting</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grant's terrible work. The world will never believe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">that dread work is really going on until it is too late, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and I must not change!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ferson went swiftly on to explain his idea. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">none other than to construct two small projectors that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would each automatically and ceaselessly generate arti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficial evolution vibrations, vibrations affecting a limited</seg><seg type="columnLine">range as the sun's vibrations had affected all earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These projectors in their compact cases could be worn</seg><seg type="columnLine">on our bodies by each of us without being noticeable, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would keep each of us always thus in the range of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vital vibrations, so that we would not be affected by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world-wide absence of that which was causing this world</seg><seg type="columnLine">atavism. Whatever great dampening wave Grant was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sending out toward the sun to neutralize its evolution</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrations would not, of course, affect the vibrations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own little projectors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next two days saw us at work upon these pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jectors. The method of producing the evolution vibra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions we knew, for as I have mentioned, they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">artificially produced in a small way by physicists upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grant's first announcement of his theory. The second</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, therefore, saw our projectors complete, small flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">black cases that were strapped to our belts without being</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticeable, each holding the tiny but marvelously power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful batteries that were the current-source, and the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pact little generator that automatically and unendingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">released the vital evolution vibrations for a range of</seg><seg type="columnLine">several feet. With these completed and working, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">secured thus by them from being ourselves affected by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrible atavism that was upon the races of man, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">began our greater work of locating Grant and the appa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">WORLD ATAVISM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">435</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ratus by which he was shutting off the sun's vibrations</seg><seg type="columnLine">and loosing this horror on the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For horror it had now become, and the world was</seg><seg type="columnLine">waking up to its true nature as every sort of brutal pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion was released in terrible crime over it, and as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inexplicable mindlessness of men brought on terrific acci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dents. Already a dozen of the greatest governments in</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooperation had called a conference of earth's greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists at New York to explain or to halt at least the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror that was sweeping earth. To that conference</seg><seg type="columnLine">they came with each a different and more incredible ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planation of the thing, and to it went Ferson and I to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give them the true explanation and to turn them toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the search for Grant that might yet save humanity. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">that explanation was never given, for Ferson's first men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of world atavism was greeted with incredulous cries,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when he went on to mention Grant, such a derisive</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm arose, that he was forced bodily from the meeting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving the scientists disputing fiercely over the most im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible of theories, supporting and opposing those theo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ries by blows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For they, like-the rest of humanity, seemed incapable</seg><seg type="columnLine">now of clear and sustained thought upon any subject.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even Ferson and I, working day and night in the isolated</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper Manhattan laboratories of the university, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to see clearly what was happening about us. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were living, eating, sleeping at the laboratories by this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, for all means of transportation and all industrial</seg><seg type="columnLine">activities were ceasing. Great masses of men roamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the streets of the city, some forming into gangs that</seg><seg type="columnLine">made life terrible for the others, the rest engaged in in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">discriminate looting. The great London riot and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">abortive outbreak in lower New York had now taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, and it was evident to all that the last shadow of</seg><seg type="columnLine">law and order in the city was vanishing, for more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more the troops and police who maintained it were en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaging in the rioting themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> News came still a little, in incoherently written and er-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ratically printed sheets, for a few days, and it was thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">we learned of the huge Chicago riot and subsequent fire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It marked the beginning of the end. Within a few days</seg><seg type="columnLine">more utter lawlessness reigned over New York, corpses</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay in its streets and looters were everywhere. The uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versity buildings, deserted now by all but ourselves, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not attacked except on a few occasions by the looting</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarms, there being no food or other desirable things in</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and Ferson and I had rifles and pistols in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory to repel the ragged and brutal gangs that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might attack us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In those terrible days we were occupied heart and soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the work of locating Grant and whatever mechanism</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was by which he was casting this doom on humanity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was Ferson's idea that the great damping wave, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grant must be sending toward the sun to halt the play</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its endless evolution vibrations, would affect certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">recording instruments, if the correct frequency for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">circuits could be fe^nd. Once that was found, by observ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the amount by which the instruments were affected</seg><seg type="columnLine">at different locations by the waves of the great damping</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibration, we could calculate and chart that great wave's</seg><seg type="columnLine">source with some degree of accuracy. It seemed to me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very slender chance, yet I knew as well as did Ferson</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was the one possible way. Grant, we knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have protected himself, as we had, by a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">artificial projector of the vibrations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So in those fearful days we worked with the recording</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments, watching them at each new trial for some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">indication of the force whose source we sought. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole great mass of New York's giant structures that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched southward and downward from our laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay now in complete darkness each night; the last wonted</seg><seg type="columnLine">activities of civilization having ceased in it as elsewhere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ragged hordes of savages roamed it, savages so hairy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouching and brutal of face, seeming each day more</seg><seg type="columnLine">prognathous of jaw and slanting of brow and animal-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">of eye, that we knew them to be troglodytes, cave-men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">men such as humanity had been ages before and such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was over all earth now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We saw them occasionally prowling through the uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versity grounds in search of food, shambling toward us</seg><seg type="columnLine">with lowering brows to attack us when they glimpsed us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but fleeing in fear when we fired over their heads. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of them could manipulate so complicated a thing as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a firearm. All earth's hundreds of millions were prowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their way in just such brutal bands, thrown back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the state that had been man's before history's dawn. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever more brutal and hairy and animal-like they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">becoming as they slipped back farther still, back from</seg><seg type="columnLine">troglodyte to ape! Mankind was gone, transformed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">these still-changing brutes--all except Ferson and me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I CAN NOT tell now in full of those terrible last days</seg><seg type="columnLine">of change, those days in which in our chance glimpses</seg><seg type="columnLine">we saw men making that other terrible step backward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from troglodyte to ape. For Ferson and I were working</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the speed of utter despair. Even were Grant's ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible work to be halted, the sun's evolution vibrations</seg><seg type="columnLine">again released on earth, it would take them untold ages</seg><seg type="columnLine">to raise the brute-like beings about us to the status of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men once more. Humanity was passing, had passed, into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brute around us, yet for their sake, for the sake of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the humanity that might rise again in the dim future, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept to our efforts, sought still to halt this awful change,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would otherwise not stop until protoplasmic slime</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone was left living on earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had found the correct frequency for the circuits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our recording instruments, and in feverish haste set up</seg><seg type="columnLine">those instruments at intervals of a mile, working through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night. The weirdest of work it was, the vast city's</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets and structures silent in the night around us, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless hordes of brute-like beings that once had built</seg><seg type="columnLine">them now cowering in the buildings in ape-like fear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night's mysteries. We took our readings, hastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to our laboratory, and dawn found us marking those</seg><seg type="columnLine">readings on the great chart-map of the section we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready. Somewhere in that section, somewhere near New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York, we knew, Grant lurked with his terrible mecha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nism, our first readings having shown us that. And now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as with trembling hands Ferson and I drew the graphs</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the big chart, we stared for a moment after in com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those lines converged at a point in a midtown block</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great city south of us, a block occupied by a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic building whose aspiring tower was in sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our laboratory's windows!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For moments Ferson and I stared from chart to tower</seg><seg type="columnLine">in silence, and then without words we had turned, seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the filled magazines of the pistols at our belts, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were passing out of the laboratory into the bright sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. As silent as ever, we started southward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Never, were my existence extended a thousand years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could there be blotted from my memory that journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">southward through the silent towers of New York that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ferson and I made then. For the great city that lay:</seg><seg type="columnLine">436</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">silent about us beneath the brilliant noon sunshine, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a city of horror unutterable. Dead lay thick in its streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and great dogs, already strange and fierce and wolflike,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran in packs among them. The rusting wrecks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed automobiles were piled at every corner. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">window of all we passed remained intact, sidewalks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets were sprinkled with shivered glass. Westward</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the river a great fire was burning in the cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, pouring a black volume of flame-laced smoke up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the skies. But more terrible than all of these things</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the hordes, the swarms of creatures that moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the streets and ways about us, the countless</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures that once had been the city's people!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Great ape-like creatures they were, not apes such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">men had known, but ape-like races such as men had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprung from eons before. In groups and packs of scores</seg><seg type="columnLine">they roamed the city's ways. Covered with thick hair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stooped and crouching of gait, the garments that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had worn as men torn and discarded, there was in them</seg><seg type="columnLine">no semblance to humanity. They walked stiffly toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other, stooping to rest hairy forearms on the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">each few steps. They growled and barked in rage, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">chattered volubly and meaninglessly. The majority were</seg><seg type="columnLine">prowling in wrecked stores for fragments of food.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Others moved along the streets in a search for small</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals, for insects even.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Growling in rage their groups came toward Ferson and</seg><seg type="columnLine">me as we moved onward, but each time a pistol-shot sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">them fleeing from us. We moved on, never speaking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ferson's face icy calm, my own brain reeling. We came</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last to the base of the giant building that we knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">must hold whatever mechanism Grant was using to with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold the evolution vibrations from the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ferson turned to speak to me for the first time. "Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where in here," he whispered. "We must search, Harker</seg><seg type="columnLine">-to find Grant's apparatus-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And if he is with it?" I asked, but his only answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to tighten his grip on the pistol in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We passed into the great building's marble entrance</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall, a place of dim shadows, through which we stum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled over prostrate dead. We went quickly through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">looted, wrecked rooms that had been the luxurious shops</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its first level. Then the stairs, and we were going</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward, level after level, searching through the immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">building's numberless offices and rooms. In one or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dead, and some had been wrecked, but in none,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in no part of the building, it seemed, were any of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ape-like throngs. That seemed encouraging, somehow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with beating hearts we pressed on upward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Level after level. We were high in the immense build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; its floors here w*re smaller of extent because of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">pyramidal form. Yet there was no sound from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows about us, no sign of what we sought. Despair</seg><seg type="columnLine">was growing in us, for we were high in the great tower</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was the building's uppermost part, and had found</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. Through the shadowy halls we pressed still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and through the silent rooms lit with the gold of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">westward-swinging sun. But as we moved up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow stair toward the last and highest level of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great tower, something flamed in Ferson's eyes as in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sound had come from above to our ears, a steady,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow clicking as of a great clock. Pistols in hand, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved up, found ourselves in a small hall at the tower's</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. The unused elevator-shaft was beside us, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs that led to the roof. But before us was the single</seg><seg type="columnLine">door that gave access, apparently, to the whole space of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the tower's uppermost level. And from behind it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slow clicking to our ears!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As one we crossed the hall toward that door. Ferson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand on its knob turned slowly, and slowly, astound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly, the door swung open. Our pistols lowered for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment in our amazement, we stepped through,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped. A dozen feet before us stood Grant, a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic in his hand trained upon us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Silence. In it Grant's eyes held ours. His dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">browed powerful face was lit with unholy triumph, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">sardonic exultation. I saw that before us was the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">space of the tower's highest level, thrown into one great</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Huge black-cased and powerful batteries were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged upon each other in scores at one side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Armored cables led from them through incal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culable generators and transformers to a great object at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big room's center. It was like a giant searchlight, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen feet or more in diameter, swung in a frame resem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling gimbals, so that it could be turned in any direction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The twelve-foot disk inside it glowed silently with white</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, and the great thing was turned to face exactly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinking sun westward. It was slowly following the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scending sun, turning slowly under the action of a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">clock-mechanism, whose clicking was loud in our ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grant, Ferson and I-we were silent there in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">room, all motionless, until Grant spoke. His voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">metallic, controlled, mocking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ferson and Harker," he was saying. "Ferson and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harker, who believed in my theory, my power, it seems,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when none else on earth did. Who made projectors like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one that I wear, and have escaped the world doom</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I have released. Have escaped and have come in</seg><seg type="columnLine">search of me, with pistols in their hands, even!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My brain was racing. I knew that to lift the arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our grasp meant instant death. Grant's sardonic mirth</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashed suddenly out in scorn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To come through the city toward this building firing</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots!" he mocked. "Shots that made those brute-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarms beneath us flee, but that warned me at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time of your coming! To steal clumsily in upon me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that way, thinking to surprise me and halt the work that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet finished !'*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That work has gone on too long, Grant," said Ferson</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, his voice strange. "It cannot go on longer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cannot?" came the bitter voice. "You mistake, Fer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son--it must and shall. What are they now but brutes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals; the world of men that derided and refused my</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, that might have transformed them into gods?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brutes, and even more brutal shall they become, going</seg><seg type="columnLine">down through form after form to the first protoplasm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">They asked for proof-1 have given the world proof,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have thrown back humanity eons on the road of progress!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I will throw them and all earth's life back farther</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">still! This great projector-it is worth the months it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">took to build it--months that I toiled here and posed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scientist studying electrical phenomena, working to</seg><seg type="columnLine">finish the projector at last and turn its great damping</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibration toward the sun in a mighty ray! A vibration</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuned to neutralize and destroy that part of the sun's</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolution vibrations radiating toward earth! You have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lost, Ferson-Harker, for you both die this moment</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and this projector shall continue to withhold the evolution</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrations from earth until its life has been thrown back</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this world atavism into the primal protoplasm! Until</seg><seg type="columnLine">I alone am left living upon-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Has pistol roared, for it was at that instant that Ferson</seg><seg type="columnLine">WORLD ATAVISM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">437</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped. But even the bullet could not halt Ferson's rush,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so swift and unexpected was it, and he struck Grant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked him back, I leaped toward the projector.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grant's pistol was detonating even as he was knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, though, and half-way to the machine something</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to strike me two swift, smashing blows beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shoulder. I swayed, staggered on to the projector,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beneath it and reaching toward the cables leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">into it. Grant was springing toward me, his pistol at</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head. But behind him Ferson, blood on his lips and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his breast, half-raised himself, the pistol in his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking. At its crack Grant swayed, collapsed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell, the black compact case at his belt, that had pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served him, breaking loose as he struck the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ferson, leaning, had his dimming eyes upon me, striv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to speak. I reached, grasped the cables, tore at</seg><seg type="columnLine">them once, twice, and then they had ripped loose. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">white light of the disk inside the'great projector vanished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the mechanism that moved it ceased its clicking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The world atavism, that had thrown the races of man</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the state that had been theirs eons before, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended at last! Ferson, his eyes on mine, seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile feebly in approval.

During this period</seg><seg type="columnLine">but two of the captives had left the island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of them was Feodor Balinsky, the greatest living</seg><seg type="columnLine">serumologist and physiological chemist and at one time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arch-enemy of mankind. Balinsky had been captured</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the rest of the Russian leaders and had narrowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped execution for his share in the gigantic crimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Russia had perpetrated. Before his trial, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was examined at the request of Ilga Vestoff by Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Von Helmer, the great Swiss surgeon. Von Helmer has</seg><seg type="columnLine">unhesitatingly pronounced Balinsky as suffering from</seg><seg type="columnLine">dementia caused by a blood clot in his brain and curable</seg><seg type="columnLine">by operative measures. He operated successfully and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Feodor Balinsky, overtaken by remorse, had meditated</seg><seg type="columnLine">suicide. The influence of Ilga Vestoff had prevented</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from doing so and had turned his mighty genius</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into the paths it had trodden before his mind be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came affected and from his island prison had come a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen serums of almost inestimable value to the medical</seg><seg type="columnLine">profession in their age-old fight against disease. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that Ilga Vestoff, who stood in the eyes of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">world for all that was noble and courageous, had married</seg><seg type="columnLine">Balinsky and shared his exile, had turned the tide in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">favor and the results of his work had done the balance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After seven years of imprisonment, he was released</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had since risen to high honors as a result of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">labors of himself and his assistants in the huge research</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory established for him at Pole Mountain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wyoming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other to leave was Nashky himself. Ivan Nashky-</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been the victim of no disease and the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nashky generators were used to guard St. Helena was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no evidence of active co-operation on his part. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man proved to have a colossal brain and not even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">genius of General Hamilton was able to unravel from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mazes of data dragged from it under the influence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypnotic anesthesia, the secrets underlying his invention.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Faced with the alternative of execution for his crimes or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">building enough of his generators to render St. Helena</seg><seg type="columnLine">impregnable against attack, Nashky had capitulated and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had built them and had taught American engineers the</seg><seg type="columnLine">methods of their operation, but no one save himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood their construction. They had proven won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derfully efficient and had needed no repairs since their</seg><seg type="columnLine">erection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nashky had not used all of the tools and materials</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnished him in fabricating the twelve generators, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world soon learned. Scarcely had they been in opera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion for a month before, one evening, a guard saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small rectangular block of dark substance rising from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground in the vicinity of the shops where Nashky</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done his work. The guard had given an alarm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the batteries installed on the island had poured a rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of radite shells toward the strange aircraft, but without</seg><seg type="columnLine">result. An immediate check of the prisoners was made</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was found that Ivan Nashky had made good his</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape. The aerial patrols of the entire world had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once notified on the general broadcast wavelength,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">439</seg><seg type="columnLine">440</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">but from the moment that his ship had disappeared in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly darkening sky, no trace of either him or his</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft had ever been obtained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had done good work on his generators before his</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape and it was soon found that he had constructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the minimum number that would serve to fully safe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard the island of exile. General Hamilton, Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">Signal Officer of the United States, had spent many</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours in measuring the output of the machines and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally rendered an opinion that, were one of them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be put out of operation and disassembled for study,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island would be imperfectly guarded. Despite his</seg><seg type="columnLine">report, an attempt was made to cut one of them out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the circuit but it was found that Nashky had done</seg><seg type="columnLine">his work so cleverly that any attempt to disconnect one</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine made it impossible to start the balance. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">world was therefore forced to forego the mechanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage which the knowledge of their construction</seg><seg type="columnLine">would entail and allow them to remain where their in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventor had set them up, running continuously day and</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, except for the one hour a month when they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut down in order to allow supplies to be landed for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">use of the prisoners and of the garrison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly the two transport aerostats dropped to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground and a detail came from the warehouses to unload</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Hardly had the crews debarked from the ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the dull boom of an alarm gun sounded on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the still air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Commandant in his office located in the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookout tower pressed the button of his communicator</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spoke sharply into it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "A strange aircraft right above us, sir, at about sixty</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand and descending rapidly," reported the sentry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damn it, man, warn them off!" shouted the Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mandant.

He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an old grizzled man with the single stars of a Brigadier</seg><seg type="columnLine">General on his shoulders and the front of his blouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazed with bits of colored ribbon, prominent among</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was the sombre black edged with crimson which</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked him as a veteran of the terrible war with Russia</seg><seg type="columnLine">a decade before. He raised the glasses to his eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared and his face paled momentarily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Judas Priest!" he murmured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment he was frozen into immobility but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifetime of training to meet emergencies came to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rescue and he dashed to his communicator, knocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a chair which stood in the way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Man all batteries!" he shouted. "Align the guns on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that approaching craft as soon as it is within range but</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't fire until I give the word. Start the generators</seg><seg type="columnLine">at twice!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE island became a scene of bustle and hurry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grim-faced artillerymen broke open caissons and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with electric loaders sent home huge sixteen and eigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen-inch radite shells into the hungry maws of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">antiaircraft rifles while the observers and gun pointers</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the battery-command stations trained the huge guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the oncoming craft now barely thirty thousand feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">above them. Gun after gun was served and battery</seg><seg type="columnLine">commander after battery commander reported his piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">in readiness for firing and aligned on the target.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Commandant was again at the window staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the approaching craft. As it came nearer he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, emblazoned on the hull, the sombre colors of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">insignia of the long defunct Russian Union of Soviet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Republics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nashky!" he muttered to himself. "Why the devil</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't they install a Hamilton generator or two here?</seg><seg type="columnLine">These guns will be of no use if he has the same type</seg><seg type="columnLine">of craft as he escaped in!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a final glance at the stranger he moved to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk and locked in the button of his communicator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "All batteries, fire!" he cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a roar that shook the ground the batteries turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose their three and five thousand pound projectiles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The aim of many of them was perfect and the stranger</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared in a smother of smoke and flame from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bursting radite shells. Gradually the smoke was dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sipated and the craft could be seen moving slowly but</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily toward the island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep up the fire 1" cried the Commandant. "What is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter with those generators?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The roar of heavy guns shook the lookout tower</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the welcome hum of Nashky generators did not make</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself heard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why the devil don't you start those generators?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">stormed the Commandant into his communicator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They won't start, sir," came a report at last. "There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is some kind of an interference wave that throws them</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of phase every time we try to get them into</seg><seg type="columnLine">synchronism."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Commandant swore and hastened back to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">window. The stranger was only about three thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet above the island now and was slowly maneuvering</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, gradually getting into the position he wanted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently a puff of smoke came from the hull above.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a gasp, the Commandant watched the nearest bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery. The shell fired from Nashky's craft was a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">one but the havoc it wrought was frightful. It fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a hundred feet of one of the eighteen-inch rifles</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were firing and the huge tube suddenly wilted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fell forward as though it were tallow before a fire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Commandant rubbed his eyes and looked again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What happened to that gun ?" he cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no answer to his question and he trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">his glass on the rifle. There was no doubt that it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">drooped forward as though it were made of lead and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as he watched, the barbette carriage crumpled into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shapeless mass and all that was left of the glittering</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel was a huge amorphous mass spreading slowly over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground. Scattered here and there on the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">were shapeless splotches of color which had been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun crew a few moments before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the gun spoke from Nashky's ship and another</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle near the first began to wilt down while the crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">collapsed as though smitten with lightning. A voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking English with a decided accent sounded from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Commandant's communicator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good evening, General," it said. "I presume that by</seg><seg type="columnLine">now you are aware who I am. In case you are more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than usually dull this evening, I will tell you that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am the Admiral of the air fleet of the World Union of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Soviet Republics. I trust that you are enjoying watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the effects of solvite, my latest contribution to the science</seg><seg type="columnLine">of warfare. Since you may have missed some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">finer points of the demonstration, I will now fire again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and demolish a few more of the rifles which you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">fcegt so many men busy polishing for the last ten years.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAST WAR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">441</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">You will observe in a few shots, the advantages of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">new explosive over the radite with which you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar. I beg you to keep close watch for I am about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fire again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The antiaircraft batteries which had been silent for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few moments resumed their ground-shaking thunder but</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the sound locater which he had trained on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nashky's craft, the Commandant could hear the bark</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the small rifle with which it was armed. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the batteries and watched another huge rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffer the fate which had overtaken the first two and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the crew collapse into immobility as the effects</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the explosion reached them. Again Nashky fired and</seg><seg type="columnLine">another gun and its crew went out of commission. Huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">radite shells were bursting continuously around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacking ship but it suffered no harm from them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cease firing!" shouted the Commandant into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">communicator. "All crews leave their guns and take</seg><seg type="columnLine">refuge in gasproof casements. Keep trying to start those</seg><seg type="columnLine">generators!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have shown real wisdom in your orders, Gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral," came Nashky's mocking voice. "Unfortunately,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasproof casements will not in the least protect your</seg><seg type="columnLine">personnel any more than firing at me will protect your</seg><seg type="columnLine">material. However, I am not in the least interested in</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiping out the garrison of St. Helena--at least, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this time. The real objects of my trip are two. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">is to rescue the prisoners whom you hold here, who are</seg><seg type="columnLine">men whom I know and trust and whom I can depend</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. The other is to compass the destruction of the gene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rators which I was forced to construct and install during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the period of my enforced sojourn as your guest. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">presume that I am safe in assuming that you are sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rendering without terms ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will never surrender!" stormed the Commandant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How sad," cried Nashky in a mocking voice. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">regret that you force me to take extreme measures</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward your unfortunate garrison. I believe, if my</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory serves me right, that the gasproof casement for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Battery Vestoff is close behind the west gun. I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">now drop a solvite shell into it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gun of Nashky's ship spoke again and to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror the Commandant saw the heavy concrete of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasproof casement sag and fall inward in a shapeless</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass. It was evident without further inquiry that none</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gun crew could have survived the shot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is the demonstration sufficient or shall I fire again?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquired Nashky. "I have several thousand shells on</seg><seg type="columnLine">board and I will gladly spend a couple of dozen in</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiping out your garrison if such extreme measures are</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed to convince you of the futility of further re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Commandant hung his head and groaned aloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">in anguish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't take it so hard, General," went on Nashky.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Remember that better men than you have surrendered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me in the past. Believe me, I speak truly when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you that immediate and unconditional surrender is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only means you have of sparing your command a</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiarly unpleasant death. I don't wish to rush your</seg><seg type="columnLine">decision and so I will give you thirty seconds in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">to decide before I start firing again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Commandant groaned again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are your terms?" he asked sadly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's better, General. They are very simple. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the prisoners whom you hold are to be at once released</seg><seg type="columnLine">and conducted to the two transport aerostats on your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">landing field and allowed to embark. They will be fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nished with arms and the regular engineering crews of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the transports will man the ships, but they will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">unarmed. As soon as the embarkation is complete, your</seg><seg type="columnLine">men will be allowed to gather in the vicinity of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing field and remain in the open. They will not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be harmed but I will destroy your antiaircraft rifles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">your Nashky generators before the transports take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. The temptation to fire on them might be greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">than some of your gunners could withstand and I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not care to have any of my countrymen lose their lives.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Since you will no longer have prisoners, you will no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer have any use for the generators and frankly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't care to have Hamilton start pawing them over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulling them apart."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will give up the prisoners to you since I have to,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I will not deliver any of the crews of the transports</seg><seg type="columnLine">to your mercy," cried the Commandant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As you will, General.

His Chief of Staff met</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on the way and the Commandant explained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation in a few words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is no use in sacrificing everyone, Van Nuys,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said.

Tell Wilson to release the prisoners</seg><seg type="columnLine">and arm them. Have the engineering crews of the trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ports mustered before me on the landing field."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Colonel Van Nuys saluted and hastened away and</seg><seg type="columnLine">General Hunter turned his conveyer toward the landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">field. As he reached it and stepped out of the car, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man approached and saluted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sir, may I speak to you ?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it, Captain Hamilton?" asked the Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mandant.

In a few moments the prisoners were armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were marching toward the transports to board them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of the prisoners stopped behind for a moment to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak to the Commandant. As he approached, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">General looked up and recognized Zaneff, the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Premier of Russia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it, Zaneff ?" he asked wearily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "General Hunter, for some time I have known that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this day was coming and I am greatly relieved to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you have come through it unharmed. For ten years</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have been my jailer and your kindness and courtesy</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been unfailing under the most trying circumstances.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wish to thank you, both for myself and for my fellow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners for the many favors you have done for us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to extend to you our hearty wishes that the Court of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inquiry which will sit on the matter will completely ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onerate you. We will be very glad to prepare a statement</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it would help your case any."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tears showed in General Hunter's eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you, Zaneff," he said simply. "There is</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing that you can do for me in the matter. Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">testimony would only be a repetition of what I will say</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself and I believe that my word will not be doubted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thank you and convey my thanks to your comrades for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their thoughtfulness. Good-bye."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zaneff wrung the General heartily by the hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastened toward the waiting Chico. Colonel Van Nuys</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped up and reported that the engineering crews of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Chico and the Kenowis had been mustered. As Gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral Hunter turned to inspect them, the Chief of Staff</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned forward and spoke earnestly into his ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "General," he muttered, "there is something funny</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">going on. One of the crew of the Chico-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I know, Colonel," interrupted the Commandant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is by my authority and with my permission."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Colonel Van Nuys saluted and stepped back and Gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral Hunter carefully inspected the assembled engineers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and confiscated a pistol, the only arm he found. At his</seg><seg type="columnLine">order, the crews repaired to their respective ships and</seg><seg type="columnLine">boarded them and secured the doors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">^ "Colonel Van Nuys, order the entire garrison and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilians to assemble here at the landing field. Everyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">is to come, for Nashky will bombard the island as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as all have assembled."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half an hour later General Hunter stepped to the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">municator in the warehouse office and informed Nashky</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the terms of surrender had been complied with.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well, General," replied Nashky. "What will</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow during the next half hour will be a sight that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">new to the world. Because I wish to have it accurately</seg><seg type="columnLine">reported by trained observers, I will ask that you, Colonel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Van Nuys and Captain Hamilton, your Engineering Of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficer, go to the lookout tower and observe it. You will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be harmed. Notify me when you have arrived."</seg><seg type="columnLine">General Hunter paled slightly but he stepped out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">summoned Colonel Van Nuys and a Captain of Artillery</seg><seg type="columnLine">who bore a slight resemblance in personal appearance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the missing Hamilton and with them proceeded to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookout tower. As he informed Nashky of his where-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abouts, the huge craft above him started to move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nashky had been right when he said that the sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be unique. From the hull of the Russian craft a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small gun spoke from time to time and each time a shell</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell in the vicinity of one of the guarding antiaircraft</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifles of the island and each time the gun melted as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">it were tallow before a fire and both gun and carriage</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread out over the ground in a huge shapeless mass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the guns had been disposed of, Nashky turned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to the huge generators which had guarded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island far more effectively than the guns had. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were twelve of the generators and twelve shells were</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired and the machine lost form and became huge black</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gold stains on the ground. When the destruction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the defenses was complete, Nashky spoke again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My mission has been accomplished, General, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will take my fellow-countrymen away from your care.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kindly report to the military and naval heads of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world what you have witnessed, without exaggeration</seg><seg type="columnLine">and without suppressing any of the details. I would ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vise you to stay away from the vicinity of the spots</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the shells landed if you value your life. Before I</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave your vicinity, I will make one more stipulation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You will not use your general wavelength communica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors nor attempt to give any other form of alarm for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space of three hours after my departure, nor allow it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be done. Will you promise this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will promise nothing more," stormed the Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mandant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your failure to promise will result in the destruction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all buildings on the island, for I am not sure of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">location of all of the communicators. This will leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">your sick without a hospital and all of you without food</seg><seg type="columnLine">or means of asking for aid for some time and would ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAST WAR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">443</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">complish nothing in the end, for I would have more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three hours of start which I am stipulating. I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">give you one minute in which to make up your mind."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You have the whip hand today, Nashky," cried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Commandant. "I will promise, for I have no choice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will live for only one thing; the day when I see you</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanged higher than Haman."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When that day arrives, General, I will cordially in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vite you to be present," said Nashky with a laugh. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will now look out of your window, you will be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wave a last farewell to your prisoners before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> General Hunter glanced at his watch as the Chico</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Kenowis rose from the landing field. The little</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet of vessels moved off to the northeast at an elevation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of twelve thousand feet, the huge Russian craft rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">far above them until it was out of sight, even to his field</seg><seg type="columnLine">glasses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What time is it?" he demanded sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two hours and forty-two minutes before we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">give an alarm, sir," replied Colonel Van Nuys. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">had better lie down for a few minutes, General, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">look fagged. I'll see that you are at the communicator</seg><seg type="columnLine">Teady to send out an alarm as soon as the time limit has</seg><seg type="columnLine">expired."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"TTERE they come!" cried Colonel Van Nuys.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A X General Hunter stepped to the window and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up. A hundred tiny scouting aerostats spotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky in all directions, serving as a screen for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet of heavier craft which formed the first line of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fense for the oncoming fleet. The cruisers swung over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island and took up position, grim and stationary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounding the flagship from whose peak streamed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">colors of the Chief of Staff of the United States. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an inspiring sight and one which thrilled the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">warrior to the bottom of his heart. He straightened up</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment, his hand at the salute, but a cloud passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his brow and he seemed to slump suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They make a wonderful show, don't they, General ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Colonel Van Nuys.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Show? Yes, they do," replied the General bitterly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but that is all they are--a show--a vain show. Nashky</seg><seg type="columnLine">could destroy them all in an hour with his one ship and</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it without danger to himself. There goes the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">municator. Tell them to drop to the center of the land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing field. I'll go to meet them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Directed by Colonel Van Nuys, the flagship of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American fleet dropped gracefully to a landing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">General Munroe, Chief of Staff of the United States,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped out and acknowledged the salute of General</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hunter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, Hunter," he said cheerfully as he stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward and shook hands with the Commandant. "So</seg><seg type="columnLine">your birds have flown, have they ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without answering, General Hunter unhooked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sabre and handed it to General Munroe. The Chief of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Staff took it with an air of surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's this, Hunter?" he asked as he examined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon closely. "Has this some bearing on the escape ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is my sabre, sir," replied General Hunter. "I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed in my command and I am tendering it voluntarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than have you ask me for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> General Munroe turned on his subordinate sharply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't be an ass, Hunter," he said. "When I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">your sabre, I'll ask for it and not before. Buck up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">man," he went on kindly, "no one blames you for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">escape. I know your record well enough to stake my</seg><seg type="columnLine">commission that you did all that human ingenuity could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do to foil it. No one can fight that devil Nashky. Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, we'll go up to the lookout tower and see what</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened. Tell us about it as we go. You know Hamil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, don't you, Hunter?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Commandant shook hands with the famous in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventor of the Hamilton generator which had been instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental in bringing about the downfall of Nashky and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cohorts a decade earlier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did Nashky take any one with him except the pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oners ?" asked General Munroe as the party made their</seg><seg type="columnLine">way toward the lookout tower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He took the engineering crews of both the Chico and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kenowis with him as prisoners.

So far as could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be told from reports from aerial patrols and commercial</seg><seg type="columnLine">liners all over the world, the fleet commandeered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nashky had dropped out of sight. No one had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">any such craft, but in view of the fact that the air lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">were as well mapped out as the ocean routes had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half century earlier, this was not surprising. All that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nashky had to do was to go between the regular traffic</seg><seg type="columnLine">lanes and he could have kept out of sight for months.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, there seems to be nothing more that we can do</seg><seg type="columnLine">here," said General Munroe when he had heard the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port. "The President is calling a conference of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">military heads of the nations which allied to fight Russia</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, at Honolulu, and we might as well get along in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that direction.

Van Nuys, when General Gilmore</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets here, turn everything over to him and cooperate in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every way possible. He will have a crew equipped for</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas work and he will examine the places where the shells</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell and take samples. In the meanwhile, let no one ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proach them.

General</seg><seg type="columnLine">Munroe looked at them and sighed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wish that we had a thousand of those generator</seg><seg type="columnLine">carriers," he said, to General Hamilton. "They are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only ships in the fleet that are worth anything when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes to attacking Nashky in the kind of a craft that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">has. There is one good thing about the matter, though,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nashky's ship is not equipped for much offensive work</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside from bomb dropping."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "His old ones were not," replied Hamilton, "but no</seg><seg type="columnLine">offense other than bomb dropping was needed at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. I rather expect that his present ship will surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">us by its offensive power. Remember those rifles on</seg><seg type="columnLine">St. Helena?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So far as gun fire goes, I am not afraid of a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his craft," replied Munroe. "We can certainly out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight him and hold him up long enough to get one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your generators bearing on his craft and that is the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the battle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you talking about, Hamilton? It took you</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than ten minutes to down four of them ten years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is true, General, but remember that the Hamil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton generator was as big a surprise to Nashky as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nashky aircraft was to us. Now he is forewarned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have no doubt that he has prepared a defense against</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. It is nine years since he escaped and no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows what a brain of the power of his may not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolved during that period."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You z.re unduly pessimistic, Hamilton. I will admit</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Nashky is a genius, but there are limits to his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">power. Even he cannot do the impossible. At any</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate, I would like nothing better than to have his ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">show up right now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Communications Officer of the flagship hastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and saluted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A scout has reported the presence of a strange craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unknown design and flying no colors straight ahead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir," he reported. "It is at an altitude of about thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet and is descending rapidly and heading</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the fleet. The scout requests instructions."</seg><seg type="columnLine">General Munroe hastened to the signal room of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flagship and received in person a confirmation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scout's report. Before the excited Lieutenant could give</seg><seg type="columnLine">the details of the appearance of the stranger, other but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tons in the signal room began to glow and a dozen other</seg><seg type="columnLine">scouts were repeating the information. A cruiser was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered forward to investigate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The commander of the cruiser was a veteran of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last war with Russia and as soon as he arrived within</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of the strange craft, he reported it as being of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same type as those which Nashky had launched against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wprld a decade before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now I am converted to a belief in Santa Claus,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried General Munroe as he slapped General Hamilton</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the back. "What could be sweeter? The old fox has</seg><seg type="columnLine">run his head into a steel trap this time. He must think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we have no Hamilton generators with us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am not so sure of that," replied Hamilton du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">biously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, quit your croaking. Just wait and see the fun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This scrap will be over before it is well started."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned to the Communications Officer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Order all scouts to attack at close range. They won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">do any good, but they'll keep him busy while the gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erator carriers slip up on him. As soon as the scouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack, the cruisers will approach and go into action with</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke-shell to hide the approach of the generator car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riers. This ship will take elevation to thirty thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and watch the fun."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The flagship rose above the balance of the fleet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hovered at an elevation of six miles. Two miles lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cruisers swung into battle formation and headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">west. The flagship followed, above and slightly behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main fleet. Presently a dark spot made its appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance ahead. As the fleet advanced, the spot was resolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a craft even larger than the flagship surrounded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cloud of what looked like tiny insects. The little</seg><seg type="columnLine">scouts darted in and out,, weaving continuously and</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping up a hail of machine gun bullets and thirty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven millimeter radite shells toward the larger mass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it ignored its attackers as a whale would have ig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nored the attack of a school of minnows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is a Nashky ship, all right," exclaimed Munroe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Six propellers and no elevating fans. Wait until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruisers get into action and then you'll see some fun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as he spoke the cruiser column arrived within</seg><seg type="columnLine">range and swinging sharply to the left, began to pour</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadsides of six- and eight-inch shells toward their</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarry. In a moment Nashky's ship was hidden from</seg><seg type="columnLine">view in a smother of smoke and flaming radite and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scouts, their mission accomplished, drew off and left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the battle to the heavier craft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He can't see through that haze," exulted Munroe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Look, Hamilton, there go the generator carriers. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch her come tumbling down!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two of the huge generator carriers moved off to each</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the Nashky ship and stole toward the cloud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAST WAR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">445</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Nashky craft occupying the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scene, the four generator carriers</seg><seg type="columnLine">closing rapidly in, their projector tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained on their opponent while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineers rapidly ran their generators</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and down the frequency scale, try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to hit the key note of the primary</seg><seg type="columnLine">generators of the Nashky craft. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who had watched the great battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the North Atlantic ten years before</seg><seg type="columnLine">where four such craft had been hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to destruction in a few minutes, the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sult seemed inevitable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Nearer and nearer approached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">generator carriers and General Munroe</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained his ears in an attempt to hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tell tale momentary silence from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nashky craft that would show that one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the attacking generators was tuned</seg><seg type="columnLine">correctly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "They'll get him in a minute!" he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      General Hamilton beside him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      watched intently, but while</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      Munroe's expression was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      one of supreme confi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The generator carrier was</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling!

The attacking ships approached until only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand yards separated them from their quarry before</seg><seg type="columnLine">any signs of offensive action came from the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nashky. Suddenly a puff of smoke came from the hull</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sombre craft and a small shell was seen to burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the tough armor plate skin of the leading genera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor carrier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He'll have to use heavier metal than that if he hopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do any damage," exulted General Munroe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> General Hamilton made no reply but the lines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry in his face grew deeper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good God!" he exclaimed, "Munroe, do you see that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It can't be true!" cried the Chief of Staff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rubbed his eyes and looked again. The generator</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrier was falling! Not only was it falling, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">also losing form and identity and was slowly turning into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shapeless black blob of substance which was gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">assuming a spherical shape as it plunged toward the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">below. General Hamilton leaped to the communicator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All ships fire I" he shouted. "Smoke if you have it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or radite or anything handy, but fire! Blind him before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he can fire again!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A bustle of activity arose in the cruisers, but Hamil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's orders had come too late. Before a shell was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired by the American fleet, the gun on the Nashky had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired three more times and the American fleet's genera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor carriers were wrecked. Down into the Atlantic they</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged to destruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE cruisers were firing now and the Russian ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hidden from view in a cloud of smoke and flam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing radite, but it was no longer passive. Forward through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cloud it relentlessly pressed. As it came momen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarily out of the smoke, a gun spoke from it again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the American fleet was left to mourn one of its finest</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruisers. Not daunted by the fate of their comrades,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the American cruisers attacked with fury, but time and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, the single gun of the Nashky sent forth a mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage of death and destruction and ship after ship lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">form and plunged, an amorphous mass, into the hungry</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a dozen of his finest cruisers and all of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">generator carriers gone, there was but one thing left for</seg><seg type="columnLine">General Munroe to do and he did it. He ordered a gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral retreat. In orderly lines, the American fleet drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">sullenly off and then the real supremacy of the Nashky</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship became evident. Forward it charged at a speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater than could be attained by any but the fastest</seg><seg type="columnLine">scouts of the Americans. No longer was it firing only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one gun. From a dozen portholes came puffs of smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the gunnery was deadly in its accuracy. Ship after</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship took the last fatal plunge into oblivion. The Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cans tried to fly; they broke up into a dozen detachments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the relentless fire of the Nashky followed them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not until the last of the cruisers which made up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the backbone of the finest air fleet in the world had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed that the firing ceased. Aside from a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">scouts which were splitting the air at maximum speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the scene of the conflict, the air was clear ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept for the flagship and the ominous Nashky. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">black craft rose and approached the flagship and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Navigating Officer looked toward General Munroe for</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stay where you are," he said bitterly. "There is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">use in trying to run or to fight. Let's take our medicine</seg><seg type="columnLine">like men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nearer and nearer came the ominous craft until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">emblem of the long dead Russian Union of Soviet Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">publics could be plainly seen on its hull. The button</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the flagship's communicator began to glow and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Communications Officer switched his receiver to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">audiator in order that all could hear. A smooth oily</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, speaking English with a noticeable accent, filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good afternoon, General Munroe," it said. "Ah, yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is my old friend, General Hamilton. How do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">do, Hamilton? And how are you, General Hunter?

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">month of hopeless fighting and of heroism unparalleled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ivan Nashky had made good his threat. Apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">human life was doomed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The council of the nations had met in gloom. Gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral Gilmore and his crew had visited St. Helena and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried vainly to secure samples of material from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrecked guns. The most efficient gas protection which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been developed proved to be worthless and man after</seg><seg type="columnLine">man of the crew died as they risked and gave their lives</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the attempts. It was not even possible to recover</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bodies. When daring men tried with long poles to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hook the bodies out, the deadly infection ran up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">handles of the poles, rendering them soft as putty and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">several cases, where the men had not been able to drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">the poles and retreat in time, they too were caught and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disintegrated into shapeless masses before the horrified</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze of their comrades.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nor did this sad news alone account for the gloom</seg><seg type="columnLine">which pervaded the discussions. Nashky had not waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">long before putting his threats into operation. The after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon of the first day of the council meeting, his ship ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared over London. Ships of the British Royal Air</seg><seg type="columnLine">Force had sallied forth to do battle but were hurled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground, one by one, in ruins. Three generator car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riers had been among the attackers but their fate was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">different from that of the other ships. When the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fenders had been cleared from the air, a bomb was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped on London and the black craft departed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Television reproduced the scenes of horror in London</seg><seg type="columnLine">all over the world and the other cities saw huge buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">topple and subside into shapeless masses of matter while</seg><seg type="columnLine">people dropped like flies and disintegrated where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell. At first the destruction was purely local and</seg><seg type="columnLine">centered about the point where the bomb had landed but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was soon observed to be spreading. Brave men sallied</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the scene of the catastrophe and measured the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate of spread. It proved to be about twelve hundred and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty yards per hour, about seventeen miles a day. As it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take nearly two years for the infection to cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world at that rate and as it was almost certain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the virulence of the attack would decrease as the area</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew larger, a momentary sense of relief was felt. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed certain that long before two years could pass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some means of combating the contagion would be found.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The best scientists of the world were hurried off to</seg><seg type="columnLine">London to observe the phenomena. They were unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go directly above the infected area for it soon became</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident that the infection was spreading in a hemispheri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal wave from the point of origin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time the rate of progression and related data</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been obtained, the black craft had appeared over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rome and, ruthlessly destroying all aircraft which at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacked it, had dropped another bomb and departed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fresh gloom spread over the world and as the days</seg><seg type="columnLine">went by, a feeling of utter hopelessness and despondency</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread almost as rapidly as did the effects of the solvite.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The black herald of death appeared from time to time</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dropped a single bomb and departed. Nor could any</seg><seg type="columnLine">man tell when the communicator buttons would glow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nashky's taunting voice announce a new point of attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">and prophesy fresh horrors for suffering humanity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every attempt to combat the black ship had been un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">successful and every effort to determine the cause of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious disintegration of matter under the influence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of solvite had been equally futile. There was no start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing point from which to work and the time came when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heads of such governments as were still functioning</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered their flyers to cease from vain attacks and useless</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacrifice of men and ships and to keep their aerostats in</seg><seg type="columnLine">readiness to transport the population away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">various points of attack. For a time this method pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vented much loss of life but as the number of areas de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">void of life and incapable of supporting it increased,</seg><seg type="columnLine">people became huddled together in the remaining safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">areas where they starved and sickened and died from</seg><seg type="columnLine">disease like flies; pressed closer and closer together each</seg><seg type="columnLine">day by the encroaching areas of death and not knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at what moment Nashky's ship would appear in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens above and drop a bomb into the middle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrowing strip of ground where they were huddled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All of Europe and Australia and most of Asia and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Americas had already been desolated while communica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions from Africa had ceased and the air lanes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed by the mounting solvite. The government of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States, in common with those of the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world had ceased to function and the only semblance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">control over the actions of the people left alive was exer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cised by a little group of scientists assembled at Pole</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mountain, Wyoming, based upon the Serumology Labo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ratory presided over by Feodor Balinsky. For some un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known reason, possibly a spark of feeling for the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had so vitally aided him in his previous attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">conquer the world, Nashky had in his raids, avoided the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vicinity of Pole Mountain. Again, it may have been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling of hatred for his old comrade in arms which led</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to spare him to the last and thus prolong his torture.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whatever the cause, the fact existed and there, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart of the Wyoming country, were gathered together</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greatest brains of the age and from there emanated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the few messages to which the remnant of mankind paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">heed and from there intrepid adventurers sallied forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gave their lives uselessly in trying out new methods</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they hoped would combat the plague.</seg><seg type="columnLine">448</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such was the situation when General Hamilton, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was naturally one of the little group there assembled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">received the message which spelled hope of continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, and which might, if they could get more time, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">spell the ruin of Nashky's terrible plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Chico rose from the landing field at St. Helena</seg><seg type="columnLine">and soared to a height of twelve thousand feet be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the navigator gave the orders which started the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pellers and drove the ship toward the east at her maxi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mum cruising speed of six hundred miles an hour. Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain Hamilton, in his assumed role of Chief Engineer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strode through the hull watching the small atomic engines</seg><seg type="columnLine">which drove both the propellers and the elevating fans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The crew of the Chico knew their business and he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to criticize for a few minutes. Presently he</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed one of the oilers oiling a commutator bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he hastened over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep oil out of that commutator!" he snapped.

Look at me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He whirled the oiler sharply around. The man hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head, but the Captain twisted sharply on his shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with a grimace of pain the oiler looked up. Hamil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton released his grasp and stepped back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good God!" he muttered in an undertone, "Jane</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hunter!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Commandant's daughter glanced swiftly around.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't give me away, Charley," she whispered hastily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am not ready to have my identity disclosed yet."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How on earth did you get aboard?" he asked won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deringly. "Your father inspected the crews before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">embarked.

Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hamilton had no access to the charts but an occasional</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance at the tachometer and repeater compass on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine room wall gave him the data on which to base a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough idea of the course. They were evidently avoiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of the regular traffic lanes and were cutting northeast</seg><seg type="columnLine">across Africa toward the great unknown regions in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">heart of Asia. Hoping to learn something of their desti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation, he entered the control room and spoke to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Russian who was navigating the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How long will we be aloft, sir?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Russian looked at him coldly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why do you wish to know ?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our fuel supply is not overabundant and we are not</seg><seg type="columnLine">running at our most economical speed. If we have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very long trip before us, it would be better to reduce</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed a couple of hundred miles an hour."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How many hours' supply of fuel have you at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About twelve hours without touching the emergency</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And using them ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Five hours additional for the elevating fans alone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One hour and a half for the fans and the propellers at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this speed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That will be sufficient."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Over twelve hours, but less than thirteen and a half</seg><seg type="columnLine">at six hundred miles an hour," he reflected. "Just about</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I thought; the middle of the Gobi desert. Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he couldn't have chosen a better hiding place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hour after hour the transports forged ahead. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular fuel supply ran low and under Hamilton's direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions the emergency tanks were cut in. A half hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">later the engine room communicator button glowed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">an order came from the control room to reduce to quarter</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed. Hamilton glanced out of a forward porthole</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a hundred miles ahead saw an atomic searchlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">blink and throw a beam straight up for an instant and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then vanish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A blinking beacon," he said to himself. "There is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">traffic lane or landing around here so it must mark our</seg><seg type="columnLine">destination."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His surmise was correct and forty-five minutes later</seg><seg type="columnLine">the transport was landed and a guard of Russians ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared at the door of the engine room and ordered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew to follow them. As they stepped out on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, Hamilton paused in amazement at the sight that</seg><seg type="columnLine">met his gaze. They had landed in a range of mountains</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Hamilton later decided were the Alashans, but at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time he had no eyes for them. Standing alone in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rugged scenery was a huge dome of silvery material</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully nine hundred yards in diameter and a hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty yards high. There was no sign of windows in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dome but from the crest projected the end of an optical</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument of some sort and on the ground level were</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge panels with smaller ones inset in them after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner of sliding doors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another detachment of men moved up and Hamilton</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced around and saw that the Kenowis had landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside them and that it was the crew of the sister trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port who had joined them. The strange black craft which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had wrought the destruction at St. Helena stood near</seg><seg type="columnLine">by and Hamilton marveled at the huge proportions of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he watched, the large panels of the dome moved si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lently back and he saw that they were indeed doors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The black craft was raised a few inches from the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a number of men came from the interior of the dome</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started to tow it inside. A glance showed him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were Mongolians of the nomad tribes which in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">habited the Gobi.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before his startled gaze the Chico and the Kenowis</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved and rose a few inches in the air, although the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevation fans were motionless. He glanced down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that each transport had been landed on a sheet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAST WAR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">449</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">silvery material which resembled the walls of the dome.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Other crews started to tow the two ships toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great dome. He watched the performance for a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a sharp command from the leader of the Russians</seg><seg type="columnLine">started the prisoners toward the doorway of the dome.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inside, Hamilton found that the entrance did not lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the dome itself but into a huge compartment made</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the same material as the dome and that a door similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the one through which he had made his way con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fronted him. The outer door slid shut and the inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">one opened and the prisoners marched through it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brilliantly lighted interior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dome had been erected over a huge stone building,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortress-like in its appearance. Surrounding the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">building were numerous skin tents of the common Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">golian type and Hamilton surmised that they were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwellings of the Mongolians he had seen. The prisoners</seg><seg type="columnLine">were marched into the stone building and to a large cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tral room where, enthroned on a dais, sat Ivan Nashky.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Russian stared at them in silence for a few minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have declared war on the world," he said abruptly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I have only a few followers and many of them are</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages; excellent fighting men in their crude way, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">not readily adaptable. I can use a few good engineers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If you care to enlist in my service to fight against your</seg><seg type="columnLine">countrymen, you may have the status of slaves. If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not, you will be killed. What is your choice ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR a moment there was silence, broken by the Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">Engineer of the Kenowis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your fate might be made easier when you are finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">defeated if you held us as hostages," he suggested. "Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, none of us will join you on any terms."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My final defeat?" laughed Nashky. "It may interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to know that I have just returned from destroying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Eastern battle fleet of the United States which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">commanded by no less a person than General Munroe</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. Only one ship escaped destruction and I spared</seg><seg type="columnLine">it deliberately. You have chosen your fate, sir, let the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others speak for themselves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Hamilton stepped forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will throw in my lot with you gladly," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And so will I," said Jane as she stepped to his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I," added an engineer from the Kenowis' crew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are there any others?" demanded Nashky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Chief Engineer of the Kenowis stepped forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spat deliberately in Captain Hamilton's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is my answer to your treachery," he snarled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I choose death!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without a word, Hamilton launched his fist toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of his assailant. The blow hit full on the chin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Chief Engineer staggered and went down. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did so, Hamilton leaped forward and kicked him brutally</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take that as pay for the dog's life you led me while</seg><seg type="columnLine">I served under you," he shouted. "And that, and that 1"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He delivered other kicks at the prostrate figure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nashky smiled approvingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well done," he chuckled. "You are a man of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">true faith. Are there any others ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no reply and Nashky nodded toward a</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of Mongolians who stood beside his dais, ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently as guards. They stepped forward and seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">the luckless crew and marched them forth. Nashky</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned his attention to the group of three who remained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are content to remain as slaves?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On any terms that give me a chance to strike a blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the tyrants who have so long oppressed me," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hamilton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jane and the engineer from the Kenowis nodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">assent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good!" exclaimed Nashky rubbing his hands. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be accepted on that status, but if your performance</seg><seg type="columnLine">is equal to your talk, you may be raised from that rank</seg><seg type="columnLine">and become freemen and my comrades in arms. Take</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to a cell for the present."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another group of guards stepped forward and led</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three to a small cell set in the recesses of the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of the building. As the door crashed shut behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, the engineer of the Kenowis turned to Hamilton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was well done, Captain Hamilton," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Poor old Owens, it almost broke his heart to think that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Chief Engineer would be a traitor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who the devil are you?" demanded Hamilton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Williams, United States Secret Service," replied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer with a grin. "My errand is the same as yours.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who is your partner?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hamilton shook hands warmly with the Secret Service</seg><seg type="columnLine">Operative.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is Miss Jane Hunter, General Hunter's daugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter," he said. "She stowed away on board in the hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">of becoming a second Ilga Vestoff."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She won't have much chance if her sex is dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered," replied Williams as he shook hands with Jane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nashky is a more cold-blooded fish than Balinsky was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, Captain, what are your plans?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None until we see how the land lies. The only thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we can do is to seem to enter heartily into Nashky's</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans and hope that we can learn something worth com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">municating and find a chance of doing it. I have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">on watch for fourteen hours, so the first thing I need is</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep. If you'll pardon me, I'll turn in for a little while</seg><seg type="columnLine">before they come to put us to work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He threw himself down on one of the three cots with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the cell was provided and almost instantly dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">off to sleep. His companions soon followed his example</seg><seg type="columnLine">and quiet reigned in the little cell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CAPTAIN HAMILTON swung Jane Hunter behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and fired his heavy automatic three times at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oncoming Mongolians. At short range, the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">radite-charged bullets from the weapon penetrated three</seg><seg type="columnLine">or four men before losing their energy and the slaughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">inflicted by the three shots momentarily halted the ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This way, Charley," cried Williams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hamilton fired twice more and then turned and ran in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the direction which Williams had indicated, being careful</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep his body between Jane and the Mongolians. Ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently they were not armed with pistols or rifles for</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a shot was fired at them, but as they retreated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance of their enemies was resumed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Around a corner they dashed and found Williams</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing before an open panel in the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This way 1" he cried and they followed him in. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the leading Mongolians had rounded the comer, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">panel slid noiselessly shut and the fugitives were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take my hand," directed Williams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They followed him silently through a long stretch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness.

It is fairly roomy, yet small enough to defend</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily. I managed to smuggle enough supplies into it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">last the three of us for several months. Now to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether the way is clear/'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He drew a pocket X-ray torch from his pocket and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed a button, directing the beam on the wall before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. A spot on the wall slowly grew misty and then dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared. Through the hole thus created the three gazed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The room before them was empty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right/' exclaimed Williams. "I am going to open</seg><seg type="columnLine">the panel.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were halfway up when a shout came from the room be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low. Hamilton glanced back and saw a dozen Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">golians led by a Russian streaming through a doorway</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the room below. He raised his pistol and fired</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, Charley!" cried Williams from the stairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">above him. "Don't waste time in shooting.

Across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof they raced and into the lookout tower. A Russian</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocked their way but a shot from Williams' pistol dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed of the last obstacle and they entered the tower and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolted its massive door behind them just as the foremost</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their pursuers burst open the door leading to the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">and poured forth in pursuit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold them off for a minute with your pistol, Char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley/' cried Williams as the door clanged shut. "There's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine gun on the other wall that I'll have in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hamilton fired rapidly and accurately but more of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mongolians appeared momentarily in the doorway and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leaders of the rush had almost reached the door of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tower when a crackle of machine-gun fire came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his side and the attacking wave withered and crumpled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Mongolians dropping like flies before the deadly rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of radite-charged bullets.

I hadn't seen either of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you face to face for a week for I didn't dare to risk</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicion by looking you up, but I kept tabs on both of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you by means of an X-ray television set in the labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory. I happened to be watching Jane when she tore her</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt and I switched into the magazine wavelength and</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned Charley before I started out to try and rescue</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. I had located this place and stored it over a week</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago..and had it.all planned to.make a break for it soon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I wanted to stay in the. laboratory until I learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to neutralize the solvite.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have learned this much, however; it is not permanent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The effect begins to diminish in about ninety days and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred days it entirely passes away. I learned a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">good deal about Nashky's plans. He plans to let the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solvite run its course until only a few small areas are</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear of it and then to visit these areas and capture</seg><seg type="columnLine">women and bring them here.

Often</seg><seg type="columnLine">men had fought against time to save their lives, but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the first time that men had fought against time with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fate of all life on the planet depending upon the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sults of their labors. The first task had been to protect</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laboratory against the approach of the solvite which</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that time was less than seventy-two hours away. Ba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">linsky had a small amount of palladium among his stores</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was hurriedly alloyed with duralumin by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metallurgists while huge air compressors were started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquefy the air in order that the argon could, by a se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ries of fractional distillations, be extracted from it. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply was soon obtained and the ingots of palladium-</seg><seg type="columnLine">452</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">duralumin alloy were annealed in the manner which Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liams had described. When the process was finished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ingots were rolled into huge sheets, paper thin, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">these were secured to a framework to make a hemi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spherical dome over the laboratory and the surrounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">grounds. The work was accomplished just in time for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air had hardly been replaced with a mixture of argon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and oxygen before observers reported that the solvite</seg><seg type="columnLine">infection had reached them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The task of constructing double locks was pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward and double doors of such a size that a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">. aerostat could be safely let out into outer air were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed. The construction of an aerostat with propellers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and elevating fans of the precious alloy and armored</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a skin of it was the next step. The matter of bush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings and housings for the propellers and elevating fans</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered some mechanical problems but they were solved</seg><seg type="columnLine">and eventually the projected craft, fully manned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipped, among other things with a huge detonation</seg><seg type="columnLine">projector, had sallied forth and taken the air and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">started toward the base in the Gobi desert from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nashky operated. There had been no difficulty in find-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it. At full speed the armored aerostat drove toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, to be met two miles away by Nashky's black menace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nearer and nearer the two ships ranged. Through bi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noculars, General Hamilton looked out through a port</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which a gentle stream of argon was blown,</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving back the poisoned nitrogen which would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned the ship and crew into shapeless masses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter had it penetrated into the interior. His eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">glued on a gun port in the forward end of the Nashky</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft while at his side an engineer kept the detonation</seg><seg type="columnLine">projector, set at 75XC/2, carefully trained on the on-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming craft. Presently the gun port slid open and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muzzle of a three-inch rifle projected out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fire!" exclaimed General Hamilton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineer closed a switch and a dull report shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aerostat. The engineer released the lever and closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it again and once more the dull boom sounded. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">second detonation was unnecessary. Even before it</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded it was evident that the black ship was falling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fascinated, General Hamilton and the engineer watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mighty fabric lose shape and plunge, an amorphqus</seg><seg type="columnLine">globule of black and silver, to the ground, where it spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly over the ground like a ball of tallow melting be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore a hot fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sic transit gloria mundi!" exclaimed General Hamil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton as he watched the doom of the mighty engine of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction which had depopulated an entire world, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed by the very power which it had employed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work its evil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The black monster disposed of, the rescue ship turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">its attention to the great dome of silvery material which</seg><seg type="columnLine">loomed before it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If that skin is as thin as the one at Pole Mountain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can ram right through it," remarked the navigator of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aerostat as he joined the General.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I doubt if it is, but we can try," replied the General.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Full speed ahead!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The aerostat leaped forward at a tremendous speed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nearer and nearer to the dome it came. It seemed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it were about to strike when, a few feet from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the silver metal, the ship came to a halt with a shock</seg><seg type="columnLine">which nearly caved in the bows. Despite the utmost</seg><seg type="columnLine">power that could be coaxed from the atomic engines, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">«mjnch nearer to the shining skin could the ship get.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course!" cried General Hamilton. "We should</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have expected a protective film of energy from a battery</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Nashky generators.

This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the basis, as you all know, of the present method of</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing tissue to replace that destroyed or removed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the living body. The replacement of portions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh or skin has been commonplace for thirty years</seg><seg type="columnLine">and during the last decade the medical profession has</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced to such a state that even whole limbs have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been successfully manufactured and grafted upon living</seg><seg type="columnLine">persons.

Doctor Ruthven,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know more about the rare gases of the atmosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">than anyone else. Tell us what you know about argon."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The aged British scientist rose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lord Rayleigh," he said, "was the first to observe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, while specimens of oxygen and other gases made</seg><seg type="columnLine">purposely from various sources always had the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">density, nitrogen was an exception. One litre of nitro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gen made from air, and supposed to be pure, weighed</seg><seg type="columnLine">1.2573 grams. When the gas was manufactured by de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">composition of various compounds, such as urea and</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain oxides of nitrogen, the mean weight of a litre was</seg><seg type="columnLine">always found to be 1.2505 grams. This difference,</seg><seg type="columnLine">amounting to about seven milligrams, was much greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">than could be accounted for on the hypothesis of experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental error and Rayleigh suspected that some heavier</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas was present in atmospheric nitrogen. In 1894, Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">William, then Professor, Ramsey obtained pure argon</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the removal of the greatly preponderating nitrogen</seg><seg type="columnLine">by means of magnesium. This new gas had a density,</seg><seg type="columnLine">referred to the base of oxygen equals thirty-two, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty-nine, point nine, more than one-third heavier than</seg><seg type="columnLine">nitrogen. Its molecule consists of one atom, hence its</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic and molecular weights are the same. When lique-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied, it boils at--186° C. and when frozen, it melts at--</seg><seg type="columnLine">189.5°C. Aside from the facts which I have given you,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">little if anything is known about it. It has never been</seg><seg type="columnLine">found to enter into any form of chemical combination.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In fact, its name signifies this fact, for it comes from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Greek word, agyo?, meaning inactive or lazy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have attempts ever been made to activate it and make</seg><seg type="columnLine">it enter into chemical combinations?" asked Balinsky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not in recent years, to the best of my knowledge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing was expected to be gained from such a combina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and I think that little, if any work has been done</seg><seg type="columnLine">along these lines."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As I understand it, the gas more nearly resembles</seg><seg type="columnLine">nitrogen than any other, except for its failure to enter</seg><seg type="columnLine">into chemical combinations."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In a broad way, yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you think that you could make it enter into</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemical combinations with the valence and character-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istics of nitrogen?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Possibly. By occluding it in platinum and exposing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to radium emanations or to a high tension arc at</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous temperatures, it might be activated.

If you succeed in acti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vating it to the extent to which nitrogen is activated, will</seg><seg type="columnLine">it not, in all probability, be as readily affected by solvite</seg><seg type="columnLine">as nitrogen is?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Such may be the case but should it prove to be so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are no worse off than we would be if we constructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">our synthetic men on a nitrogen base to start with. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will initiate your experiments at once, Doctor Ruth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ven, I will be in a better position to predict the ultimate</seg><seg type="columnLine">success or failure of mine. In any event, for the benefit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the persons assembled here, I will announce something</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I had intended to give out just about the time that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this great trouble came on us all. My students and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have actually succeeded in creating life in the laboratory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That is, we have artificially made from inert substances,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tissues of many sorts which have lived and multiplied</seg><seg type="columnLine">under laboratory conditions. We have even gone so far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to create a ball of tissue which we have covered with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin and exposed to sunlight and air and it has lived,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved, taken nourishment through its skin, exhibited</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of the phenomena of metabolism, including that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">excreting waste products through the pores, and has</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued to live, thrive and grow larger for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">months. Consequently, with Von Helmer's assistance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I feel confident of our ultimate success in creating a liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing body, in physical characteristics, at least, resembling</seg><seg type="columnLine">a human being. Whether we will be able to substitute</seg><seg type="columnLine">argon for nitrogen in its tissues, I cannot predict and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether the being we create will be a rational thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">being, I cannot state, but at least, gentlemen, we will do</seg><seg type="columnLine">our best."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "May I ask just one thing, Balinsky?" spoke up Von</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helmer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly."</seg><seg type="columnLine">454</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you ever read Mary Wolstencroft Shelley's</seg><seg type="columnLine">book, 'Frankenstein' ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have a copy and before you start your experiments</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will ask of you as a favor that you read it.

Given a machine shop and the materials</seg><seg type="columnLine">which lie wanted, a few days would have seen the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the whole task but he was continually forced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">improvise and substitute. His first model failed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry the wave over five feet and he was forced to tear</seg><seg type="columnLine">it down and start fresh in an attempt to make his appara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tus more powerful. He worked fourteen hours a day</seg><seg type="columnLine">at it while Jane Hunter and Williams stood guard, eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours at a stretch. The strain was telling on all of them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Hamilton was doing his best and all of them tight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened up their belts and stuck grimly to their tasks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost daily some attempt was made to take them by</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise, but the quick challenge of the one on guard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a prompt showing of the dreaded radite bomb was</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to put their attackers to flight. After six weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unremitting labor, Hamilton threw down his tools one</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening and announced that his task was completed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will it work, Charley?" asked Jane as she looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crude machine before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will," he replied. "I have had hopes for a week</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it would, but I said nothing until I had it completed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tested. It is not very powerful but it will project a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave as far as the limits of the duralumin screen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have reconstructed my fuse to make it exceptionally</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensitive.

Jane can slip out and get over the roof in a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">few moments and then slip down to the generator room</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and plant the bomb and get back to the roof without</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">much chance of being detected. From there it is easy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sailing for we can cover her retreat with the guns and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with the solvite bomb, if we find it necessary."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When shall I make the attempt?" asked Jane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As soon as we can get the generators located is as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">good a time as any, I guess.

"Listen!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three sat in tense silence. For a moment nothing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was heard and then Williams spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There it is again. It sounds like Charley's voice</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from a distance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With an exclamation of disbelief Hamilton sprang to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his feet and dashed to the other side of the room. At-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tached to the useless communicator was the little inter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ference piercer which he had attached months before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He picked it up in a gingerly manner and pressed it to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it, Charley ?" cried Jane excitedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hush!

I want to hear this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He listened intently for several minutes and then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dropped the disc and picked up some tools.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you doing?" asked Williams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't interrupt.

"Our messages got</seg><seg type="columnLine">through just in time. So far as Bob knows, the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">world has gone under with the exception of this place</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Pole Mountain.

Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">says that they have got reinforcements from some place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I couldn't make out where, and they are ready to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">another attempt on this place.

I don't know how thick the doors are.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	am afraid that you couldn't ram successfully, if that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you are planning on.

The Nashky gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erators ? Don't worry. We have our plans all made to</seg><seg type="columnLine">put them out of business. Can Nashky tap this device</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hear what we are saying? No? Good enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then I can talk. Wait at least twenty-four hours. Keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">us advised of where you are and keep far enough from</seg><seg type="columnLine">here so that a sound locator can't get your elevating</seg><seg type="columnLine">fans. When you get the word from us, come ahead as</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast as you can. We'll put the generators out of business</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that you can blow the shell with radite. If we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky, you will be able to get to us and take us on board</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the argon is dissipated enough to let the solvite</seg><seg type="columnLine">start work on us. Never mind trying to do Nashky</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his crew, the solvite will take care of them as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you blow this shell.

As long as this base</seg><seg type="columnLine">stays here, you are in constant danger. Yes, sir. No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir, I don't think so. Yes, sir, we will do that. Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, sir, we'll start listening in for you in about twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">four hours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned to Captain Hamilton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All plans made," he said. "Get busy on the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">locator so that we can get those prepared bombs placed."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All set," said Captain Hamilton tensely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right!" replied Williams. "Are you ready, Jane?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All ready," she whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Then, Gridley, you may fire!' "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Hamilton bent over an improvised induction</seg><seg type="columnLine">generator and turned it rapidly by means of a crank. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">low note became audible, rose to a shrill whine and died</seg><seg type="columnLine">456</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">away in silence and Hamilton's grunt as he strained at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crank became audible. A sudden ting! sounded on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air and the interior of the dome was plunged in in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense darkness. Williams opened the door of the watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower and Jane slipped out on her errand of destruction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deadly bombs with the detonation fuse gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to her body. The listening men heard a gruff chal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenge from the doorway followed by an answer in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Russian in Jane's voice. The guard replied in a suspi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious voice and Captain Hamilton gripped his pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly and made ready to rush to her assistance. Jane's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice rang out again with an imperious note and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard could be heard to move back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank God, she got by him," muttered Williams.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The rest should be easy for her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For five minutes the two men sat tense in the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness waiting for the sound of Jane's return.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pm going after her," announced Hamilton with sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den determination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sit down, you fool! You'll only add to her danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you try any stunt like that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Let go of me! I'm going-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without warning the lights suddenly flashed on and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interior of the huge dome was a? light as day. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the lights came on there was the sound of a scuffle just</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the doorway leading to the roof, followed by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">feminine scream. With an oath, Captain Hamilton tore</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself loose and ran across the roof, Williams at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels. Before they reached the door there was a high</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitched yell that ended suddenly in a bubbling grunt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jane appeared in the doorway, a knife streaming with</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood in her hand. After her came a dozen Mongolians</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hot pursuit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Down, Jane !" shouted Hamilton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Obediently she dropped flat and Hamilton's heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol barked a defiance to her pursuers. The Mongolians</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had no time to don their protective armor and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down like tenpins before the deadly accuracy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Hamilton's fire. The survivors paused and Williams</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang forward and lifted Jane to her feet, and raced to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the watch tower with her, Hamilton covering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreat with his pistol. Hardly had the door of the tower</seg><seg type="columnLine">slammed behind them than a fresh group appeared in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doorway clothed in the generator-fed armor. Will-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iams picked up a radite bomb and threatened their ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vance. They hesitated, but urged on by a Russian who</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained discreetly in the rear, they disregarded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">threat and pressed forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Barricade the door! Quick!" cried Williams as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran to the improvised communicator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "General Hamilton!" he cried into it, "Come ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hurry! We are being attacked in force and I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know how long we can hold out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dropped the communicator and hastened back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">aid Hamilton in dragging everything movable in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room against the door. Outside, a hundred Mongolians</seg><seg type="columnLine">howled and attacked the door with axes. The massive</seg><seg type="columnLine">teak withstood the attack for some time, but gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">it began to splinter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">• "Fire the bomb, Charley!" cried Williams. "If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't, it will be too late."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hamilton bent over his makeshift detonation projector</seg><seg type="columnLine">and closed a switch. A dull boom resounded in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed room. Williams fired his pistol pointblank through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gap in the doorway at a grinning face but his bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced no result.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Try it again, Charley!" he cried. "The first shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't do it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hamilton bent over the projector and worked des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perately. Again and again the dull boom resounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the room, sounding over the blows of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">axes which were rapidly enlarging the hole in the door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. It was large enough now to admit a man and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attackers drew back and one of them began to worm</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way through. Williams struck at him with an axe</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the blows were warded off by the impenetrable armor</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the man wore. Again Captain Hamilton closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the switch of his projector. The dull boom sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as Williams swung his axe again at the head of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entering figure. The blow went home and the Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">golian fell forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To the guns!" shouted Williams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the two machine guns mounted on each side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doorway came a stream of fire and the surviving</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mongolians turned and fled as they realized that their</seg><seg type="columnLine">armor no longer protected them. As they did so, Hamil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton turned again to his induction generator and in a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments the dome was plunged in darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Lord, we've done it now!" gasped Williams</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he pointed toward the dome above them. Through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred holes the sunlight was streaming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The argon will leak out and let nitrogen in and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the solvite will take care of this place," he cried. "Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one shot a little too high. It won't be long now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look!" cried Jane from the periscope, "Here comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abandoning their guns, the two men joined her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed at the ground glass screen of the periscope. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few miles away and splitting the air like a rocket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a heavy cruiser with the colors of the United States</seg><seg type="columnLine">emblazoned on her bow. Her propellers were suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">reversed and she slowed down and came to a halt a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards from the dome. From her bow a gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke and under the influence of the radite shell a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">section of the skin of the dome disintegrated into gas.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again the gun spoke and another section disappeared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through the gap thus formed the ship drove at a high</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed and came to a halt on the roof. A door opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a party of men streamed forth. With them they</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought three shining boxes that looked like coffins. Six</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them raced toward the watch tower with these boxes</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the balance threw themselves into a skirmish line</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the door leading into the interior of the building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men with the boxes sat them down and threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">them open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick!" cried the leader of the rescue party. "Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hunter! Captain Hamilton! Mister Williams! Into</seg><seg type="columnLine">these boxes at once!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three prisoners squeezed through the doorway</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leaped into the coffin-like boxes which were instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">slammed shut on them. The six men picked up the boxes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and carried them at a run to the waiting ship. Through</seg><seg type="columnLine">double ports they introduced them into the body of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft. A shout from their leader brought the skirmish</seg><seg type="columnLine">line to the ship and with her crew and the rescued three</seg><seg type="columnLine">on board, the aerostat shot out through the opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">which her gun had blasted in the dome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lids of two of the boxes were opened and Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hamilton was soon wringing his brother's hand while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams was receiving the congratulations and thanks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of General Hunter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is Jane?" cried Captain Hamilton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAST WAR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">457</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Still in her box," replied his brother.

In closing the box, a portion of Jane Hunter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">garment had been left outside.

As they watched, the door opened and a figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared. It staggered forward for a few steps and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly collapsed and lost form, spreading in a great Wot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of color over the landscape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you recognize him?" gasped Williams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nashky!" replied Captain Hamilton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I had an idea that he had not gone up with his ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I wasn't sure of it. At any rate, that's the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I' HERE is one thing that has been puzzling me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A ever since we got your message, General," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams. "You spoke of getting reinforcements from</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere and I can see that you have them. Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">did you get them and what sort of men are they who are</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to go out into the poisoned air without argon pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tection ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," replied General Hamilton, "that is a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">story, the details of which you must wait for until we</seg><seg type="columnLine">get to Pole Mountain. I am not a chemist and I doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I could explain, for I hardly understand it myself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The nub of the thing is that they were not born at all;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Balinsky manufactured them in the laboratory. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">we learned what your situation was, we sent a rescue</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship after you and managed to destroy Nashky's ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">but we couldn't force a way into the dome. We didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have strength enough to do so even if the Nashky gen-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">erators had not been in operation and we know that we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">needed help. There were no people left alive, so Balinsky</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">started in with Von Helmer's help and made these</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">soldiers you have seen in action today. The reason that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they are able to go into the solvite areas without argon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">protection is that they contain argon in their flesh instead</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of nitrogen. The nitrogen that is in the ordinary human</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">body had been replaced atom for atom with argon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But argon will not enter into chemical combinations,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">objected Williams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It won't ordinarily, but Ruthven of Liverpool is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">among our group and he managed to activate it so that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it would enter into combinations with the same valence</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and chemical characteristics as nitrogen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "In that case, I should think it would be affected by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">solvite."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "So Ruthven feared, but it turned out not to be so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">These men are entirely immune to solvite and can work</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in it without trouble. We had about fifty made when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we left and I expect that Balinsky will have quite a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">few more ready by the time we get home. You told us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that solvite lost its power fairly soon; in fact we can</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">see that it$ action is diminishing in virulence already;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and we are planning to make a few thousand of these</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fellows and turn them out and let them start getting the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">world policed up against the time when we can leave</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">our sanctuary at Pole Mountain and resume our in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">terrupted lives--those of us who are left."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "So it was Balinsky's doing, was it?

These</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers had been in the sole possession of the head of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the organization and were supposed to have been kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely secret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That evening a conference was held by the expedition</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaders, and the following morning the line of march</seg><seg type="columnLine">was suddenly changed, but apparently to no effect, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward evening they were again stopped and a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper, telling of what had taken place in the previous</seg><seg type="columnLine">night's conference, was laid before them. Added to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was a still further warning of the dire consequences</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would befall members of the party, should they</seg><seg type="columnLine">persist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not to be daunted, and feeling that they were suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficiently armed, they nevertheless pushed on, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world at that time knew only too well the results.

When all was finished</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the meeting ready to adjourn, a stilted voice spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the air beside them, warning that their forces</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never return. It is sufficient to state that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning was unheeded, though it momentarily threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">consternation into the group, because the speaker could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be seen or felt.

Warning to the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side world came through the silence of the telegraph and</seg><seg type="columnLine">telephone, an ominous silence that brought forth an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant inquiry from the various world press associations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A few hours later, air liners starting for those cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">came driving desperately to outside ports, telling hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible tales of an apparently instant death that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken every inhabitant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A consultation of nations was immediately called to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt to ascertain who was the unknown enemy.

Naturally the nations re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused, and perhaps equally naturally the unknown Ingol</seg><seg type="columnLine">race inflicted the promised punishment. San Francisco,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shanghai, Manila and Berlin were found three days later</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be cities of the dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a difficult thing to fight. Heavy air patrols</seg><seg type="columnLine">were established at every city of importance in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, but seemed to be of little avail. At times the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swooping ships of the enemy would be sighted, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">their speed and ability of maneuver were so far ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those modern planes known to civilization, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter were helpless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A patrol would spot the enemy as a dot high in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky, would attempt to swing to bring their guns to bear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to find that the speed of the Ingol ships was such</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had struck their blow and were zooming high</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of range before a single retaliatory measure could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be taken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is true they did not entirely escape. A flight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine enemy planes traveling at the 4100 meter level over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dallas, Texas, entered a storm area and upon coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">into clear atmosphere at the far side, plunged unex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectedly full upon two patrols. Neither flight had time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to touch a control and the resulting collision wrecked</seg><seg type="columnLine">three of the enemy as well as the two American ships.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the accident brought no results, for the wreckage</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell so tangled that nothing of the construction or motive</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of the strangers could be determined, save that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were of a radically new type.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scientists everywhere were working upon the problem,</seg><seg type="columnLine">particularly with the view of discovering the means used</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the Ingols to project their voices and to learn, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible, whether other senses were projected as well.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But their work apparently brought no results.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was an amateur photographer working on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Portland Evening Journal who finally furnished the key.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He discovered for himself a phenomenon, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">already known by other photographers and opticians,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was his application of this discovery that pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way to final success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MERLE AIKEN, and there are many who will rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ognize that name now that it is mentioned in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">connection, was engaged in making some photographic</seg><seg type="columnLine">copies. He had thrown the light of four 500-watt flood</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamps upon the copyboard and had just brought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">copying camera into focus. Turning to pick up a plate</seg><seg type="columnLine">holder he accidently struck the ground glass of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camera, shattering it to bits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rest of the room was in darkness, save for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">diffused reflection from the lamps, and Aiken stepped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shelf on the far side to try to locate a duplicate fo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussing plate. The shutter of the camera was left open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could not find what he was looking for and, stop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping a moment in puzzlement, he happened to glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the camera.

Looking a little beyond or a little short of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that particular spot in the air, nothing was visible, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the eyes focussed on the proper plane, the picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">was even more brilliant than it would have been with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a glass interceptor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He studied it a few moments in amazement, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">changing the position of the lens a bit, he again tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick up the image in the air. It was without result.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taking a sheet of thin paper, he carried it backward</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the camera until the image was clear upon it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marking the place as carefully as he could, he again</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped back into the partially darkened room and at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted to look into space at the point where he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">held the paper. Instantly the picture was again visible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeming to stand free in the air some five feet to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear of the camera.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Calling one of the men working near, he asked him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">step before the floodlights. Placing the lens in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him, Aiken again took his place at the far end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and after a moment there stood his companion, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural color and with every changing expression of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, suspended in nothingness!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aiken could scarcely believe his senses. It was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">radically new to him. Taking a ruler, he threw it toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the image. Naturally it -passed through and beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">without in any way affecting the brilliance of the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aiken also dabbled a little in radio, not enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly understand all its principles, but enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize something of the unexplored wonders of radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some days went by, with Aiken thinking more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of the discovery he had made. If it was possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to project an image into nothingness by light, why not by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some other form of vibration. But, of course, that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">already been done. He suddenly remembered the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periments in radio photography where even moving pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures were transmitted hundreds of miles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, why not go a bit farther? Why not hit upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">some wave that could act not only as a sender, but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">receiver as well ? Within limits that had also been done.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A telephone transmitter could be used also as a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiver; a radio receiver could be made to oscillate and</seg><seg type="columnLine">send out those horrible howls that so annoyed him, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was trying to get DX reception. True, those were</seg><seg type="columnLine">but extremely crude beginnings of the idea he had in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, but it was just possible that it could be done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Merle Aiken had reached that stage in his reasoning</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a second world conference was called at Denver.</seg><seg type="columnLine">During that meeting the figure of the Ingol chieftain was</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly seen standing at the side of the delegates' table.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The place had been well guarded and the diplomats were</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken dumb with astonishment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The President of the United States was the first to</seg><seg type="columnLine">recover his equilibrium.

Technical terms, instruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions and suggestions far over the photographer's head</seg><seg type="columnLine">left him dizzy, and he stepped outside to await further</seg><seg type="columnLine">developments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next night Hastings called for him. "We're going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to try it. Want to be there ?" Aiken most certainly did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The room was darkened. A huge screen stood facing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the observers. Elaborate radio equipment was paneled</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath it. An operator stood tense, lightly fingering</seg><seg type="columnLine">the control dials.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Between the scientists and the receiving disc, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what lower down, was the sending panel with Hastings</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the controls. He threw a switch and his body was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathed in a greenish-yellow light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll focus it at a thousand feet, on Broadway, Jensen,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he spoke to the receiving operator. Carefully Jensen</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjusted the controls. The screen slowly took color, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hazy mirage drifting with light and shadow. More care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully he adjusted the dials, and suddenly Broadway in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">its splendor of night life snapped upon the screen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've got it, fellows, we've got it!" Hastings' ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultant shout startled the observers almost as much as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene before their eyes. But what followed was even</seg><seg type="columnLine">more surprising. People in the near foreground stopped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and looked upward directly toward what ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to be the center of the screen. Their faces turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashen. Some fainted, others fled terror-stricken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the ... ?" Then comprehension came. Hast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings jerked the switch that controlled the peculiar light</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathing him and snapped on the ceiling lights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somewhat sheepishly he explained. "I forgot that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see me sitting there in the sky and hear me speak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Naturally they were scared." Turning to Jensen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let's try it in the mountains this time, say on Fisher's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peak, just south of Trinidad. Let's see, that's 212 miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">from here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the strange light, adjustments by Jensen, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the level plateau of the top of the mountain stood before</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. More experiments, at greater and greater dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tances, brought corresponding success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But how to profit by it, that was the next question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen, Hastings." It was Aiken that spoke. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you could find that valley of the Ingols, we might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to see what they are doing, and perhaps get an idea."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Merle, you ought to be a fiction writer. Every worth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">while idea we have had on this deal has come from you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Science may have worked them out, but it has been your</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination that has kept us on the right track. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">goes!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turning to Jensen, he gave instructions to pick him up</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Lima, Peru, as a starting point and follow the beam</seg><seg type="columnLine">back through the mountains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was but a few minutes' work to find the image of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distant city, then rapidly the mountains swept across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screen under the guiding hands of Hastings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jensen. Hundreds of miles of mountainous valleys were</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept by -the exploring beam, until far in the fastnesses</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the upper Andes, lights appeared in a precipitous</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly the scene seemed to draw near, as though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">witnesses were in a plane hovering above the spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hastings turned a dial that changed the glow flooding</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from a greenish yellow to a deep violet.

Let's go down to the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jensen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AGAIN the scene rose, until those in the room seemed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">-	to be standing at the earth level. People passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, seemed to walk into the screen and step into</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothingness in the room. "That fellow must have walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">right through me," Hastings' awed voice muttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They located and explored the palace; they found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple of the Sun-God, and there witnessed the horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacrifice of one of the maidens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a terrible yet strangely fascinating scene that</seg><seg type="columnLine">played before their eyes. The brilliant sunlight, playing</seg><seg type="columnLine">over massive masonry and colorful costumes, seemed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">contrast to make the scene even more unreal. It ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared a bit of wild imagining that might have thrilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the audience of a movie palace, but blanched the faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the strong men who in that darkened room were wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nessing it. They realized only too well how true it was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They could see the mercifully drug-deadened girl, beauti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful even to the eyes of an Anglo-Saxon, and knew what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in store for her. They would have looked away had</seg><seg type="columnLine">it been possible, but they could not. They could only</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip the arms of their chairs and struggle for breath, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they watched the terrible scene mirrored on the screen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A great crowd stood about the open area below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple. Beyond them rose, the heavy stonework, faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a row of squat columns. A line of hieroglyphs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inca writing, was chiseled across the facade of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That means 'Atahualpa'--old Inca ruler--killed 200</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his brothers and drank the blood of other royal rela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tives--thought it was a charm--wanted to wipe out all</seg><seg type="columnLine">traces of royalty," one of the scientists explained in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">awed whisper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On a great platform of stone extending out from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of the steps leading into the temple, there stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">the form of the Ingol chieftain already familiar to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">statesmen of the world. His body was bare, the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin glistening in the sunlight like polished bronze. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">jeweled garment hung from his hips; chains of jewels and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold about his neck.

Two black hooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">priests strode solemnly forward and took their places at</seg><seg type="columnLine">each side of the sacrificial stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The music started, if it could be called music--a dole-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful minor tone that gradually grew in volume and wailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward in a crazy crescendo of sound. It crashed to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">climax and stopped. All eyes of the multitude turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the narrow passageway down which the stagger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing maiden was being led. Slowly she mounted the plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form and stood while the music again took up its dirge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mysterious rites were performed over her, then she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">led to the stone and laid in place. The priests advanced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripping their robes and hoods from their bodies, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood forth naked, their forms horribly caricatured in</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaming paint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They raised their hands in a final pagan prayer to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sun, then turned again to the fainting girl.

It hung poised an instant, then started its</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward sweep. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mirror went dark. With a gasping cry Hastings</seg><seg type="columnLine">had switched off the power. It was too terrible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch. The ceiling lights came on, and the men looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one another with blanched faces, unable to believe what</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had witnessed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Minutes passed while they sat paralyzed by the experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence, then with a shudder, Hastings turned again to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument board and with a change of adjustments set</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screen in operation. But he did not go back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They searched the valley and found the plane hangars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the ships of destruction standing within. Similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our own planes in outward appearance, yet somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">different, they stood in long lines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wings were much shorter and swooped back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward more in the form of a hawk's wing on a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">dive. They seemed to be connected to the forward end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fuselage with a flexible joint that permitted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire wing to serve as elevator and rudder, though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail also carried a rudder vane much like those we knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but considerably smaller. The elevator vanes appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the regular-size.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Propellers were missing. No propulsive means were</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible, unless they lay in a series of small tubes about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the diameter of a .45 caliber revolver barrel. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes were arranged in three sets, the largest number</seg><seg type="columnLine">being laid flat along the under surface of the wings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the openings pointing directly astern. A second set</seg><seg type="columnLine">was located in the bottom of the fuselage, opening down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, and the third set, consisting of five tubes, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed in the nose of each plane, being used apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">as brakes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later investigations proved that our original supposi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was indeed correct, and that the tubes shot forth a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible driving charge much on the line of our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket-powered machines, save that the Ingols had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped a system of utilizing the breakdown of atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">structures from which to derive their power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Comparatively little time was spent in the first in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestigation, for a new danger occurred to Jensen. If it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was possible for our scientists to pry into the secrets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ingols, it was equally possible, and indeed probable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the enemy's exploring beam would find the labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory. Accordingly work was interrupted while a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grounded insulating screen was thrown over the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, equipped with movable apertures to permit the out-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">going beam to pass, yet which would prevent most of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger of discovery by the Ingols. Their beam would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be effectively insulated and pass into the ground should it</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike the building, unless by some chance it happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to touch the exact spot, where the two-foot opening al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed the passage of our own carrier wave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TT was at this stage of the game that the period of</seg><seg type="columnLine">A thirty days' grace expired. Representatives of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nations were gathered in conference, awaiting the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance of the Ingol. It had been decided that, should</seg><seg type="columnLine">an extension of time be refused, nothing could be done</seg><seg type="columnLine">but acquiesce, for only by seeming to agree could a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholesale slaughter be averted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hastings, Jensen, Aiken and a group of the scientists</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in the laboratory a few minutes before the inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">national conference was called to order. The instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments were adjusted and focussed on the throne room</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Ingol chieftain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There they saw a similar equipment to their own.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before the sending apparatus stood the warrior, march-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up and down. Presently he stopped and the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">light bathed him also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A slight change of adjustment and the spectators in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denver laboratory appeared to be standing behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chieftain, looking as he did toward the oval receiving</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen. On that screen they saw pictured the conference</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Capitol building. They saw the Ingol smile a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cynical smile at the harassed expressions on the faces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the diplomats.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scientists sat silent, listening to the words of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ingol spoken in his stilted English and to the replies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the President, who served as spokesman for the nations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your answer! Do you choose submission or death?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Honorable Ingol, we have considered you and your</seg><seg type="columnLine">race among the highest of ancient civilizations," stated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the President evasively.

Those in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory saw his image in Ingol-land turn from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen and look toward his advisors and sub-chieftains.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The appearance of the Ingol in the conference room</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been as though he was looking off into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance, considering the proposition. He nodded his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, apparently in thought. The diplomats looked re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved, but those in the laboratory saw helmeted figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurriedly rise and leave the chamber, disappearing down</seg><seg type="columnLine">a corridor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Ingol turned again toward the President. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall consider it, but at the first sign of retaliation on</seg><seg type="columnLine">your part, death will rain down upon you." The chief-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain's screen went dead, and he turned with a cynical</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile toward his throne.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick, Jensen, the air field," spoke Hastings. Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planes came into view rolling slowly into the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the star-studded sky of that far land. They hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated a moment as they took formation, then swiftly rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost vertically with a faintly luminous blast of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power tubes showing beneath and astern of the ships.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Into the leading plane, Jensen!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN INCA-LAND REVOLTED</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">465</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scene changed and showed the interior of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speeding fighting machine. A half dozen dark-skinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were swiftly yet surely placing equipment in posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Short mortar-shaped guns of some sort were</seg><seg type="columnLine">being trained through openings in the floor. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeches were charged with a powdery substance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wire connections made to a control board before which</seg><seg type="columnLine">another figure sat watching a multitude of gauges and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflecting plate equipped with hairlines, which showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the territory over which they were flying. A dupli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate plate before the pilot, coupled with telephonic com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munication between the two men, enabled instant co-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordination when in the stress of battle. Control of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane seemed to be with the operator at the firing board,</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders being issued by him to other members of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew. '</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the screen in Denver a tense group watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight of the enemy planes. In their own viewing plate</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could see the image of the ground beneath the ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as reflected in the latter's plate. Sweeping steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">north, the plane crossed the vast mountain ranges al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most with the speed of sound, it seemed. Soon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gulf showed below, then presently land again. Hast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings announced it must be Texas. The plane, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flight leader for the squadron, apparently was taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">a direct course for Denver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as the course was ascertained, Hastings called</seg><seg type="columnLine">the President and advised immediate evacuation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city in as quiet a manner as possible, to prevent needless</seg><seg type="columnLine">deaths should the Ingols fail to abide by the agreement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AN army officer of the anti-craft division of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">-	Field Artillery was a member of the interested</seg><seg type="columnLine">audience watching the flight of the enemy planes. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the next idea of importance came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was granted that, even being able to discover the</seg><seg type="columnLine">means by which the strange planes were driven, it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">still be impossible to construct ships that could meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in battle within the short length of time left before</seg><seg type="columnLine">a definite answer must be given. The world's hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be pinned on some type of offensive defense,</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that apparently was purely for the protection</seg><seg type="columnLine">of civilized peoples, yet something that would at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time strike a telling blow at the heart of the Ingol</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronghold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Distances from the Valley of Yazutak were so great</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a land expedition was not feared. Any attack that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ingols would make would of necessity come from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, and naturally any defense or offensive movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to be made through the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Hastings," spoke Major Eberling White, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have an idea, if you can supply your end of it. Can you</seg><seg type="columnLine">give me, by watching the interior of that ship there, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, elevation, and speed that it is making?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hastings glanced at the viewing plate. He saw pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured on it the instruments of the pilot, saw that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane at that time was following a compass course of</seg><seg type="columnLine">N-10-W, saw that the speed indicator registered a sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolic figure that was easily translated through timing its</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight over known cities into 420 miles an hour, placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">its elevation in a third instrument.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Major, I can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Umm-m-m! Well, Hastings, can you tell me at any</seg><seg type="columnLine">given instant just exactly where the plane is in relation</seg><seg type="columnLine">to points on a large scale map?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not now, Major, but when it is in familiar territory,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">where I can place myself in her firing finder, I can give</seg><seg type="columnLine">you the exact location."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I notice, Hastings, that except in actual battle per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps, the ship seems to hold a fairly even course and</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed. It might be possible to compute thirty seconds in</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance exactly where she would be. Yes, um-m-m, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">most certainly would." The Major seemed to be talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">more to himself than to the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That being so, should they fly within range of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">new anti-aircraft guns, and keep under 10,000 meters, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be quite possible to bracket them, and ra all</seg><seg type="columnLine">probability bring them down. Umm-m-m, quite so."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Major thought in silence for a moment, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others watched him anxiously. Quite evidently he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">an idea that might prove of vital importance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Umm-m-m. I say, Hastings, how long will it be be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore these planes are over Denver?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About an hour and three-quarters, Major. They are</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the central part of Texas now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good!" Major White stepped rapidly across to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone and called his battery. "Send plotters and instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments to the laboratory immediately. Man the guns and</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon order fire as per directions from me in groups of</seg><seg type="columnLine">four. It will require every ounce of speed you can put</seg><seg type="columnLine">into it, for there are five ships and we have 12 guns. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">sets will have to fire twice, all with perfect hits, before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they can bring their planes to bear or we shall be wiped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. It is the only chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the Major called central. "Maintain these lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">open to Battery C with absolutely no interference, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter what the apparent urgency. Major Eberling</seg><seg type="columnLine">White speaking. . . . Very good, thank you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few minutes later the sound of speeding motorcycles</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew near and a moment after a half dozen tense-faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">young officers stepped into the room. Tables were</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly arranged under the direction of the Major and</seg><seg type="columnLine">instructions given to Hastings to compute the distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart and form of flight the enemy planes were holding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If we can fire within 500 feet, we can bring them</seg><seg type="columnLine">down with those new shells. Their explosive range is</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific. . . . Got it, Hastings?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Major. 'V' formation, 80 degree angle, planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">spaced 250 feet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Major was evidently highly elated. "Good, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">battery may bring down more than one plane. Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grayson," speaking to the officer in charge of the plot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting crew, "you will compute for firing at thirty second</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervals. Mr. Hastings will give you the necessary de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tails. There must be no mistake."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir." Captain Grayson turned to the men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">apportioned their duties, then to Hastings and got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">starting point at which it seemed the planes would enter</seg><seg type="columnLine">the extreme range. This was plotted on the map.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Major White turned to the phone and gave terse instruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions to the firing officer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lieutenant, you will train all guns to one setting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">firing them in groups of four at one-third second inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vals. Instantly stand by for change in range and on in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction fire again in the same order. Battery firing will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be automatic at thirty-second intervals after your first</seg><seg type="columnLine">order. Clear? . . . Very good."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIVE minutes later Hastings informed Captain Gray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son that the planes were approaching the range line.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He gave the elevation, speed and course. A moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">later he gave the line of crossing the predetermined area.</seg><seg type="columnLine">466</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Instantly the five men at the table sprang into feverish</seg><seg type="columnLine">activity. Captain Grayson stood tense, holding the phone</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the Major had released to him. His eyes on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch, he spoke swiftly into the transmitter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stand by. Fire in 27 seconds." The plotting of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficers reported their computations, the captain instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeating them into the phone. "Range 92°. Elevation</seg><seg type="columnLine">48° 32' 21". Quadrant 176° 27' 19". Ready--Fire!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Simultaneously with his command, men standing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the windows looking toward the location of the bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teries saw thin lines of flame shoot heavenward, followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few moments later by groups of blinding flashes high</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the skies. Seconds afterward the reverberations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those rending concussions came to their ears, muffled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile the Captain was again speaking. "Range</seg><seg type="columnLine">3325. Elevation 86° 05' 52", spread Quadrant five de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grees centering 94® 35'." In that thirty seconds the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy planes had time to travel almost three and a half</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles and were now a little east of the batteries and</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically directly overhead. Again came the flash of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the firing, interrupted by Hastings' excited shout.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Four of them the first time!" The view had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">set back so that the entire group might be seen. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader is wobbling. Half a wing is gone. He is coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, tight spiral to keep right side up. Oh-h-h!" A</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinding flash had come from the bottom of the plane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Hastings realized it meant the firing of the Ingols'</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly guns on the area beneath them. "Captain, he'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">land in segment 76-K."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, firing officer, barrage battery--gas 109--76-K.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At will!" The plane had scarcely landed in the area of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death before the shells of the barrage began falling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The plane was not struck, though the ground all about it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was torn into deep craters. A half dozen shells had</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed and members of the crew of the fighting plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be seen to drop to the ground, unconscious from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the effects of the stupefying gas. The Captain ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Cease firing" and instructed a detail to enter the area</seg><seg type="columnLine">and capture any of the enemy yet living.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first raid was ended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The actual capture of the two stupefied men remain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing alive after the crash needs little comment. It can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found in detail in the average school history of today.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The plane itself, as well as the others of the flight were</seg><seg type="columnLine">so wrecked as to be useless for scientific study as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their construction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'T'HE army men and those others gathered in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkened room naturally anticipated immediate</seg><seg type="columnLine">retributioif from the Ingol chieftain, and laid plans ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cordingly. They could not hope for the same luck on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next invasion, for undoubtedly, to their way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking, the flight had been watched, even as they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched it, and adequate care would be taken to prevent</seg><seg type="columnLine">a recurrence of the surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As it turned out, however, the Ingols had not dreamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a catastrophe of this sort and had no knowledge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate their fliers had met. Moreover, they were unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">locate the wreckage under the camouflage and so it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not until several days had elapsed that they became cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain that the planes were gone. Even then they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not aware of the means by Which the defeat had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meantime, figuring that a second flight would</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow approximately the same course as the first until</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">comparatively near their destination, the army authorities</seg><seg type="columnLine">had established their guns much farther to the south,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the line at which the Ingol planes would probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin to change courses should they be suspicious as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had befallen their earlier companions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This new location was connected by direct phone lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the laboratory and arrangements made for dupli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cating the first victory, should that be at all possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile, Jensen and Hastings had kept the view</seg><seg type="columnLine">plate tuned on the airfield in Ingol-land and had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">turns sleeping so that a full 24-hour watch might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was early on the fourth day, with Jensen on watch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that warning of the second raid came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stately Ingol had appeared but once, the evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, when his form became apparent to the statesmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">convened in the conference hall. Reports of those pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent stated his appearance was terrible to see. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been visible but a moment and had spoken but few words:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We have received your answer. You shall kneel before</seg><seg type="columnLine">my throne and beg for mercy that we shall not grant."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately evacuation of Denver and the neighbor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing cities started, and army preparations reached a</seg><seg type="columnLine">frenzied pitch. False leads of air activity were apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">everywhere, intended to divert the attention of the Ingols,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who, it was known, would be watching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile a third line of defense was being arranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the extreme southern edge of Texas. This was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain silent during the next anticipated flight and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be called into action only in case of a third punitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">expedition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nine enemy planes took off just at sunrise. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">course was closely watched by those in the laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">and once again unbelievable good fortune came to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American gunners. Seven of the ships were brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at the first burst. The other two wriggled through</seg><seg type="columnLine">but their propelling mechanism was so damaged that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were forced to descend and were captured with the ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fairly good condition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Prior to this, crated plane parts for ships of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speediest type were en route from San Francisco to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast of Peru on board a specially chartered and rebuilt</seg><seg type="columnLine">tramp steamer. To all appearances this vessel had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">connection with the army or navy forces of the Allied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Governments, but seemed to be nothing but a wandering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rust-covered and unpainted vagabond of the seas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Below deck, however, crews of mechanics were hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riedly unpacking and assembling these planes into ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fective fighting units. Portholes had been shaded and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire working area screened against the prying ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Ingol personality projector, as a safeguard against</seg><seg type="columnLine">detection. Forced draft ventilators enabled the men to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work in comfort and even tune up the motors so they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would instantly be ready to take the air at a signal from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the President.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This vessel, which had steamed at full power until</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the Canal Zone, was at this time lolling easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the seas under bare steerage way to prevent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessity of having to lay over for a suspicious length of</seg><seg type="columnLine">time off the Peruvian coast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A check-up from the laboratory on the Ingol airfield</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed five planes only remaining. It was a possibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">that jOthers lay hidden somewhere, but Hastings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jensen thought it unlikely, for every nook and cranny</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been thoroughly investigated. Apparently the</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN INC ALAND REVOLTED</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">467</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ingols had felt that their ships were invincible, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparatively small number already captured, wrecked</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in reserve, had constituted their entire fleet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IMMEDIATELY after the destruction of the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight of planes, Hastings had ordered the view plate</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned on the Ingol palace. There had been no time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">check on the activities of the Chieftain during the actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">raid, but following the crashes and destruction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy ships, an inspection of the throne and assembly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms there showed the surprise and consternation with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the unexpected reversal had been received.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An element of fear and uncertainty seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">registered on the faces of the leaders. Also there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fanatical light of almost crazy determination in the eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the High Chieftain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They seemed to fear the risk of losing the balance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fleet, yet there was no other way by which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">might bring the war into the borders of the Allied Na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. They reached their decision shortly after mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night of the day of their second failure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those in the laboratory watched the flyers again roll</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the planes and make preparations for a third expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition. Warning was sent to the sea tramp rolling idly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the waves fifty miles off shore to stand by. A mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment's switch of the view mirror to that point showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the huge hatch being removed and the false super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure of the after deck being dumped into the sea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which revealed a take-off and landing platform beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Ingol planes took to the air, and immediately an</seg><seg type="columnLine">order went to the tramp. Their booms speedily lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Allies' planes to the deck and one by one they took to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air also, circling about the mother ship until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">formations were complete, then headed through the early</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning darkness toward the seacoast far to the east.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one knows what the plans of the Ingol Chieftain</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, and there will probably never be any way to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">them now. Evidently he underestimated the resource-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fulness of the Allied Nations in establishing undiscovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the third and farthest-flung line of defense, for the Ingol</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines again followed the course of the first two</seg><seg type="columnLine">flights until the coast of Texas was reached. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had ordered those five planes to pick up that well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known landmark, then change their courses to avoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger. Whatever the orders, the five planes flew un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspectingly into the danger zone and once again the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">salvo from the hidden guns brought the ships to earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite the fact that last instant corrections of the eleva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion had to be made due to a sudden zoom of the man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds. At the rate they were zooming, another ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds would have placed them safely beyond the reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Allied guns. But the result remained the same--</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were brought down to earth as had been their pred-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ecessors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately this was done, Hastings ordered the Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lied planes picked up. They were found just entering</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountain regions back of Lima. Turning his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the ship of the flight leader, Hastings gave detailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">instructions for the course to be followed until the hid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den valley should be reached. The1 panes' Were then to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cirele at 10,000 meters until Hastings again returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with further instructions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The viewplate was then turned on the Ingol palace</seg><seg type="columnLine">and once again found there not only fear but consterna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. A great mob of the natives milled about the outer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">area. The Chieftain and his lieutenants were gazing hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror-stricken on the scene of the last crash. Their plate</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed the tangled masses of wreckage and the throngs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of people circling about them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hastings snapped the switch that changed the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">flooding him from deep violet to the greenish-yellow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vibration that made his person visible and his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">audible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "High Chieftain," he spoke. The group whipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">about and gazed awe-stricken at the sudden apparition.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"High Chieftain, the time of reckoning has come. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak on instruction of our President. Your planes are</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and it is our turn to demand submission.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We didn't want this war. You brought it on your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves. That we have penetrated many of your secrets</seg><seg type="columnLine">is our good fortune and your loss. Our war planes are</seg><seg type="columnLine">now circling above you.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">recent review in Nature attempted to answer the</seg><seg type="columnLine">question of what are the practical uses of multi*</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensional geometry. The review instanced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">statistical work of Dr. R. A. Fisher, Chief Statis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tician at Rothamsted Experimental Station (Har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">penden) and author of "Statistical Methods for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Research Workers." Dr. Fisher's work is based</seg><seg type="columnLine">in many cases upon n-dimensional space and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">application of statistics to, say, the counting of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bacteria upon six parallel plates may be regarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a re-projection into our three-dimensional space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">continuum of a five-dimensional occurrence. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">five plates are in question, there are four degrees</seg><seg type="columnLine">of freedom, or, in other words, four dimensions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The investigation of garden soil may therefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring the fourth dimension right to our doors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After reading your praise of Wes so as a star</seg><seg type="columnLine">artist, it was rather a shock to find that such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant illustrator of scientific tales should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same idea of a bio-chemical laboratory as has</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ordinary advertisement artist. The chemical</seg><seg type="columnLine">retort and the footed glass may be said to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">extinct except in the imagination of such artists,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who invariably proceed on the lines that "no</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory is complete without one." Moreover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shapes and dispositions they adopt are such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never be adopted by any chemist. I notice</seg><seg type="columnLine">a number of other details, but I do not intend</seg><seg type="columnLine">niggling criticisms: I do not ask that Wes so be</seg><seg type="columnLine">an expert chemist, for if he were that, he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly be an illustrator as well. I do suggest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, that he might get well ahead of other</seg><seg type="columnLine">artists who have these funny notions of retorts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Especially should a scientific artist have a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of proportion about his apparatus!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The author of "Into the Valley of Death" is</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite right about the toughness of manganese steel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, until recently, could not be machined.

We know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for instance, that the Perseid stream must be very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thick, for it takes the Earth between fifteen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty days to get through it, varying at dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent years, depending on the thickness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarm at that place, and by investigation into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hourly rate we find the thickness at all points of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stream, consequently the more observations we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have, the better.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Perseids will unfortunately be somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoiled by bright moonlight this year, but I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be very glad to receive observations from anyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested, on any night of the year.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In observing the exact time of beginning ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servations and ending should be noted, and ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servations of under one hour are of little value;</seg><seg type="columnLine">two to four hour stands are preferable, and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">account of the condition of the sky should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted, such as--"Clouds passing through Ursa</seg><seg type="columnLine">Major and Draco, 9:18-9:37," or "Haze inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fering at times," etc. This is essential if we arc</seg><seg type="columnLine">to gauge the hourly rate accurately, and if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky is hazy or even partly cloudly, or with more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a half-moon, observations are inadvisable, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">so few are seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the observer is familiar with the constella-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, the path of the meteor, if well-seen, should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be noted, such as--"From half a degree above</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alpha Tauri to a point midway between Mu and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nu Tauri," and on a blank, the color, brightness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">color of train (if any), and duration, and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting peculiarities such as a train of sparks</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a two-headed meteor, etc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As to the brightness or magnitude of a meteor</seg><seg type="columnLine">or fireball, the full moon is reckoned at 12.5, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-moon 6, Venus 4, Jupiter 3, Sirius 2, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">two magnitudes down the scale, Voga and Capella</seg><seg type="columnLine">arc reckoned at about 0.0, Aldebaran, Alpha Cygni,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Antares at 1, and the stars in the Orion Belt</seg><seg type="columnLine">at 2. From this standard scale, the reader may</seg><seg type="columnLine">continue on down for himself. The 6th magni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude is the absolute limit of naked-eye vision, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the average meteor is 3rd or 4th magnitude, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginners invariably overestimate brightness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">duration both. The average meteor exists about</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a second, although different showers average</seg><seg type="columnLine">differently. The August Perseids often leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">trains for 3 to 5 seconds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                   Bert C.

However, that is not of the first importance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">If Amazing Stories were published on wrapping</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">paper, it would make not the slightest difference</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to me; I'd buy it and like it, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  One thing I would like to have you change,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">though, is your habit of publishing novelettes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">(stories of two-issue length) as serials. Why can't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you publish them complete in one issue, as "Death</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">From the Skies" was? If that would take too</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">much space, you could save them for the Quarter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ly. If you desire to publish serials, and publish-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing serials is a thing no editor can resist, why</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">don't you print complete books? Serials should</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be books, anyhow. All the three-issue stories were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">most excellent, for example, "The Moon Pool,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The Skylark of Space," etc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Another thing under discussion is your staff</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of artists, and their drawings. Above all stands</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Wesso, artist supreme. Even the great Paul him-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">self cannot hope to rival Wesso. Wesso has a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wonderful imagination. His drawings of "The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Man From Space" in the current issue show</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that. He also knows his scientific instruments, as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shown by his illustrations for "A Baby on Nep-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tune" and others. And, boy! how that man can</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drawl It His human beings are human, too. As</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for shadings and the like, just take a glimpse at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Quarterly's pictures for "The Other Side of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Moon." What a combination: imagination,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">remarkable ability to draw, and a knowledge of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scientific instruments. What other quality need</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a scientific artist possess? I am exceedingly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sorry, not to say alarmed, at seeing only two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stories illustrated by Wesso in the present issue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The cover is also by another artist. By the way,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the artist who drew the cover for the February</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">issue (Morey) is Wesso's biggest threat. He is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">no mean illustrator, but he can in no way rival</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Wesso. I can't say that I care much for the other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">artists, namely, McKay, Wallitt, Bob Dean, etc.,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but Anderson (he drew the picture for "The Ice</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Man") is pretty fair. But please have Wesso</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">draw the cover and the pictures for nearly, if not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all, the stories, with Morey as second best.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I also favor Wesso's method of having several</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pictures for each story, instead of only one, as the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rest do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Also, why don't you organize a good re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">print department?

"The Corpse That Lived" would not seem to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">belong in Amazing Stories as much as in some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other magazine. "The Fourth Dimensional Space-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Penetrator" was excellent.

The mass of the sun is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about 332,000 times that of the earth, and its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">distance is about 390 times that from the earth to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the moon, which gives</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">332,000</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--or a little over two.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     390*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Therefore, the sun attracts the moon with a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">force over twice as great as the earth's attrac-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion, yet the moon does not leave the earth to re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">volve around the sun. If the earth could be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stopped in its orbit and remain fixed, the sun</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would pull the moon away, but both the earth and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the moon are free to move and they revolve around</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the sun as a system, not as isolated bodies. In</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other words, it is the center of the earth-moon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">system that revolves around the sun once a year</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in an elliptical orbit, while both the center of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">earth and the center of the moon revolve once a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">month around the same system. This center of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mass is situated on a line between the two centers,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and lies about one thousand miles below the sur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">face of the earth on the side toward the moon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   To find the effective force tending to pull the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> moon away to the sun, we must take the difference</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> in the acceleration produced on both the earth and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> moon when the moon is on the side nearest the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> sun at new moon. At that time, the sun is pulling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> both the earth and the moon, but the acceleration</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> on the moon, force divided by the moon's mass is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> greater than the acceleration on the earth because</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the moon is nearer the sun than the earth is. It is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> this difference in acceleration that measures the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> effective attraction of the sun on the moon tending</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to pull it away from the earth, and that quantity</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> is quite small compared to the attraction of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> earth, which has to be overcome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The same conditions, of course, may be applied to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the case of the hypothetical satellite of Venus at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a distance of a million miles. On the side nearest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to the sun it would be about sixty-six million</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> miles distant, and Venus would be about sixty-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> seven million miles. The relative acceleration</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> would then be,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Sun on Satellite -- 67* or approximately 4489</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Sun on Venus = 66! or approximately 43S6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Therefore -- is the proportional part of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> sun's attraction on the satellite tending to pull it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> away from Venus.
